The FBI Releases a Memo to Northwest Officials

Officials all over the northwest received a memo describing the current risk both states power grids face. According to the memo ""Power companies in Oregon and Washington have reported physical attacks on substations using hand tools, arson, firearms, and metal chains possibly in response to an online call for attacks on critical infrastructure"" reported by King5 News.

Multiple Attacks Have Been Reported in the Northwest

Right now I can find reports of up to 8 different attacks on Northwest power grid infrastructure. Two of those attacks are reported to be similar to the attacks recently in North Carolina. The memo goes on to warn ""We are aware of recent threats on power systems across the country and take these very seriously. We are monitoring our infrastructure and can confirm we have had two incidents occur in late November at two different substations. Both incidents are under investigation by the FBI.""

How Did the Power Grid Get Attacked?

In the memo it describes ""In recent attacks, criminal actors bypassed security by cutting the fence links, lighting nearby fires, shooting equipment from a distance or throwing objects over the fence and onto equipment."" One of the largest energy providers in Washington, Puget Sound Energy, said that two attacks happened to their sites in late November.

4 Other Northwest Power Companies Report 6 More Attacks

The Bonneville Power Administration, Cowlitz County Public Utility District, Portland General Electric, and Puget Sound Energy together say they have had 6 more attacks on their sites recently according to reporting by Oregon Public Broadcasting and KUOW Public Radio. They report that the attacks were caused by gunfire and that some customers suffered a short loss of power. All of the companies say they are cooperating with the FBI.

Who is Responsible for These Power Grid Attacks?

The FBI did not blame any group and so far there have not been any groups that have come forward to take credit. There are some theories that the attacks are politically motivated. Reporter Ali Winston told King5 that ""The trope of attacking power infrastructure, of hitting the electrical grid, critical infrastructure, is an old tenet of the American extreme right wing."" He has spent years studying and reporting on extremist groups. The FBI says if you witness strange activity or a direct attack on your local power grid, please call your local law enforcement.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1721169/pm-formed-body-asks-censors-to-review-joyland,PM-formed body asks censors to review Joyland,"ISLAMABAD: The fate of Pakistan’s Oscar entry, Joyland, hangs in the balance, as a special committee formed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to evaluate complaints filed against the recently banned film recommended that the Central Board of Film Censors should conduct a full board review and take a final decision about its suitability for screening in the country.

The Urdu film was banned for being ‘indecent and immoral’, almost a week before its release.

The committee comprising minister for political affairs, economic affairs, and law and justice, minister for information and broadcasting, minister for communications, minister for board of investment, minister for information technology and telecommunications, adviser to the PM on Gilgit-Baltistan, PTA chairman and Pemra chairman met on Tuesday.

A notification earlier issued by PM House regarding the formation of the special committee suggested that it would “consider the complaints against the said film being against the social and moral norms, and recommend follow-up action”.

Despite being Pakistan’s first Cannes entry bagging several awards at international film festivals and being chosen as the official entry for the Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars, Joyland was banned from a cinematic screening in the country. The Ministry of Information & Broad­casting cancelled its exhibition licence, which had been issued months ago.

The ban drew a strong backlash from the cast and crew of the project. Director Saim Sadiq said: “We, as a team, are gutted by this development. I am compelled to say that this sudden U-turn of the Ministry of Information and Broadc­asting is absolutely unconstitutional and illegal.”

I came across the stories while researching a different topic and thought about the progress made in two generations. In my lifetime, American society went from the kind of condemnation requiring anonymity to interracial relationships becoming the norm.

Gallup has done polling on this issue for decades. In 1958, only 4% of Americans approved of marriages between Black and white people. Last year, it was at 94%. I’m pretty curious (and suspicious) about the 6% disapproving.

It strikes me as particularly relevant as the U.S. Senate this past week passed (61-36) the Respect for Marriage Act, which adds protections for interracial and same-sex marriages. The legislation is in reaction to the logic used in overturning Roe v. Wade earlier this year.

Justice Clarence Thomas, in a concurring opinion, specifically mentioned reevaluating the rights to contraception and same-sex marriage. The basis for his argument also would challenge the right of interracial marriage, though he left that out. Thomas is Black, and his omission might have to do with his marriage to a white woman.

Those 1972 Tribune stories were written by reporter Nell Jean Boggs of the “women’s staff.” One story featured a Tulsa couple, a white woman and a Black man (called Jane and John Doe) who married after divorces.

“When the Does first married, neighbors and others threw garbage in the yard and generally caused disturbances that affected the family.”

The story detailed how they shared a love of jazz music and raised Jane Doe’s two white sons in an integrated north Tulsa home. When one son was grown and set to marry a white woman, the white minister who agreed to perform the service backed out once he found out the stepfather was Black. Another preacher was located to perform the vows.

“I told him, ‘This is your day, and we won’t let one segregationist preacher ruin it for you,’” John Doe said.

Approval of interracial marriage when the Tribune stories were published was at about 29%. It was five years after the Loving v. Virginia case, which determined that bans on interracial marriage violated the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the 14th Amendment. That’s the same legal basis protecting rights for same-sex marriage and contraception.

The Tribune stories quoted a statistic from the “Junior Review”: Of the 1.8 million marriages solemnified in the United States each year, about 8,000 were interracial. Of those, about 2,400 were between a Black person and white person.

The Pew Research Center found in 2015 that 17% of newlyweds had a spouse of a different race. More broadly, it reported that one in 10 married people had a spouse of a different race or ethnicity. That translates to about 11 million interracial marriages in the U.S.

Of the interracial marriages, the largest couplings are among white and Hispanic partners (42%), followed by white and Asian (15%), white and multiracial (12%), white and Black (11%), Hispanic and Black (5%), white and American Indian (3%), Hispanic and Asian (3%), and Hispanic and multiracial (3%).

A story in that 50-year-old series included comments from a Black Tulsa woman whose son married a white woman.

“’I love my son very much,’ she declared. She likes her white daughter-in-law also but was relieved when the couple moved to another Oklahoma town from Tulsa where they had suffered several indignities because of the interracial marriage,” the story states.

Several high-profile interracial couples had made headlines, including Black rock ’n’ roll icon Chubby Checker and former Miss World Catharina Lodders (who were married for 58 years) and white British journalist David Frost and Black American actress Diahann Carroll (it lasted only three years).

The Black Tulsa mother noted that those celebrities don’t get hassled in places like New York, Los Angeles or London. Facetiously, the woman said, “But our good Christian Bible Belt atmosphere here in Tulsa just isn’t ready for it.”

Religion has often been misused as a cover for discrimination, as was brought up in that Tribune series.

A white mother described the reactions others had when discovering her daughter was dating a Black man. She was told that a biracial child would be ostracized or “biologically inferior,” that an interracial couple would have a hard time finding housing or jobs, and that people of different backgrounds naturally have conflict.

“God never meant races to mix. If he had, he would not have made us different,” she was told, according to the story.

Those sentiments were as morally wrong then as they are now. But I’ve heard versions of those stereotypes and untruths in references to same-sex couples, from baseless concerns for children to abuse of biblical passages.

All this makes me wonder what we are doing today that will be viewed harshly 50 years from now.

Objection to the Respect for Marriage Act centers on same-sex marriage. Both of Oklahoma’s senators voted against the bill, with U.S. Sen. James Lankford speaking against it from the floor, citing religious liberties.

Gallup’s polling on same-sex marriage shows consistent growth in approval among Americans, increasing from 27% in 1996 to 71% this year.

It took nearly twice as long for interracial marriage to reach that level of approval.

Same-sex marriage became legal nationwide in 2015 with the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. The high court determined that LGBTQ+ people had a right to legal marriage with the person of their choice, regardless of gender.

Oklahoma had been issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples since Oct. 6, 2014. That’s when the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal of a lower court’s ruling that found Oklahoma’s ban on same-sex marriage to be unconstitutional.

The first LGBTQ+ couple known to obtain an Oklahoma marriage license were Tulsa World staffers Mary and Sharon Bishop-Baldwin (although Sharon had resigned from the World five months earlier). Many of us crammed in and around the courthouse that day to witness that history. It was a happy, joyful day.

In the six-month period before the 2015 Obergefell ruling, Gallup found that 7.9% of LGBTQ+ adults considered themselves married. In the first year after the ruling, about 9.6% of LGBTQ+ people tied the knot, creating about 491,000 marriages. The number of same-sex marriages in the U.S. has grown since then to about 750,000.

Same-sex marriages are still not common. Less than 1% of U.S. adults are in a same-sex marriage, compared to about 48% of Americans with an opposite-sex spouse. Among LGBTQ+ people, only about 10% are legally married.

Many government policies have been built around marriage status, most notably concerning taxes. If the government is going to be in the business of issuing licenses and crafting benefits around marriage, it shouldn’t discriminate.

Modern marriage is also about love. How can I not respect those fortunate enough to find it? The sky didn’t fall when the courts allowed for legal interracial and same-same marriage. Families become stronger when we expand the narrow definitions of love and marriage.

The Tribune series may be a half-century old, but the stories hold lessons, like love is love is love.",Q4
https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/dec/10/we-are-not-one-review-israel-us-politics-eric-alterman,We Are Not One review: assured history of Israel’s place in US politics,"The civil war divided America’s Christians along axes of geography and theology. These days, Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, soon to be prime minister again, have wrought a similar sorting. In the words of Eric Alterman, “Israel is a red state. US Jewry is blue.”

Alterman is a distinguished professor of English and journalism at the City University of New York. We Are Not One represents four decades of effort, patience and research. Sixty pages of endnotes undergird his arguments, some dating to his student days.

Alterman posits that closeness between the US and Israel has oscillated over time and that younger American Jews, particularly those outside Orthodox Judaism, are now distancing themselves from the Zionist experiment. He relies, in part, on polling by Pew Research.

Practically speaking, the divide may be more nuanced, with the latest shifts also reflecting a response to a rise in crime – and messaging about it. In the midterms, the Republican Lee Zeldin won 46% of Jewish voters in New York as he came close to beating the governor, Kathy Hochul. Donald Trump never surpassed 30% nationally. In 2020, he took 37% of New York’s Jewish vote.

In We Are Not One, Alterman observes how unsafe streets and racial tensions helped spawn neoconservatism. It is “impossible” to separate the movement’s “origins from the revulsions caused by constant news reports of inner-city riots … and broader societal dislocations”. Between 1968 and 1972, Richard Nixon’s share of the Jewish vote doubled from 17% to 35%.

One Saturday night in 1968, a crowd thronged the streets of Borough Park in Brooklyn, a predominately Jewish enclave, to cheer the vice-president, Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic presidential nominee. Over the next four years, “law and order” found purchase. To top it off, George McGovern, the Democratic nominee, made Israel supporters nervous.

The South Dakota senator’s message, “Come home America”, left them wondering if the US would be in Israel’s corner if war came again. Vietnam was a proxy for foreign policy anxieties. As a coda, Alterman recollects how Nixon nonetheless yearned to turn Jews into political foils and whipping boys. That 2016 Trump ad with a six-pointed star over a field of dollar bills? It had deep roots.

Alterman also recounts how Daniel Moynihan, a Democrat, used his position as Gerald Ford’s UN ambassador to reach the Senate in 1976. With support from neoconservatives, hawkish Jews and the New York Times, he beat Bella Abzug, a leftwing lion, in the primary. Then he beat James Buckley, the Republican incumbent.

Moynihan lauded Israel’s raid at Entebbe. In Alterman’s description, he appealed to “American Jews’ feelings of vulnerability and their pride and relief at Israel’s military prowess in kicking the asses” of Palestinian and German terrorists and “humiliating” Idi Amin, Uganda’s “evil dictator”.

Time passes. Things remain the same. In New York, transit crime is up more than 30%. Violence against Jews is a staple, according to the NYPD.

Meanwhile, on college campuses, in Alterman’s words, Israel is a “mini-America”, a useful target for faculty and students to vent against “rapaciousness on the part of the US and other western nations vis-a-vis the downtrodden of the world”.

The author quotes Benzion Netanyahu, the Israeli leader’s late father: “Jewish history is in large measure a history of holocausts.” Modern insecurities spring from ancient calamities.

Kanye West spews bile. Trump entertains him with Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist and Holocaust denier. Republicans quietly squirm. Trump’s Jewish supporters grapple with cognitive dissonance and emotional vertigo. Take Mort Klein, of the hard-right Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), who makes several appearances in We Are Not One.

Testifying before Congress, Klein accused the press of taking Trump’s comments on Charlottesville, where neo-Nazis marched in 2017, “completely out of context”. In 2018, after 11 worshippers were murdered at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Klein rode to the rescue again. At the ZOA dinner, he said it was “political blasphemy” to blame Trump.

Last month, ZOA gave Trump its highest honor. According to Klein, the ex-president was the “best friend Israel ever had in the White House”. Then Trump met West, now known as Ye, and Fuentes, twisting Klein into a human pretzel.

“Trump is not an antisemite,” he announced. “He loves Israel. He loves Jews. But he mainstreams, he legitimizes Jew hatred and Jew haters. And this scares me.”

Trump reportedly kept Hitler’s speeches by his bed. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck.

At a recent confab of Agudath Israel of America, an ultra-Orthodox group, Rabbi Dovid Zwiebel, its executive vice-president, condemned Trump: “Yesterday’s friend can be tomorrow’s greatest enemy.” Two years earlier, though, its members clearly backed Trump over Joe Biden. Borough Park was as deep red as Lafayette, Louisiana.

It all carries a whiff of deja vu. Alterman recounts how neoconservatives admonished America’s Jews against complaining of Israel’s alliance with Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson: “The Christian Zionists’ devotion to ‘Greater Israel’ earned them a pass from the neocons for their occasional outbursts of antisemitism.”

Trump’s Mar-a-Lago dinner created a similar bind. David Friedman, his bankruptcy lawyer and ambassador to Israel, tweeted: “To my friend Donald Trump, you are better than this … I urge you to throw those bums out, disavow them and relegate them to the dustbin of history where they belong.”

Trump was not amused. On Friday, he lashed out at “Jewish Leaders”. Friedman must learn patience. ZOA may wish to rescind its award.

Jason Greenblatt, a Trump Organization lawyer who moved to the White House, echoed Friedman for CNN. Days later, he spoke at a synagogue in Scarsdale, north of New York City. Greenblatt repeated the need for Trump to correct the record and urged those in attendance to politely speak up.

In the next breath, he lauded his one-time boss’s achievements and character. It sure is tough to quit Trump.",Q4

Michael Jerome Butler, 35, of Greenville, faces eight charges in the case: two counts of kidnapping, two counts of rape, two counts of sodomy and one count each of sexual torture and robbery. He allegedly abducted the victims from the parking lot of the Prattville Walgreens at the corner of East Main Street and Memorial Drive.

Butler was arrested about 48 hours later following a nationwide search. He faces charges in a home invasion in Atlanta and the killing of a woman near Birmingham.

The victims attended the hearing, sitting in the gallery. They could be seen wiping tears from their eyes several times through the hour-long proceeding. Butler sat in the jury box, with a spit guard tied over his head. He kept his head bowed during the proceeding and appeared to show no emotion.

There was an elevated law enforcement presence in the courtroom, including five Prattville Police Department SWAT officers who remained close to Butler.

District Judge Joy Booth ruled Butler be held without bond pending his trials in Autauga County.

Scott Baxley, the Prattville Police Department investigator in the case, was the only witness the prosecution called. He told Booth that Butler was allegedly armed with a revolver when he abducted the teens, forcing them into a Nissan car that was registered to his mother.

Butler allegedly drove the teens from Prattville first to Montgomery, then to Lowndes County where the sexual assaults occurred. He used the revolver as a foreign object in the sexual torture of one victim, Baxley said.

He continually threatened the girls’ lives, one time telling a victim he would shoot her in the head “and lick her brains off the window,” District Attorney C.J. Robinson told Booth. Before the sexual assaults Butler allegedly pointed the gun at the victims’ heads and asked if they wanted to perform sexual acts or die, Baxley said.

“This is every parent’s nightmare, everyone’s nightmare,” Robinson said. “It was a random act, we can find no connection between Butler and the victims. These two girls are here by the grace of God and their own fortitude in getting through this together.”

Butler drove the teens back to Prattville where he released them, Baxley said he first spoke with them at the Prattville Baptist Hospital emergency room that night.

An all out investigation began and the first break came with surveillance footage from a Montgomery gas station where the victims said Butler drove them. His image was captured on a recording inside the gas station, and Prattville investigators released the image on a state-wide lookout seeking information.

Authorities with the Greenville Police Department and the Butler County Sheriff’s Office identified the suspect as Butler. He has five felony convictions in Butler County, all theft related, dating back to 2006, Robinson told Booth.

Once they had his name and vehicle, investigators began tracking him by cellphone data and other means. He traveled to the Atlanta area, where he is a suspect in an armed home invasion, shooting, robbery and other crimes, Baxley told Booth. Butler was also tracked to St. Clair County where he allegedly kidnapped and shot a woman there. He is charged with murder in St. Clair County in connection to that fatal shooting, court records show. St. Clair law enforcement agencies arrested Butler after a short vehicle chase in Leeds.

Before the hearing, Booth appointed Richard Lively to represent Butler.

Lively questioned the constitutionality of Aniah’s Law.

“First of all, judge, it’s a brand new law,” he told Booth. “The law violates the defendant’s right against excessive bond as guaranteed in the Eighth Amendment. He can receive bond, even a high bond, but to hold him with no bond, I feel, is unconstitutional.”

Booth said she was handing down the no bond due to Butler being a threat to the public, and given the charges he is facing with such stiff penalties that he should be considered a flight risk.

Robinson told the court his office will seek a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole under the Habitual Felons Act if Butler is convicted of the Autauga County charges.

“What he faces in Georgia and St. Clair County is frankly not my concern,” Robinson told Booth. “My concern is these victims and delivering justice for them.”

Aniah’s Law was passed by voters in the general election in November. It makes it easier for judges to deny bail for suspects charged with violent felonies. Before then no bond could be handed down for people facing capital murder charges or who had been deemed a flight risk.

It is named for Aniah Blanchard, an Auburn college student who went missing in October of 2019. Her body was found about a month later in a wooded area of Macon County.

Ibraheem Yazeed was charged with murder in Blanchard's death. At the time Blanchard was abducted, Yazeed was free on bonds totaling $295,000 on charges of attempted murder, kidnapping, robbery and assault in an unrelated case.

Leaders across Florida, including Governor Ron DeSantis, also expressed frustration with the verdict.

""I think that if you have a death penalty at all, that is a case where you're massacring those students with premeditation and other disregard for basic humanity, you deserve the death penalty,"" he said during a press conference on an unrelated issue in Cape Coral.

DeSantis on Thursday also decried the lengthy legal process after the school massacre.

""You know, they used to do this, he would have been executed in six months. He’s guilty, everybody knew that from the beginning. And yet it takes years and years in this legal system. That is not serving the interest of victims,"" DeSantis, a Harvard-educated lawyer, said.

Charlie Crist, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, also disagreed with the jury's decision.

""There are crimes for which the only just penalty is death,"" Crist tweeted. ""The Parkland families and community deserved that degree of justice. I will continue to pray for healing for the families and every person impacted by this tragedy.""

Jared Moskowitz, who previously served as the director of Florida Division of Emergency Management and is now the Democratic nominee to represent Florida’s 23rd Congressional District, attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. He served in the state legislature immediately following the 2018 massacre.

""He should die 17 times!"" he tweeted.

Gov. Rick Scott, who was the governor at the time of the mass shooting, also disagreed with the decision, saying ""…many of us find it hard to understand how such brutal crimes could be met with anything but the most severe punishment allowed under our laws.""

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, who served on the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Safety Commission, addressed the verdict Thursday afternoon, blasting the jury's decision.

""Nothing that comes out of Broward County surprises me. If there's ever been anyone on the face of the Earth that deserved the death penalty, it was that evil, violent, murdering piece of trash that massacred those children,"" Judd said. ""There's never been a more cold, calculated, premeditated murder than that, and if you can't get the death penalty for that in Broward County, that's not a safe county to live in.""

Benjamin Thomas, the jury foreperson, told WFOR that three jurors ultimately voted against the death penalty, with one of them being a ""hard no"" on the decision and another two ultimately choosing to vote against it as well.

""It didn't go the way I would've liked or the way I voted but that's how the jury system works,"" Thomas said. ""I didn't vote that way so I'm not happy with how it turned out, but everybody has the right to decide for themselves. It is a moral decision on their own; some of the jurors just felt that way.""",Q4

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A man broke into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s home in San Francisco and severely beat her 82-year-old husband, Paul Pelosi, with a hammer early Friday while the Democratic lawmaker was in Washington.

Paul Pelosi had surgery to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands, and his doctors expect a full recovery, the speaker’s office said. In a letter to congressional colleagues Saturday night, Nancy Pelosi said her husband's condition “continues to improve.”

David DePape, 42, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, elder abuse and burglary, police said.

“This was not a random act. This was intentional. And it’s wrong,” San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said.

The violence was the latest jolt to an increasingly splintered political system that is riven with extremism.

A look at what is known about the attack and the suspect:

WHAT HAPPENED?

An intruder wielding a hammer smashed his way through a rear door into the Pelosi residence in San Francisco shortly before 2:30 a.m. Friday. The man confronted Paul Pelosi and shouted, “Where is Nancy,” according to a person familiar with the situation who was granted anonymity to discuss it.

Paul Pelosi called 911 himself and when police arrived they found him struggling with the assailant. The man managed to strike Pelosi at least once with the hammer before he was tackled by officers and arrested, police said.

Nancy Pelosi was in Washington at the time of the attack.

HOW’S PAUL PELOSI DOING?

He underwent surgery to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands, and his doctors expect a full recovery, the speaker’s office said Friday. Other than Nancy Pelosi's letter to colleagues, there were no updates on his condition Saturday.

Nancy Pelosi arrived in San Francisco late Friday. The couple has been married since 1963.

In her letter, the speaker thanked colleagues for their prayers and warm wishes. “Our children, our grandchildren and I are heartbroken and traumatized by the life-threatening attack on our Pop,” she wrote. “We are grateful for the quick response of law enforcement and emergency services, and for the life-saving medical care he is receiving.”

___

WHAT ARE INVESTIGATORS SAYING?

Scott, the San Francisco police chief, said the attack was not a random act. “This was intentional,” he said.

Police didn't immediately confirm a motive, but three people with knowledge of the investigation told The Associated Press that the assailant targeted Pelosi’s home.

The FBI and Capitol Police are also part of the joint investigation.

___

WHO IS THE SUSPECT?

DePape was expected to be charged next week with attempted homicide, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse and burglary. After his arrest, he was taken to a hospital, where he remained as of Friday evening.

DePape posted frequently on social media, often making racist and rambling comments that included questioning the results of the 2020 election, defending former President Donald Trump and echoing QAnon conspiracy theories.

A two-decade resident of the San Francisco Bay Area, he was known locally as a pro-nudity activist who had picketed naked at protests against laws requiring people to be clothed in public.

He grew up in Powell River, British Columbia, before following an older girlfriend to California. He has three children with two women. Stepfather Gene DePape said the suspect had lived with him in Canada until he was 14 and had been a quiet boy.

“He was reclusive,” said Gene DePape. “He was never violent.”

___

HAVE OTHER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEEN THREATENED?

It’s been almost two years since the riot at the U.S. Capitol, when Trump supporters broke into the building and hunted for Pelosi and other members of Congress. Since then, threats to lawmakers and their families have increased sharply.

The U.S. Capitol Police investigated almost 10,000 threats to members last year, more than twice the number from four years earlier.

Lawmakers have pressed for better security, especially for their families and their homes outside of Washington. Security officials have promised to pay for upgrades to certain security systems and an increased Capitol Police presence outside Washington. But the vast majority of members are mostly on their own.

The attack on Paul Pelosi happened when Nancy Pelosi was out of town, which meant there was less of a security presence in their home.",Q4

The application form asks young people to check a box identifying themselves as either ""(1) Asian, (2) Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, (3) Hispanic, (4) White, (5) African American or (6) Native American."" White Hispanics with ancestors from Spain are lumped in with Central American immigrants. The Black child of a Harvard-trained doctor or diplomat checks the same box as a Black applicant living in a homeless shelter. The Asian category absurdly covers 60% of the world's population, from China to Japan to India.

Applicants who mark Hispanic or African American win acceptance with test scores and grades far below what whites or Asians, on average, need to get in, according to data presented to the court.

Broad categories are appropriate for sorting zoo animals -- reptiles over here, mammals over there -- but it's no way to recognize the humanity and individual merit of college applicants.

On Monday, the Supreme Court justices grilled the Harvard and UNC attorneys. The questions indicate the Court is likely to outlaw using race to determine who is accepted.

Universities could still consider the achievements of applicants who convey in their personal essay or interviews that they have overcome hardships related to their race. Patrick Strawbridge, a lawyer for Students for Fair Admissions, which brought the lawsuits, explained what SFFA objects to is the consideration of ""race by itself.""

Harvard lawyer Seth Waxman objected that while race is sometimes the determining factor on who gets into Harvard, other times being ""an oboe player in a year in which the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra needs an oboe player"" will tip a student in. Chief Justice John Roberts instantly shot back, ""We did not fight a civil war about oboe players.""

The left objects that outlawing racial preferences will be yet another departure from precedent. Not true. The precedent is Grutter v. Bollinger, a 2003 ruling that upheld the use of race at the University of Michigan Law School. But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who wrote the Grutter opinion, anticipated that racial preferences would be temporary and unneeded in 25 years.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked the Harvard and UNC lawyers repeatedly, ""When is your sunset?"" They had no answer. They have no intention of ending racial preferences voluntarily.

U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, representing the Biden administration, cautioned that overturning racial preferences would send ""shock waves"" through every sector of society. That's actually good news, especially for employees in the corporate world who are frequently being told ""we already have too many white guys.""

Some 70 major companies, including Apple and Google, filed briefs supporting Harvard and UNC. A trade group representing human resource departments in 600 companies also filed a brief supporting racial preferences, quoting a McKinsey & Company report that the business case for ""diversity, equity, and inclusion "" is stronger than ever.

Not one company indicated support for colorblind admissions. The gap between the corporate world and what the American public wants is staggering. Corporate America's HR departments are pushing DEI, but most Americans, according to Pew Research, want people judged on their individual merits.

Justice Elena Kagan asked about preferential hiring to create a diverse police department or a diverse set of law clerks. She challenged the notion that ""it just doesn't matter if our institutions look like America.""

An attorney for SFFA replied that ""merit and your worth as a person"" are ""not correlated with your skin color."" Amen.

Another SFFA lawyer summed up the case: Racial classifications ""cause resentment by treating people differently based on something they can't change.""

President Joe Biden promised to unite the nation, but his racial favoritism has done the opposite. A Court ruling striking down racial preferences will help bring the nation together.

The ugly facts revealed about admissions at UNC and Harvard confirm what Roberts said long ago: ""It is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.""",Q4

New York Attorney General Letitia James has publicly declared her intention to take the former President to court in 2023. James filed a lengthy lawsuit against Trump and his children in September, accusing him of inflating his net worth by several billion dollars. As punishment, James is hoping to ban Trump from conducting business in the Empire State.

“Given the fact that this action involves allegations of an ongoing scheme and conspiracy to obtain millions of dollars through fraudulent activity, and that defendants repeatedly have sought to delay the conclusion of OAG’s investigation, it is imperative that this case proceed quickly,” investigator Kevin Wallace, per Business Insider.

Donald Trump has fired back at James and her legal team. During a recent radio interview, he referred to her a “disaster.”

“You look at this Letitia James. She’s a disaster,” Trump said during a recent appearance on WABC 770 AM’s Cast At Night.

“She spends years going after me … She said I maybe misrepresented to banks, which frankly, I didn’t….she goes after me on…banks that are fully paid. Totally satisfied. Happy. They got their money back…In the meantime, we have murderers walking down the street.”

PHOENIX — After eight years serving in the Arizona House of Representatives, Pima County Republican Rep. Mark Finchem is looking to take on a new challenge as Arizona’s next secretary of state.

Finchem, a former law enforcement officer, said he was built with a heart for service.

“My objective in this whole pursuit is to see to it that nobody has their thumb of influence on the scale of election justice,” Finchem told 12News.

The polarizing politician from Pima County says he decided to run for the office of secretary of state after the results of the 2020 election when former President Donald Trump lost to President Joe Biden.

Finchem, who falsely claimed the 2020 election was “rigged” and “robbed” from the American people, has made election security and election integrity the center of his campaign.

Finchem, who has a degree in six sigma process engineering from Grand Canyon University, said his background is to ask questions and find defects in a process, which he claimed happened in Arizona’s 2020 election.

Finchem said if elected as secretary of state he would shore up voter rolls, chain of custody issues with ballots, and conduct pre-check audits.

He said he would like to see ballots include a watermark for authenticity.

Since then, Finchem, a MAGA Republican and large supporter of Trump, has been vocal in the claims the election was stolen from Trump, without evidence.

He’s questioned the use of electronic machines in counting votes.

Many MAGA Republicans have claimed that electronic voting machines are capable of changing votes. No evidence has ever been produced to show it is possible.

Finchem, and Republican Gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake recently filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge to deny the use of machines to count votes in the upcoming November election, and to only count votes by hand.

A judge dismissed the lawsuit, saying there was nothing to prove the claims that there were problems with the machines.

Finchem has called for access to software in the machines.

“I want to open that thing up and allow us to inspect it. Allow the court to inspect it under a court order. Someone who is a disinterested third party,” he said.

Finchem has also raised questions about the legitimacy of mail-in ballots in Arizona.

Vote-by-mail has been widely available in Arizona since 1991.

Despite 80% of Arizonans, and even Finchem voting by mail. He said there are issues with chain of custody issues with ballots.

“Yes, mail-in balloting is popular here. In fact, something like 80%. In fact, I voted in 25, 26 elections by mail-in ballot, but what I have seen in the past two years I went to the polls for the primaries,” Finchem said.

“Despite attacks from my opponent, I am not interested in removing mail-in balloting. I can’t. It’s the law. I cannot make any laws. That is the job of the legislature. I am only here to enforce the ones we have,” Finchem said.

Finchem’s denial of the election has landed him under the political microscope.

He was subpoenaed by the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol as part of an investigation into a plan to send fake electors from Arizona to stop the certification of the election in Congress.

Finchem, who was at the Capitol on Jan. 6, said he did not enter the Capitol building.

With so many questions he says still unanswered after the 2020 election, would he accept the results of November’s election if he lost?

“As long as the votes have been cast within the law. If there are violations of law that would impact the outcome, then I would want to have our day in court if necessary. I reserve that right,"" he said.

Finchem said if he's victorious on Nov. 8, he would be willing to reach across the aisle, no matter the party.

“Frankly as Secretary of State, the moment I’m elected I have to take off my partisan hat. It’s got to come off,” he says.

Whoever wins this race will have an important job before them.

Not only will they be required to monitor and uphold Arizona’s election laws, but because Arizona does not have a lieutenant governor, the secretary of state is also second behind the governor in the Arizona line of succession.

https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/12/supreme-court-elections-legislature-trump-north-carolina.html,The Supreme Court’s Most Conservative Justices Got Outplayed on Wednesday,"After three hours of oral arguments at the Supreme Court on Wednesday, only one thing is certain: If the justices want to blow up federal elections, they will have nothing to hide behind—not history, not logic, and certainly not the Constitution. The three lawyers defending democracy methodically dismantled the “independent state legislature” theory from every conceivable angle, debunking each myth, misreading, and misrepresentation deployed to prop it up. They bested the conservative justices who tried to corner them, identifying faulty reasoning and bogus history with devastating precision.

Those of us who’ve been ringing the alarm over this dangerous theory—and who’ve been disgusted by the campaign to drag it from the far-right fringe all the way to the Supreme Court—can take solace knowing that these capable lawyers exposed it as an utter fraud. This idea was at the center of Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, so it was a relief to hear five justices sound deeply skeptical that it has any basis in the Constitution. It is far too early to celebrate the demise of the independent state legislature theory, since four justices have already endorsed it. But the skepticism it faced at arguments suggests that democracy has a fighting chance of survival.

If Wednesday’s case, Moore v. Harper, is new to you, prepare to be startled by how ridiculous it is. The petitioners are Republican leaders of the North Carolina Legislature. They are angry that the North Carolina Supreme Court struck down the congressional map that they drew after the 2020 census—which was, objectively, an extreme partisan gerrymander. The court found that the map violated various provisions of the North Carolina Constitution, including a guarantee that “all elections shall be free.” There was nothing unusual about this decision: It is a bedrock principle of federalism that state courts have final authority over the meaning of state constitutions. Other courts, including the Supreme Courts of Florida and Pennsylvania, issued similar decisions invalidating congressional districts, and SCOTUS did not get involved.

But North Carolina Republicans decided to use this case to achieve a broader GOP ambition: the revival of a long-discredited doctrine known as the independent state legislature theory, or ISLT. This theory rests on the Constitution’s elections clause, which says the “times, places, and manner” of federal elections “shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.” It posits that this clause frees the state legislature from restraints imposed by the state constitution when regulating federal elections. Specifically, it would prevent state courts from enforcing those restraints when the legislature passes a law that violates them. The usual checks and balances of state lawmaking do not apply, the ISLT claims, because the U.S. Constitution gives power over the “manner” of these elections to the state legislature exclusively.

That’s the argument that the Supreme Court considered, and rejected, in Bush v. Gore. (A young Bush lawyer named Brett Kavanaugh was especially enamored of it.) It’s the argument that Trump deployed when he tried to nullify millions of votes in 2020. And it’s the argument that Ginni Thomas, wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, relied upon when lobbying state legislators to appoint “alternate electors” who would support Trump. And to be fair, it has some superficial appeal: Its proponents like to say that “legislature means legislature,” and that’s the end of it.

But it’s really not, for at least four reasons. First, when the Constitution was written, in 1787, legislature meant more than the specific body of elected representatives who pass laws. The word encompasses the entire power that makes laws—which is why, for instance, a governor can veto a congressional map. Second, even if legislature meant a specific political body, there’s no indication that the Framers intended to cut out the rest of state government, letting representatives flout all the usual rules of lawmaking. State legislatures have always been understood as creatures of their state constitutions, with no special power to bypass the charter that created them. Third, since the start of the republic, state courts have imposed limits on election laws passed by the legislature—a tradition that casts doubt on the hypothesis that the elections clause contains some secret, sweeping limit on their authority. Fourth, even if these three propositions are dead wrong, there’s still no clear, consistent standards that federal courts could use to determine when state courts misinterpret state election law. If the Supreme Court did adopt the ISLT, it would be flooded with disputes over election procedures, with no principled test to decide each case.

The justices pressed these issues through arguments on Wednesday. But before turning to them, it’s worth reiterating the cross-ideological consensus that the ISLT is bunk. A number of conservative legal luminaries filed briefs in Moore v. Harper opposing it, including Thomas Griffith, a former judge appointed by George W. Bush; J. Michael Luttig, a former judge appointed by George H.W. Bush; Steven Calabresi, a co-founder of the Federalist Society; Ben Ginsberg, a renowned GOP election lawyer; and Charles Fried, Ronald Reagan’s solicitor general. In an unprecedented move, the chief justices of all 50 states’ Supreme Courts urged SCOTUS not to adopt the theory for fear of confusion and mayhem at every level of the judiciary.

This outpouring of opposition can be attributed, in part, to Trump’s effort to use the ISLT in service of a coup. Reasonable Republicans recognize a reality described by Neal Katyal, who argued that “the blast radius” from ISLT “would sow elections chaos,” “invalidating 50 different state constitutions” and countless statutes empowering state courts to regulate elections. Katyal was in top form on Wednesday, playing both advocate and historian. The ISLT, he explained, is refuted by 233 years of history, “rejected by the Articles of Confederation, rejected by the early state constitutions, rejected by the founding practice,” and repudiated by the Supreme Court’s precedents. To accept the theory, he told the justices, “you’d have to ignore the text, history, and structure of our federal Constitution as well as nearly every state constitution today.”

Barrett sounded audibly skeptical throughout Wednesday’s arguments.

Katyal faced intense pushback from Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Samuel Alito, three fanatical believers in the ISLT, but he did not yield. He corrected Gorsuch’s bad history when the justice accused him of defending Virginia’s three-fifths clause. (“It’s a nice smear,” Katyal quipped.) He pushed back hard against Alito’s efforts to malign the North Carolina Supreme Court as an out-of-control partisan usurper, explaining that it sought to impose only “ordinary checks and balances.” And he soothed Justice Brett Kavanaugh by assuring him that there could be some “federal judicial review” here, just under a “sky-high standard” of deference to state courts.

Don Verrilli, also opposing the ISLT, did a commendable job conveying the ahistorical nature of the doctrine. He explained that the Founders’ fear of state legislatures’ manipulating elections could be traced back to the English bill of rights, “which was about the manipulation of electoral processes so that the Parliament would be in the king’s pocket, essentially.” This originalist argument infuriated Alito, who asked sarcastically if “anybody ever thought that the English bill of rights had anything to do with” partisan gerrymandering. (Not how originalism works!) Alito continued to slander the North Carolina Supreme Court by mischaracterizing its precedents, but Verrilli deftly corrected his mistakes. You could actually hear Alito rhythmically thumping the bench, which he tends to do when he tries and fails to pin down counsel.

Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar then tied up loose ends, mostly reassuring Chief Justice John Roberts that SCOTUS could reject the ISLT without relinquishing all power over state election disputes. By the time Prelogar approached the podium, the arguments were pointing toward a rough consensus: In rare, extreme cases, a state Supreme Court might misinterpret an election law so egregiously, so indefensibly, that SCOTUS could intervene. In most situations, though, state courts still get final say over the manner of federal elections.

The real debate is exactly how much deference SCOTUS should give to state courts: Should the deference be “sky high”? “Incredibly high”? Limited to cases when state courts jettison “reasonable interpretive principles” or “impermissibly distort, beyond any fair reading, the state law”? The answer matters a great deal, because it will mean the difference between maintaining a judicial check on state legislatures and handing legislators the power to rig elections.

In the end, Moore v. Harper probably comes down to Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh have all endorsed the ISLT in the past. Roberts, along with Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, clearly has no desire to revive it. So Moore is in Barrett’s hands, and it serves as the ultimate test of her self-proclaimed originalism.

So it was noteworthy that Barrett sounded audibly skeptical throughout Wednesday’s arguments. She was pretty tough on David Thompson, who represented North Carolina’s GOP legislative leaders, suggesting that his “formalistic test” was an unworkable stab at “trying to deal with our precedent,” which cut against him. Thompson tried to draw a line between “substantive and procedural,” but Barrett wasn’t buying it: “As a former civil procedure teacher, I can tell you that is a hard line to draw and a hard line to teach students in that context as well.” She also pointedly noted that Thompson’s standards for implementing the ISLT were not “more manageable” than the North Carolina Supreme Court’s standards for measuring gerrymanders. It was a polite way of calling Thompson a hypocrite.

Advertisement

Barrett’s questions for Katyal, Verrilli, and Prelogar were much more sympathetic. The justice essentially asked Katyal how the court should write a decision rejecting the ISLT. And she strongly implied to Verrilli that SCOTUS did not even have jurisdiction to hear the case. Overall, Barrett sounded eager to end Moore v. Harper with a whimper.

Which is what any honest originalist would be obligated to do. Scholars of American legal history, particularly in the founding era, have lined up in this case to explain why the ISLT is totally foreign to the laws and traditions of this nation. They have presented overwhelming evidence to support their position, evidence that is not remotely countered by the other side. There are so many political factors in this case. It is haunted by the ghosts of Bush v. Gore and Trump’s coup—both confirmation that the ISLT can be manipulated for scurrilous ends. But the promise of originalism is that it lets judges cut through these extralegal considerations and cling to the original public meaning of the Constitution. Moore v. Harper is one of the rare cases in which that meaning is crystal clear. If Barrett doesn’t let politics interfere, she can turn this awful case into originalism’s shining moment.",Q4

“Gov. Greg Abbott bans TikTok on state phones and computers, citing cybersecurity risks” was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.

Gov. Greg Abbott banned the social media platform TikTok from government-issued cellphones and computers on Wednesday, becoming the latest GOP governor to target the video-sharing app over cybersecurity fears.

Abbott cited concerns that TikTok posed a threat to state information given that the app is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance Ltd. Last week, FBI Director Chris Wray expressed worry that the Chinese government could use the app’s recommendation algorithm to manipulate content or users. He warned that the Chinese government doesn’t share the United States’ values and said “that should concern us.”

The video-sharing app, which has popularized dance trends and inspired viral challenges, had almost 87 million users in the U.S. in 2021. The federal government has warned of TikTok’s security risks for years. In 2020, then-President Donald Trump threatened to ban the app.

Republican governors in South Dakota, South Carolina and Maryland have banned TikTok from government-issued devices. Republicans in Wisconsin petitioned their Democratic governor to do the same.

In letters to Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, House Speaker Dade Phelan and state agency leaders, Abbott said banning TikTok from government-issued cellphones, laptops, tablets and desktop computers would protect sensitive information and critical infrastructure from the Chinese government.

“TikTok harvests vast amounts of data from its users’ devices—including when, where, and how they conduct Internet activity—and offers this trove of potentially sensitive information to the Chinese government,” Abbott’s letter read.

Abbott acknowledged that TikTok has said its data is stored in the U.S., but he expressed concern that the Chinese government could use the app to surveil American citizens.

The governor also directed the Department of Public Safety and the Department of Information Resources to develop a plan to address the use of TikTok on the personal devices of government employees. One area of focus Abbott mentioned included network-based restrictions that would prevent access to TikTok while on agency property.

Abbott left some room for flexibility in the social media ban, allowing state agency leaders to use TikTok for law-enforcement investigations and “other legitimate uses.”

On Wednesday, Indiana’s attorney general sued TikTok, alleging the company deceived users about how China can access their data, according to The New York Times. The lawsuit also said the app exposed minors to mature content.

Earlier this year, the Austin Business Journal reported that TikTok leased over 125,000 square feet of office space in Austin.

Christopher Francisquini, 31, was apprehended at a Waterbury bus stop on Friday afternoon after a citizen recognized him from news coverage and called authorities.

Francisquini is accused of killing his infant daughter, Camilla, on November 18 in his home in Naugatuck.

He was charged with murder with special circumstances and risk of injury to a minor, and slapped with $5million bond.

Francisquini has a long rap sheet, with convictions for assault, carjacking, and other crimes to his name. He was on parole for a 2012 assault charge when he allegedly murdered his daughter, and cut off his GPS ankle bracelet before fleeing, according to the New York Daily News.

Police said Francisquini choked Camila, then stabbed and dismembered her.

After the murder, investigators say he got into a fight with her mother - who was unaware Camila was dead - then destroyed her cellphone, cut his parole GPS tracker from his ankle, then fled in a 2006 Chevy Impala.

A family member later found Camila's body. Her death was ruled as being caused by neck compressions and stab wounds.

The car Francisquini fled in was found abandoned off Interstate 91.

Dramatic footage from the arrest showed a legion of officers surrounding Francisquini as he say at a bus stop at about 3pm last Friday

United States Attorney Jacqueline C. Romero announced the sentence for 39-year-old Eduardo Castelan-Prado of Leonia, New Jersey and 32-year-old Jose Ochoa of Moreno Valley, California.

The duo was sentenced to 40 years in prison with an additional five years of supervised release after being convicted on kidnapping and conspiracy to commit kidnapping charges in June.

Authorities say the pair and a third co-conspirator kidnapped a 17-year-old from the parking lot of a Philadelphia restaurant where he worked on June 14, 2021.

According to officials, the group took the teen to an apartment complex in New Jersey, where they held him at gunpoint and made ransom demands asking for $500,000 from the teen's parents.

The Philadelphia Police Department and FBI tracked the phone calls to the location of the apartment complex, locating the teen on June 16, 2021, and arresting the kidnappers.

The third co-conspirator was fatally shot by federal agents when they were found. The circumstances around the fatal shooting are unclear.

""Ochoa and Castelan-Prado grabbed a teenage boy off the street to use as a human bargaining chip,"" said Jacqueline Maguire, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Philadelphia Division. ""They sought to extort his parents, demanding half a million dollars for their child’s survival and safe return. Fortunately, this despicable ploy for money was disrupted and the victim was recovered by the FBI and our partners.""

BARRON COUNTY, Wis. — Earlier this week a 14-year-old girl died following a rollover crash near Cameron, Wisconsin on Monday night.

Thursday morning, the Barron County Sheriff's Department said that another girl, a 15-year-old, died at Regions Hospital late on Wednesday night.

The 15-year-old who died Wednesday has been identified by relatives as 15-year-old Winter Brouillard.

Family and friends identified the 14-year-old as Evah Garcia.

""Evah was so loving, and she loved everybody. And she just wanted everybody to have a friend,"" family friend Sam Watry said. ""It's just a nightmare that you hope you can wake up from, but you can't.""

Separate fundraisers have been created on Facebook for the families of both Evah and Winter.

One other 14-year-old girl is still in the hospital as of Thursday morning. Her current condition is unknown, but as of Wednesday afternoon she was at Marshfield in stable condition being treated for a serious arm injury.

The crash happened just after 7 p.m. on Monday, according to officials. Multiple departments responded to the accident, including Barron County Sheriff's Department, Cameron police and fire departments, Wisconsin State Patrol and two Life Link helicopters.

Officials said that a 16-year-old boy was driving at a high rate of speed when he lost control of the vehicle, causing it to roll several times. Two 14-year-olds and one 15-year-old girl were injured, and all three were taken to the hospital.

The 16-year-old driver had minor injuries from the crash, and officials said he was treated on the scene. The Barron County Sheriff's Office said the teenage driver was taken into custody Monday on charges of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of a controlled substance and causing injury, although that is now expected to be upgraded to two counts of ""causing death.""

He was being held in the Eau Claire Secure Detention Facility.

""It's tragic. It's unexplainable,"" Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald said in an interview with KARE 11. ""It's hard to explain to kids.""

With the 16-year-old suspect awaiting a hearing, Fitzgerald said it's a chance to raise awareness about the dangers of driving under the influence.

""Really just talking to your kids about alcohol and drugs. This is a real-life situation, and choices that kids make have consequences,"" Fitzgerald said. ""We will use this as an example for other kids to stop this. I know that's what the two parents want who have lost their loved ones. They want something good to come out of it.""

At the crash scene in rural Cameron, friends continued to drop by with flowers and other items on Thursday. Andrew Clements came with his son, Jenson, who went to Rice Lake High School with the two teens killed.

""Just puts goosebumps throughout the whole body. Just like, wow. This actually happened?"" Andrew Clements said. ""Parents won't be able to see their daughters graduate, [or] walk them down the aisles for their wedding – it's all taken away, sadly.""

In a message to families and staff, Rice Lake School District Administrator Randy Drost confirmed that all of the teenagers involved in the crash were current or former students.

The school said the 14-year-old girl that was killed was a current student at Rice Lake High School.

""This is a truly devastating time for our entire community. Please know that pupil services staff members are available to meet with students and staff now and in the coming days. Please do not hesitate to reach out if your child needs assistance dealing with this terrible situation. You may set up an appointment with a pupil services staff member by calling the school office where your child attends,"" Drost said in the message.

https://thebeatofthecapital.com/2022/10/11/state-gop-leaders-boast-banning-critical-race-theory-experts-say-they-didnt/,State GOP leaders boast banning critical race theory. Experts say they didn’t,"Mississippi lawmakers spent more than seven hours in early 2022 debating a bill that they said would ban the teaching of critical race theory. They passed it after brushing off the emotional objections of every Black lawmaker and the fact that no state K-12 classroom taught the academic theory.

On the campaign trail and during recent speaking events, several Republican officials have since boasted their hard work and focus on the issue.

But the recently updated Mississippi Code, the state’s book of laws which reflect bills passed during the 2022 legislative session and will soon be distributed across the state, does not include the term “critical race theory” — or even language banning its teaching, experts say.

The new law’s language reads no university, community college or public school “shall direct or otherwise compel students to personally affirm” that “any sex, race, ethnicity, religion or national origin is inherently superior or inferior or that individuals should be adversely treated on the basis of their sex, ethnicity, religion or national origin.”

Gov. Tate Reeves, Speaker Philip Gunn and others have touted that Senate Bill 2113, passed during the 2022 session, prohibits the teaching of critical race theory. The bill created a new section of law at 37-13-2 in the legal code. A general index for the legal code does say, “Critical race theory, prohibition,” and then cites the code section. But the code section itself does not use the term “critical race theory.”

“This law does not prohibit critical race theory, and courts generally are not looking to the index to interpret a statute,” said Yvette Theresa Butler, a professor at the University of Mississippi School of Law and the only person in the state who focuses an entire class on critical race theory.

At the Neshoba County Fair earlier this year, Reeves proclaimed to the generally conservative crowd, “Here in Mississippi we are leading the way and we are driving the conservative movement. We have banned critical race theory, and we have banned vaccine mandates.”

In response to questions about critical race theory not being in the code, Cory Custer, the governor’s deputy chief of staff sent a statement: “Mississippi Today has consistently missed the point on this issue. You’ve been so focused on the label ‘critical race theory,’ that you’ve totally failed to understand that the legislation prohibits teaching the core tenets of this radical indoctrination. It’s almost like you have blinders on. Passing legislation that simply states critical race theory is banned isn’t enough.

“This legislation goes beyond labels and targets the discriminatory teaching that is the foundation of critical race theory – that students are inherently superior or inferior because of their sex, race, ethnicity, religion or national origin.”

But Butler said the language of the controversial law “actually prohibits the exact opposite of what CRT explores. CRT is just another theoretical method that is used to explore the law’s role in perpetuating and remedying inequality.”

“CRT explores the ways the law has been and is still used (even if written in a neutral – non-discriminatory – manner) to perpetuate racial inequality,” Butler said. “Consequently, it is factually inaccurate to say that anyone teaching CRT directs or compels students to adopt a belief that any race (sex, religion, etc.) is inherently superior or inferior.”

Critical race theory has generally been taught as a graduate level class on the university level and is designed to explore the impact of race on various aspects of society. When the bill was being debated earlier this year, state Department of Education officials said no public kindergarten through 12th grade school in the state was offering critical race theory classes.

A critical race theory class will again be offered at the Ole Miss Law School in the 2023 spring semester, Butler said.

Every African American member of the Legislature opposed passage of the bill during the 2022 session. In the Senate, all 14 African Americans walked out before the final vote in an unprecedented move.

While many Black legislators argued that the language of the bill is meaningless, they still voted against it saying they feared that it could make some educators afraid to teach the true history of the state.

Democratic state Rep. Robert Johnson of Natchez, the House minority leader and longtime attorney, agrees with Butler’s interpretation of the law. The law threatens to cut off funding to any school that violates its conditions, though Johnson said there is no enforcement mechanism in the proposal.

“This law does not prohibit the teaching of critical race theory,” Johnson said. “It does not prevent teachers who are brave and want to challenge their students from doing so.”

The bill lawmakers passed earlier this year did not include the term “critical race theory” in its text. The only mention was at the bottom of the final page of the bill where in nondescript type it reads “ST: Critical Race Theory: prohibit.” The Mississippi Legislature’s website also displays what is known as the short title of the bill “Critical Race Theory, prohibit” if the bill is called up.

Various right wing groups and politicians have argued that critical race theory attempts to create racial strife and attempts to place undue burdens on young white children. Butler said that is not the case.

“Unfortunately, I’ve had many students in my Civil Rights class at the law school who are behind,” Butler said. “They received very limited formal education (as did I) about the antebellum era, the causes of the civil war and secession, the reconstruction era, and the civil rights movement. A civil rights class in law school is meant to discuss civil rights statutes and case law and how to use them to address legal injustices.

“While some civil rights history is covered in law school, it is not a substitute for a history class. I am concerned about what the last two years of messaging will do to students’ understanding of, not only history, but the valiant struggle by advocates of many races, sexes, genders, and religions to strengthen our conceptions of democracy, liberty, and equal protection.”

An explosion from the Chicago Fire fall finale left firefighters Stella Kidd and Sam Carver in peril, along with Detective Pryma and one of the bomb technicians.

We also saw the return of villain Emma Jacobs, who is the former paramedic that used to work with Violet Mikami at Firehouse 51. Emma had stepped in when Sylvie Brett traveled to Portland for some time with Matt Casey.

Then there are the not-so-subtle hints that Christopher Herrmann might want to retire, that Mouch is ready to sacrifice himself as the oldest member of the crew, and that the four members of the Rescue team constantly put themselves in harm’s way.

Chicago Fire is no stranger to killing off characters, either, which was displayed when Chief Evan Hawkins died a few episodes into Season 11. It showcased that nobody is really safe on the show.

Moving forward, the concern that some One Chicago fans are sharing online is justified, but it’s never easy to predict which character might fall next.

Who are the most likely characters to die on Chicago Fire?

It may be cheating, but we are going to go with several of the supporting characters as the most likely people to perish as Chicago Fire Season 11 continues. It would be pretty easy for the writers to kill Pryma in that explosion.

Likewise, Emma has been set up in a long-term villain storyline, so her character might start creating waves before ultimately perishing due to a situation she causes herself later this season.

Carver is also a candidate for a character that could die on Chicago Fire, but it sure seems like he has more backstory to reveal about his past with Stella Kidd. And if that backstory needs explaining, then Stella has to survive that explosion as well.

More to come on Chicago Fire Season 11

The Chicago Fire winter premiere synopsis has already been revealed, and it suggests that there will be a lot of drama in the aftermath of the fall finale explosion.

Meanwhile, we predicted whether Chicago Fire will be renewed or not, as NBC hasn’t pulled the trigger yet on giving the writers a Season 12 to work with.

But we certainly need all three shows to come back if the producers are going to finally give us another true One Chicago crossover event.

CONCORD, N.H. - A man charged with shooting a New Hampshire couple to death on a hiking trail in April had spent months living in nearby woods but disappeared after lying to police just before the bodies were discovered, according to court documents released Thursday.

The New Hampshire State Police affidavit was released by a judge in Vermont after Logan Clegg, 26, waived extradition and agreed to return to New Hampshire to face second-degree murder charges.

The document doesn't include a possible motive for the deaths of Stephen and Djeswende Reid, whose bodies were found April 21, three days after they left their Concord apartment complex to go for a walk. But it outlines what led investigators to Clegg, including store surveillance video, credit card records and cell phone data.

Stephen Reid and Djeswende Reid New Hampshire Attorney General

According to the affidavit, police investigating the couple's disappearance met a man living in the woods who identified himself as ""Arthur Kelly"" on April 20. Two days later, his campsite was abandoned but police found spent shell casings similar to those found at the crime scene.

Later, a woman came forward to say she had been walking her dog on April 18 when the Reids passed her on the trail. Minutes later, she heard gunshots, and she later saw a young man carrying a shopping bag looking into the woods toward where the bodies were found.

Several other residents told police they had seen a young homeless man in the area multiple times between November 2021 and April 2022, and surveillance footage showed someone matching their descriptions purchasing propane tanks and groceries at area stores.

Police didn't have a name until September, when a bank provided information about purchases the individual made using credit or debit cards. That led to an online retailer of dietary supplements, which identified the buyer as Clegg.

A booking photo of Clegg from a 2020 burglary arrest in Utah matched the ""Arthur Kelly"" police had spoken to in Concord, the affidavit states. A manager at a McDonald's in Concord also confirmed that she had employed Clegg from November 2021 to February 2022.

Police closed in on Clegg this month after learning that he had booked a one-way ticket to Germany for Oct. 14. They used the phone number he provided in purchasing the ticket to track him down in Burlington, Vermont on Oct. 12.

According to the affidavit, Clegg told police he had lived in Concord and worked at McDonald's but denied living in a tent, using the alias Arthur Kelly, having any interaction with police, possessing a gun or being involved in the Reids' deaths.

During his Vermont court appearance, Clegg answered questions from Superior Court Judge Mary Morrissey about whether he understood what he was doing when he agreed to return to face charges in New Hampshire. His attorney asked about the prosecution's request to seal the affidavit, but the judge said there was no legal authority to do so.

At a news conference in Concord, New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella said investigators have no information that suggests anyone other than Clegg was involved in the deaths. He otherwise declined to provide other information, including anything about a possible motive for the crime or whether Clegg had any connection to the couple.

""Mr. Clegg's arrest is a significant step in this case, but it's only one step,"" he said. ""There is a long way to go in this case.""

He and Concord Police Chief Bradley Osgood urged the public to continue coming forward with any information or tips.

""Six months ago, this senseless tragedy became our number one priority. It still remains our highest priority today,"" Osgood said. ""We hope that today will allow for a sense of healing for the community and the Reid family.""

Family members issued a statement thanking authorities for their work in identifying and arresting a suspect, as well as those who provided information and donated money to a reward hotline.

We can be brutal to our enemies inside and out, but fair to law abiding Arabs in pre-1967 Israel and Judea and Samaria..

We can play hardball with Ukraine, who murdered over a million Jews in the Holocaust. Even after their atrocities, we still gave them humanitarian aid – only to watch them vote for prosecuting us in the UN. We can tell these bastards they’re on their own.

We can build up our own defense industry. We can make our own home-grown arsenal so the American military can’t neuter us in the middle of a war like Obama did in 2014.

We can enact Jewish public sphere laws. We can ban all nonessential public sphere activity on Shabbat and Yom Tov. We can enact a blanket ban on all non-Kosher meat throughout the entire Land (Think halal in Jordan).

Paint was splattered over the face of Floyd who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020, sparking a nationwide reckoning on racial injustice and police brutality.

Milwaukee was one of many cities across the country that saw crowds come out, day-after-day, to protest Floyd’s murder. This mural was completed in June 2020, according to local news outlet Urban Milwaukee.

Dom Whitehurst, one of the original painters who helped organize the mural, told ABC WISN-12 that artists plan on repainting it and have discussed installing cameras in the area.

“Initially, I was like, ‘that’s horrible.’ More than likely, race related,” Whitehurst told the local news station. “It’s kind of sad that you have to do that for something so beautiful. This is supposed to be a peaceful representation of the community coming together.”

It’s not the first time a memorial created in honor of racial justice has been vandalized, with similar incidents occurring in New York, California, Michigan and more.

https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-12-06/twitter-severance-employee-lawsuits,Outgoing Twitter employees prepare for legal campaign against world’s richest man,"In the wake of the ultimatum Elon Musk issued in mid-November to the remaining team at Twitter to commit to a “hardcore” culture or leave, several former employees are pursuing legal action against him.

For months, as the will-they, won’t-they acquisition drama between Elon Musk and Twitter dragged on , Helen-Sage Lee held firm in her belief that the social media company was a workplace worth fighting for.

“We all believed in the product so much that most of us decided to stay to see it through,” Lee, who worked on the platform’s account integrity team, said of the purchase and the job insecurity it introduced for employees. “And I felt assured in doing so because of the severance that HR and legal promised in May, and again in October.”

Yet that assurance was misplaced, Lee now alleges. With the help of Calabasas-based attorney Lisa Bloom, Lee has filed an arbitration claim against Musk — the richest man in the world by some counts — for not following through on financial obligations she contends Twitter’s newest chief executive now holds.

It’s one of several such legal actions brewing in the wake of the billionaire’s chaotic and layoff-intensive tech takeover, which, amid a sectorwide downturn , has left many outgoing Twitter staffers scrambling for money, employment and a sense of closure.

On Nov. 3, only days after his purchase closed , Musk made good on rumors of mass layoffs with a companywide email saying that job cuts were coming. That night, Lee anxiously watched as co-workers flooded Twitter’s online workplace with saluting emojis and blue hearts.

Business Elon Musk’s ultimatum leaves Twitter in chaos and employees in the dark Elon Musk offered employees a deal: Commit to a new “hardcore” Twitter or leave with three months’ severance. For the many who opted to leave, questions remain about what will happen next.

And then it was Lee’s turn to go. Her laptop shut down at 9 p.m., she said, and her company access was revoked: “This was when I felt truly alone.”

Yet perhaps the toughest blow of all came a day later when, on Nov. 4, the company sent out more details about what the layoffs would look like.

“We received information that the severance package we were expected to receive in the coming week would be far less than what was initially promised to us prior to the acquisition,” Lee said during a Monday morning news conference hosted by Bloom, her attorney. “The severance package was a constant in a turbulent time that we relied on, and many of us are ready to take legal action.”

“I’m here today because I want to keep Twitter accountable,” she added.

Musk has claimed repeatedly that those he laid off will receive three months of severance pay. But the terms of his deal to purchase Twitter obligate him to provide a severance package “no less favorable” than the one promised by its prior leadership, which is the basis for the arbitration claim Lee and Bloom are now bringing forward.

The pre-acquisition package offered at least two months’ worth of severance pay as well as prorated performance bonuses, extended visa support, money for healthcare continuation and the cash value of equity that would vest within three months, according to laid-off employees as well as company documents reviewed by The Times.

Internal emails indicate that those who got laid off are now stuck in a limbo of “non-active” work, wherein they remain nominally employed — and keep getting paid — for a few months, but don’t actually work for the company. There’s been confusion among these employees as to whether the pay they’re currently getting is their severance or a normal wage. (It’s not uncommon for companies to offer two months’ worth of severance pay in order to get through the mandatory 60-day waiting period required amid large-scale layoffs under the federal WARN Act.)

“Twitter employees like [Lee] were told in writing by HR or legal that after the acquisition they would get the same severance benefits that Twitter employees got before the acquisition,” Bloom said. “That is an enforceable promise” — and, she added, one that Musk has since broken.

“They’re being paid until January 4, [but] there’s a complete lack of clarity as to whether if they get another job during this time period they will continue to get that pay,” explained Bloom, who has set her sights on tech malfeasance in the past . “The severance that was promised previously also entitles them to their prorated bonuses and to their stock vesting up to three months after their last day. … That’s what they’re being deprived of.”

Outgoing employees say the company has been inordinately slow to provide information about how the payout process will work, and confusion reigns about the ultimate package the company will give people. Employees on work visas or those who were on parental leave when they got laid off have even more questions.

Two more laid-off employees, Amir Shevat and Adrian Trejo Nuñez, also spoke at Bloom’s conference; both are pursuing their own arbitration claims against Musk. (Most Twitter employees waived their right to pursue a class-action suit when they were on-boarded by the company, Bloom said, thus requiring the pursuit of individual arbitration claims.)

“The way Elon Musk executed the layoffs was really inhumane,” said Shevat, who was the head of product for Twitter’s developer platform.

Nuñez, who was a senior software engineer, added: “I came forward to help myself and my former tweeps” — or Twitter employees — “receive our severance that was outlined in the agreement, which has since changed.”

Bloom said she has other clients too, and is actively soliciting more laid-off Twitter employees to join her.

“My law firm represents a large group of Twitter workers and contractors, and we will continue to file these cases, one by one, bombarding Twitter with claims,” she said. “We are hitting Twitter and Elon with every applicable claim, from promissory estoppel, to breach of contract, to breach of their implied agreement, to violation of the WARN Act, to civil rights violations.”

Bloom isn’t the only one moving against Musk.

On Thursday, attorney Akiva Cohen sent a letter to the tech mogul threatening a legal campaign on behalf of his own cohort of laid-off Twitter employees.

“If you don’t unequivocally confirm by Wednesday, December 7, that you intend to provide our clients with the full severance Twitter promised them, we will commence an arbitration campaign on their behalf,” Cohen wrote.

As with Bloom’s clients, Cohen said he’d pursue each complaint one by one, and added that Twitter would have to pay for the arbitration fees per California law.

“Not only will you lose on the merits, but even if you somehow won the victory would by pyrrhic,” the attorney said. “Twitter will pay far more in attorneys’ fees and arbitration costs than it could possibly ‘save’ in severance due.”

In outlining his legal case, Cohen cited the same contract terms Bloom is drawing on, stating that Musk is obligated to match the pre-acquisition severance packages, including employee bonuses and vested stocks. He also said that some of his clients have reported that Twitter isn’t providing them their 401k deductions and company matches, among other corporate benefits.

“I’m sure I don’t need to warn you that’s a bad idea,” Cohen said.

The attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment as to how many clients he’s working with or whether Musk has submitted any response to the letter.

Twitter, which no longer has a formal communications team, could not be reached for comment.

The mass layoffs at Twitter have been a long time coming.

Musk finalized his control of Twitter on Oct. 28 after months of trying to back out of a $44-billion acquisition deal he initiated in April. But as early as June, he was implying that layoffs probably would prove necessary to bring down Twitter’s costs and make the company profitable.

Even before the purchase was finalized, he told investors in one report that he planned to lay off 75% of the company (though he later denied that figure).

At the start of November, Musk laid off nearly 50% of the company, promising three months’ worth of severance to those let go.

Following the layoffs, Musk was almost immediately sued by former employees who alleged that he’d violated federal and state labor laws.

As waves of managers and employees either resigned or were fired for speaking out against Musk’s new regime, he issued an ultimatum : commit to a new, “hardcore” Twitter 2.0 at which employees were expected to work long hours, or leave with three months’ worth of severance. But after thousands of employees reportedly took the exit route , many were left wondering whether the company would keep its promises.

The rising tide of legal claims against Musk suggests that — at least as far as many of his outgoing employees are concerned — the answer to that question has been a resounding no.

https://news.yahoo.com/defense-palm-springs-quadruple-homicide-234137262.html,Defense in Palm Springs quadruple homicide case files for mistrial,"The defense filed motions for mistrial and to dismiss the retrial of a quadruple homicide case in which a Cathedral City man is accused of gunning down four people in Palm Springs, claiming new evidence will make it impossible for the defendant to face a fair trial and violates his right to a fair retrial, according to court documents obtained on Friday.

Jose Vladimir Larin-Garcia, 23, is charged with four counts of first-degree murder for the Feb. 3, 2019, deaths of Jacob Montgomery, 19, Juan Duarte Raya, 18, Yuliana Garcia, 17, and Carlos Campos Rivera, 25. The charges include a special-circumstance allegation of multiple murders and sentence-enhancing gun and great bodily injury allegations.

Jurors in the first trial deliberated over seven days and indicated they were deadlocked on March 8. A new jury was sworn in on Sept. 26.

According to court documents filed on Monday by Larin-Garcia’s defense attorney John Patrick Dolan, he and defense attorney Anthony Valente will seek on Dec. 5 for a mistrial and to dismiss Larin-Garcia’s retrial due to evidence ― a paper bag with a long-missing eighth casing and a cigarette butt ― which was found in the trunk of the Toyota Corolla where three of the shooting victims were found.

Dolan said that Crime Scene Tech Julie Osburn from the Palm Springs Police Department testified on Oct. 24 that a paper bag with debris, collected by a tow truck driver, was missing and was “nothing of evidentiary value,” but on Nov. 8, as detective Escallada and Osburn prepared to take the Toyota Corolla to the Larson Justice Center in Indio for the jury to view on Nov. 9, she found the paper bag in the trunk.

The Corolla was taken to the courthouse with the bag of debris still inside, and after the jury viewed it, it was taken to the storage lot where Osburn photographed the vehicle and removed the bag from the trunk to take to the police department for booking, according to Dolan.

In his motion for a mistrial, Dolan claims that “whether the court decides to admit or exclude the evidence, the defendant will suffer irreparable prejudice and it will be impossible to receive a fair trial.”

In his motion to dismiss the case, he claims the handling of the evidence was an “intentional destruction and neglectful loss of and tampering with evidence,” violating Larin-Garcia’s right to a fair retrial.

During opening statements on Sept. 28, Deputy District Attorney Samantha Paixao told the jury that three of the shooting victims were found in a green Toyota Corolla that crashed at Sunny Dunes and El Placer roads about 11:40 p.m. the day of the killings, while the fourth victim ― Rivera ― was found discarded on a street about a half-mile away.

“He (Montgomery) was shot twice in the face, so the person that would have shot him would have been to the side, next to him, pointing that gun,” Paixao said. “He didn’t stand a chance. He was taken by surprise.”

Montgomery, Raya and Garcia were killed inside the car, authorities said. Garica was pregnant.

“I will stand before you at the end of the trial and ask you to hold him (Larin-Garcia) accountable for each and every count, for each and every allegation for what he stole on that night,” Paixao said. “Four people’s lives.”

Dolan pointed to social media posts and messages allegedly made by John Olvera, then 15, suggesting they implicate him in the killings. He also pointed to a private conversation between Olvera and a woman, in which Olvera allegedly said, “Jacob thought I was playin’ ― he shouldn’t have had a kid and female in the car cuz he knew I was gonna get him” and “I never meant that girl to die.” The message allegedly referred to one of the shooting victims, Jacob Montgomery.

“The people assure that Mr. Larin Garcia, this 19-year-old boy on February 3, 2019, killed four people and he should be held accountable for it,” Dolan said. “That is just despicable. Mr. Olvera took credit for this, he’s the person you should be trying on this case.”

During the first and current trial, Olvera denied any involvement in the killings, saying any posts on Facebook and Instagram suggesting anything to the contrary were unfounded boasts or lyrics by rapper Young Boy.

During closing arguments in the first trial, Paixao dismissed the messages, saying facts in the case did not align with what Olvera claimed occurred. For instance, Olvera claims he was shot at first when evidence indicates only one firearm was involved.

Dolan claimed that Olvera was an unreliable witness at the first trial and that his testimony should not be trusted, only his social media posts taking credit for the homicides. He further argued that police did not properly investigate Olvera when they found the posts, casting reasonable doubt on whether or not his client committed the crime.

In the first trial and again on Sept. 28, Dolan created a scene for the jury in which Olvera was in the middle seat of the car shooting the passengers, and that Larin-Garcia jumped from the vehicle when the killings began. Paixao argued that no evidence was present to suggest a fifth person was in the vehicle, pointing to eyewitness testimony of only four people being present.

Paixao said Larin-Garcia was inside the Corolla with the three victims, and that Montgomery was planning to make a drug deal. The defendant was in the back seat when he allegedly fatally shot Rivera, who was leaning against the car on Canon Drive, south of Theresa Drive, Paixao said.

After the shooting, the driver of the Corolla sped off, but Larin-Garcia allegedly shot the driver as well as the other two occupants, then jumped from the moving car before it crashed into a parked Jeep at Sunny Dunes and El Placer roads, according to the prosecution.

According to Paixao, blood on Larin-Garcia’s shoes and jacket had the DNA of the victims on it, placing him inside the vehicle at the time of the murder. She further argued that bullet casings at the crime scene match those that were found in the defendant’s bedroom and vehicle, further attaching him to the events.

Dolan asserted during his closing argument that the blood splatter identified on Larin-Garcia’s clothing did not prove murder, and there was no search for a gun the prosecution claims he used in the crime, only bullet casings.

According to preliminary hearing testimony in the first trial, Larin- Garcia was found by officers hiding under a pickup just blocks from the scene of the Corolla crash. He was taken to Desert Regional Medical Center for treatment of minor injuries but wasn’t arrested.

The defendant left the hospital after being questioned by Palm Springs police, going to a friend’s house. Detective Steve Grissom testified that the friend went to the defendant’s mother’s home to retrieve fresh clothing and an ID card for the defendant. Later in the day, the friend also bought bandages for Larin-Garcia, along with a Greyhound bus ticket to Florida under the name “Joseph Browning,” Grissom testified.

At some point that day, Larin-Garcia shaved his head to change his appearance, then the friend drove him to the bus station in Indio, where Larin- Garcia was arrested, Grissom testified.

Larin-Garcia remains held without bail at the Benoit Detention Center in Indio.

An undercover officer who spoke with Larin-Garcia while posing as a jail inmate testified that the defendant admitted fearing that officers had obtained his gun as evidence, though Larin-Garcia never admitted to a specific crime and the gun has never been found.

https://americanfreepress.net/americans-take-to-the-streets-over-alien-invasion/,Americans Take to the Streets Over Alien Invasion – American Free Press,"• Across U.S., citizens protest insane immigration policy adopted by Obama, Holder.

By John Friend —

RAMONA, Calif.—During the past week, the crisis along the United States-Mexico border and the invasion of America by illegal aliens has not generated as many headlines as it has in previous weeks. That fact, however, does not mean the situation along the southern border of the U.S. has stabilized or that Americans are uninterested in the latest developments regarding these issues.

In late July, Texas Governor Rick Perry (R) ordered as many as 1,000 troops from the National Guard to be deployed along the Texas-Mexico border to deal with the border crisis.

Speaking at a press briefing in Austin recently, Perry stated: “There can be no national security without border security, and Texans have paid too high a price for the federal government’s failure to secure our border.”







Perry’s move appears to be largely symbolic and likely designed to generate support for his future political ambitions. National Guard troops do not have the authority to make arrests and will only be playing a supportive role in an effort to deter Mexican drug cartels, human traffickers and other criminal activity, while referring suspected illegal immigrants to federal Border Patrol authorities.

“Our role is to look for the criminal element,” Lt. Col. Joanne MacGregor, a spokeswoman for the Texas National Guard, recently explained. “We are going to have a very thoughtful, thorough training plan so that everyone knows” what the National Guard’s limitations are.

Meanwhile, anti-illegal immigration protests are erupting across the nation. On July 26, thousands of protesters took to the streets of Boston, expressing their disgust and outrage at the federal government’s response to the illegal alien invasion of America. Popular Boston-area radio host Jeff Kuhner, who hosts “The Kuhner Report” on WRKO, organized the rally, which he estimated drew close to 10,000 people, if not more.

“I’ve never seen any kind of backlash like this before on any issue ever,” Kuhner explained to Boston.com. “People in this state are livid. They feel betrayed by the political elite.”

Kuhner and other protesters were particularly upset about the allegation that children are illegally entering the U.S., often after making a dangerous trek through their country of origin and Mexico to reach America with the expectation of receiving amnesty and other political, social and economic benefits. “These are not children,” said Kuhner. “When you say child, the implication is 4, 5, 6 [years old]. They’re teenagers—many of them are gangbangers. . . . If you’re 15, you’re not a child. A child is 12 and under.”

Echoing Kuhner’s concerns, economist Michael Snyder, who maintains the popular “The Economic Collapse” website, recently warned his readers that “Barack Obama has allowed hundreds of thousands of gang members to illegally enter the United States and settle in our major cities” by refusing to protect the American border.

“In many communities, gang activity is already wildly out of control, and some day our cities will burn because of the foolishness of the federal government,” Snyder stated.

Southern California continues to be a flashpoint for illegal immigration protests and other activism against the federal government and the Obama administration.









In Ramona, a small city in rural northeast San Diego County, Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona recently spoke to the Ramona TEA’d organization, which drew 400 people and roughly 20-25 counter protesters. The venue was filled to capacity, and numerous individuals were turned away at the door.

Arpaio addressed the illegal invasion of America, sponsored and facilitated by the federal government, along with the ongoing crime spree against the American people emanating from Washington.

William Gheen, the president of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC (ALIPAC), and James Neighbors of Overpasses for America, announced plans for nationwide anti-illegal immigration protests in the weeks ahead, largely in response to Texas Representative Luis Gutierrez’s (D) outrageous comments that Hispanics should receive amnesty and American citizenship in order to punish Americans who are against illegal immigration and the transformation of the United States into a Third World country.

“Representatives from among the more than 50 organizations that recently conducted protests against illegal immigration in more than 300 locations nationwide have announced a new large wave of protests to take place October 24-25, in response to Gutierrez’s comments about using amnesty for illegals to punish Americans who oppose illegal immigration,” reads a July 22 ALIPAC press release.

Other protests are scheduled in the weeks leading up to October 24-25 and are designed to target congressional Republicans, who support amnesty.

“It is time for Americans to unify against immigration reform amnesty and to punish outlandish and corrupt politicians like Luis Gutierrez in the 2014 elections,” said Gheen.

Neighbors added: “Representative Gutierrez should resign or face censure by the Congress for his comments that are inappropriate for any elected official or government employee paid by our taxes!”

Democratic leaders in Washington, D.C. and leading leftist pundits, activists and organizations in America are demanding Congress approve the $3.7 billion President Barack Obama has requested to deal with the crisis and coddle the illegal aliens invading America.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) went so far as to compare the thousands of young people illegally entering the U.S. with “baby Jesus” on the popular MSNBC program “Morning Joe,” adding that Jesus “was a refugee from violence,” and that the U.S. has a humanitarian obligation to care for the illegal invaders.

In a similarly brazen move, the American Civil Liberties Union of San Diego County is even threatening to sue the city of Escondido in north San Diego County for rejecting an illegal immigration shelter to be used to house and care for illegal aliens shipped from the U.S.-Mexico border to southern California.

https://news.yahoo.com/judge-strikes-down-higher-education-175541505.html,Judge strikes down higher education portions of DeSantis’s ‘Stop WOKE Act’,"A federal judge on Thursday struck down provisions of Florida’s “Stop WOKE Act” that prohibited public college employees from promoting eight concepts related to race during instruction.

U.S. District Judge Mark Walker, who previously blocked other portions of the law in a separate case, quoted the opening sentence of George Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984” as he issued a preliminary injunction blocking the law’s higher education provisions and pushed back on the state’s arguments.

“‘It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen,’ and the powers in charge of Florida’s public university system have declared the State has unfettered authority to muzzle its professors in the name of ‘freedom,’” Walker wrote.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and state GOP lawmakers championed the legislation as fighting back against a “woke” agenda pushed by liberals and banning the instilling of critical race theory.

An undergraduate student, student organization and professor at the University of South Florida filed the suit in September and were supported by a variety of legal advocacy organizations.

Walker ruled the First Amendment protects professors’ in-class speech and the provisions were impermissibly vague, describing the law as “positively dystopian” as he compared it to the Ministry of Truth, the propaganda agency in Orwell’s novel.

“Our professors are critical to a healthy democracy, and the State of Florida’s decision to choose which viewpoints are worthy of illumination and which must remain in the shadows has implications for us all,” Walker ruled.

“If our ‘priests of democracy’ are not allowed to shed light on challenging ideas, then democracy will die in darkness,” he added. “But the First Amendment does not permit the State of Florida to muzzle its university professors, impose its own orthodoxy of viewpoints and cast us all into the dark.”

The American Civil Liberties Union, the Legal Defense Fund and the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, all of whom were involved in challenges to the law, celebrated Thursday’s ruling.

Bryan Griffin, DeSantis’s press secretary, said the decision included several victories for the state, but that they intend to appeal.

“We strongly disagree with Judge Walker’s preliminary injunction orders on the enforcement of the Stop W.O.K.E. Act and will continue to fight to prevent Florida’s students and employees from being subjected to discriminatory classroom instruction or mandated discriminatory workplace training,” Griffin said.

“The Stop W.O.K.E. Act protects the open exchange of ideas by prohibiting teachers or employers who hold agency over others from forcing discriminatory concepts on students as part of classroom instruction or on employees as a condition of maintaining employment,” Griffin added. “An ‘open-minded and critical’ environment necessitates that one is free from discrimination.”

The State University System of Florida declined to comment.

Walker previously issued a preliminary injunction blocking some of the law’s other provisions, which prevented companies from requiring employees to attend any activity or training that violates the eight concepts.

REUTERS/Lindsay DeDario/File Photo Get license rights

Nov 16 (Reuters) – Workers at hundreds of Starbucks ( SBUX.O ) stores walked off the job during a major promotional event on Thursday, demanding improved staffing and schedules, Workers United said on social media platform X.

The walkout comes on the heels of the coffee chain’s Red Cup Day event, during which Starbucks offers free red, reusable, holiday-themed cups to customers who buy coffee.

Starbucks said Thursday that its stores were “open” in the U.S. “A few dozen stores with some partners were on strike,” but more than half of those stores were open this morning, “serving customers.”

About a dozen workers picketed outside the Starbucks Astor Place store on New York University’s campus, chanting “no contract, no coffee” and other rhymes. Meanwhile, Astor Place continued to fill orders with NYU staff and students.

Red Cup Day is typically a major driver of store traffic, with visits to US Starbucks stores last year up 94% over the full-year daily average, Placer.ai data shows.

Workers United, which represents more than 9,000 Starbucks employees at about 360 US stores, said the event was one of the “most notoriously difficult, no-staff days” as drink orders piled up and employees resorted to abuse out of frustration. Customers with long waiting times.

Mary Boca, 22, an Astor Place, New York barista, said she would like to see higher wages and more employees at Starbucks.

“I’ve heard our managers say they have to hire 12 people. At the peak, a lot of people have to leave.”

Boca’s Starbucks location doesn’t allow customers to tip, leaving them with an extra $100 on each check.

Edwin Palma Solis, 24, who works at Astor Place, said the inability of customers to tip at the store has prevented some employees from joining the place.

Starbucks has nearly 10,000 U.S. company-owned locations, and fewer than 3% of those stores are represented by a union, according to the company.

Last year, workers at more than 100 US company-owned Starbucks locations staged a one-day strike on Red Cup Day.

Earlier this month, Starbucks said it would raise hourly wages for its U.S. retail workers by at least 3% starting in 2024, a move criticized by employees, who called it “tone cheesy” given Starbucks’ 11% fourth-quarter revenue increase and recent wage increases. The auto workers won.

It is late November, and she is busy finishing up the 69th episode of her podcast Murdaugh Murders, a true-crime investigation she began in 2019, and which has now evolved into a complex puzzle of unsolved deaths, insurance fraud, drugs, power and murder. The previous day, a jury in Charleston, South Carolina delivered the first guilty verdict related to the case, and Matney was of course there to cover it. “It was super exciting, and really felt like a huge sigh of relief,” she says. “It’s been a crazy couple of weeks.”

Hedley Thomas knows this feeling well. Earlier this year, he experienced a similar vindication when his 2018 podcast series The Teacher’s Pet led to the conviction of former high school PE teacher Chris Dawson for the murder of his wife, Lynette, who disappeared from the couple’s Sydney home 40 years ago. For the past year, Thomas has also been reporting on the murder of another Queensland woman, Shandee Blackburn, and the failings of a DNA laboratory, in Shandee’s Story.

When we speak, it is the morning after he has been a speaker at a Women in Media event in Brisbane, where the audience were dedicated fans of his podcasts. “They admitted that they were fangirling,” Thomas says, looking bemused, “which is a fairly novel thing for someone in my position.”

Matney and Thomas are part of a wave of true-crime podcasters who have moved the genre from historical storytelling and into a vital new form of investigative journalism, shedding light on cold cases, wrongful convictions and broader injustices. Their successes have joined those of Serial, which helped overturn the conviction of Adnan Syed, a Baltimore man who spent 23 years in prison for the murder of his ex-girlfriend, and In the Dark, which helped free Curtis Flowers, a Mississippi man who was tried six times for the same crime, and also spent 23 years in jail. In California, the Your Own Backyard podcast was instrumental in reopening the investigation into the 1996 disappearance of student Kristin Smart; in October, Paul Flores was found guilty of her murder.

These podcasts have not only proved hugely popular – Matney notes that Murdaugh Murders has just gone above 45m downloads – they also offer glimmers of hope that legions of unsolved crimes, murders and disappearances could be solved given similar attention. But they also raise questions: why has it fallen to podcasters to take up the work of police investigators? And how might this new era of sleuthing affect the legal process?

From their homes in South Carolina and Brisbane, Matney and Thomas discuss the highs and lows of their podcasting experiences, and where the medium may head next.

You both have years of investigative print and online journalism under your belts – Mandy, at publications such as FITSNews and the Island Packet, Hedley at the Australian and the Courier-Mail. What made you move into podcasting and what has the medium given you that print does not?

Mandy Matney I wanted to do a podcast ever since I listened to the first episode of Serial; I was probably 25 at the time, I was young in my career. I listened to that episode and it just changed my idea of storytelling, and changed the way that I thought about journalism.

Then, for two years, I was investigating a boat crash in South Carolina that killed a young girl, and it was pretty much only followed locally; that’s the only people that cared about it. But then the kid who was accused of driving the boat was suddenly murdered, along with his mom, in June of 2021. And that got the whole world’s attention: swarms and swarms of media covered this case, and they were all getting the story wrong; they were making it look like this powerful family [of the boat driver] had to be the victims, and somebody from this boat crash was taking advantage of them.

And basically, I cared so much about getting the story straight. I realised that true-crime podcasts are super popular, and I realised that my work in print journalism was not going to reach the number of people that my competitors would, no matter what I did. I thought: “If I don’t do it, somebody else will, and they’re going to do it the wrong way.”

Hedley Thomas I too had listened to Serial, and I felt it was compelling but also frustrating at times. But I was definitely riveted by the idea of a podcast series. I decided I wanted to do something that would be harder and much more challenging than anything I’d tried before in journalism. My wife was listening to so many podcasts, she said: “Look, you love the sound of your own voice. Why don’t you have a crack?”

So then it came to working out what sort of story would be justified: what was a case that I had thought about for some time that I might be able to make a difference in? And probably just like Mandy, I don’t want to take on cases that are solved, and can be reheated, with some new bells and whistles. If you’re going to put in that much effort, you want to go for a cold case that hasn’t been solved.

This case of Lynette Dawson’s disappearance was the one that I really had been troubled by since 2001. I first reported on it as a much younger newspaper reporter. And it struck me as a likely case of murder involving a man who’d become completely obsessed, infatuated with this teenage schoolgirl whom he moved into the house to be the family’s babysitter. He disrespected his wife and family so much that he was sleeping with the babysitter in the spare room after giving his wife alcohol so she would fall asleep. And then after his wife disappears, and the babysitter moves into the family home, becomes a sex slave and a stepmother, everyone carries on as normal in this beautiful part of northern Sydney near the beach. And so the fact that case hadn’t been solved really bugged me.

I think the best podcasts probably come from a purpose that the storyteller feels. And I think listeners hear that. They hear the authenticity, the righteous indignation, of the storyteller as they’re going through it. You need to be fairly invested. And it sounds like Mandy has been really invested as well.

MM Yes, definitely. This case is my very weird baby that I don’t know if I like sometimes but I care about it so much. But on the other side of that, what I was told in journalism school was: “Rule number one: stay out of the story.” So it’s confusing, when you really do care. I’ve developed friendships and real relationships with a lot of the victims.

The other thing with podcasting that’s been so overwhelmingly positive is just the reach that you can get with in-depth journalism. I mean, I worked in newspapers before but I have never seen this reach, or people that pay such serious attention to every detail of a one-hour podcast. People really do care about this, and they’ll get behind you and root for you.

So it’s been hard, but I’m glad that I tugged at the strings years ago, not knowing that they would expose this giant spider web of crimes.

As true-crime podcasts such as yours have helped bring about exposure, convictions and, in some cases, the overturning of convictions, they’ve also drawn criticism from some quarters, including the suggestion that they can pervert the course of justice. Do you think that’s fair?

HT Chris Dawson was arrested and charged with murder at the start of December 2018, as we were bringing out what was going to be the final episode of The Teacher’s Pet. Police had been following up a number of witnesses who talked to me in the podcast series and obtaining their evidence and statements.

[When Dawson went to trial] the director of public prosecutions wrote to our editor-in-chief, and we agreed to remove the podcast series in Australia – in the same way that a book could be withdrawn if its publication coincided with someone’s trial and the book was all about the accused. But it continued to play around the world and has done, uninterrupted.

Chris Dawson fought tooth and nail to avoid going to trial. His argument was that he couldn’t get a fair trial because everybody who listened to the podcast believed that he was guilty. We were put under enormous scrutiny. All of my audio recordings, text messages, WhatsApp messages, Facebook Messenger, everything ended up being the subject of a subpoena. We were handing over huge amounts of material and then submitting to be cross-examined by Chris Dawson’s silk in a supreme court proceeding.

Along the way, the judges who represented the institution of criminal justice in Australia would give me or the podcast a whack, not arguing that we made any mistakes, but that this man and his alleged crime had been unpacked in such detail that it was, as one judge said, “The most egregious interference in the criminal justice system that the court had seen.”

It just shows me how out of touch some people in the system still are in relation to the terrible trauma, pain, frustration suffered by victims of crime. The institutions had utterly failed for almost 40 years: larger organisations, police, prosecutors and courts have been found wanting or have utterly and hopelessly and egregiously failed to do their jobs properly. But, you know, let’s give journalism a bit of a kicking on the way through.

MM I can’t believe your podcast was pulled! You’re reminding me that there are some good things in the United States – granted, some states have better laws for journalists than others. But for the most part, that would never happen in the United States. And I think you hit the nail on the head: all these people should have done their jobs years ago. That’s where I’m at, too. I’ve uncovered crimes that should have been uncovered a decade ago.

It will be interesting to see what the legal system across the world does with this. In the United States, the laws are really designed around the internet not existing. With this murder trial coming up, there’s no place in South Carolina that you’re going to get a jury that hasn’t heard of this, but you could get a jury of people that will be able to look at the facts and be able to make an unbiased decision. I do think laws need to catch up with the times – and nobody saw podcasts coming.

A lot of your listeners are, in fact, strikingly well informed, and invested in your cases. What do you think the appeal is for them, and particularly for female listeners, who make up a large proportion of the true-crime podcast listenership?

MM In the last year and a half of really being in the universe of true crime, I’ve noticed that it’s almost like a sport for women – or not a sport, because they do express empathy for the victims and are able to do this all in a respectful way. But when we have YouTube broadcast a few of the court proceedings live, we have noticed that it’s mostly women [watching] and it’s like they want to root for their team, and talk to the other fans about the inner workings. I’m sure with your case, Hedley, you’ve seen Facebook groups and Reddit threads break out, with all these people getting to know each other because they’re all obsessed with the same thing. And I think that people really love that human connection – it makes you a part of a community.

HT The three major cold case murder investigations I’ve done have all revolved round women who were missing, almost certainly murdered, and one very brutally murdered. And it’s undoubtedly true that most of the listeners are women. The theory that I have, and it’s been informed by women talking to me about what they get out of podcasts, is that a lot of them are doing it out of a sense of self-preservation. My wife said to me: “You’ll never know what it’s like to be leaving work at night and holding your keys between your fingers like a weapon, in case you are assaulted.” And that is something that women have had to learn to do. So they are wanting to better understand the drivers for homicide, whether it’s partner homicide or stranger homicide. They are wanting to better understand the red flags that tell of a narcissistic or sociopathic, predatory male. From these very long series they are being counselled, educated, given so much information where they would not necessarily have got it from the other forms of media, at least not in the same powerful way.

MM Another thing that I found in all of this is you get emails all the time: “I need help here. Please come here and investigate this … ” There’s a huge need for deep-dive investigative journalism around the world because the police aren’t doing their jobs. The government in general isn’t doing its job. And, oh my gosh, there are so many unsolved murders around the world.",Q4

Hargett entered what is known as a ""best interest"" plea deal, which is a formal guilty plea while maintaining he's innocent of the charge.

""My counsel believes I had a strong case to argue before the court, and I have been surprised by some events and actions during this experience,"" Hargett said in a statement released by his office. ""However, my desire is to accept responsibility for my actions and move forward and to focus on how God can use me to make something positive from this difficult time.""

Hargett said the months since his arrest have ""been humbling and at times very dark for me.""

""It is wrong to drive any vehicle under the influence of alcohol, and rest assured this is a mistake I will never make again,"" Hargett said.

A Tullahoma police officer observed Hargett's vehicle leaving 315 Bar before it ran over line markings for at least three blocks, according to Hargett's Coffee County arrest warrant.

After pulling Hargett over, the officer said, he smelled an ""intoxicant"" in the vehicle and noted Hargett's eyes ""were glossy.""

""The subject kept saying yes sir at inappropriate times when he had not yet been asked a question,"" the affidavit stated.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/12/11/loudoun-niemeyer-roberts-race/,Judge says chief justice’s ‘cute phrase’ on racism not helpful in Va. case,"In a court fight over school anti-bias initiatives in Virginia, an attorney for a conservative advocacy group representing the plaintiffs quoted one of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.’s most famous proclamations: “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”

Roberts made the comment in 2007 as part of a decision that struck down voluntary school desegregation plans in the states of Washington and Kentucky. And some might assume that the three Republican-nominated appellate court judges in Richmond weighing the Virginia case could be a receptive audience for the comment.

But Judge Paul V. Niemeyer took the opportunity to opine on why he thought Roberts’s formulation fell short.

“That’s a cute phrase,” said the Reagan appointee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. But in cases in which juries identify racial discrimination, he said, “we provide remedies that … take race into account. … When you have discrimination and you create a particularized remedy, it necessarily has racial aspects to it.”

The exchange came last week in a lawsuit involving anti-bias initiatives in Loudoun County’s public schools. Parents in Loudoun are suing over “student equity ambassadors” tasked with sharing examples of racial discrimination and bias with administrators, saying the initiative discriminates against White conservatives and chills free speech.

The lawsuit reached the federal appellate court after a district court judge ruled in January that there was no constitutional violation in the matter, only a disagreement over priorities that should be handled within the school system.

The case is part of a backlash across the country against school programs intended to combat racism, with similar cases finding success at the collegiate level in multiple states.

The Loudoun program was created after a districtwide audit found that Black, Latino and Muslim students “were particularly affected by racial insults or slurs, and even racially motivated violent actions,” in the words of a court filing from the Loudoun County School Board.

When looking at what constitutes racial discrimination, Niemeyer said, “The question is . . . how far back do you go? That’s not an easy issue for us to tackle.”

In pushing back against Roberts’s assessment on race in the desegregation case, Niemeyer referenced laws governing workplace discrimination by private employers, something experts say conservatives on the Supreme Court and in lower courts have not moved to undo while rolling back broader racial protections in other realms. The Supreme Court in 2020 expanded its reading of workplace discrimination to include transgender people, a decision Roberts joined.

Some fear that the Supreme Court could upend interpretations of protections that have been in place for decades.

“This extremely aggressive Supreme Court could revisit that precedent,” said Kenji Yoshino, a constitutional law professor at New York University. “But for now, lower courts are bound by it, not by the chief justice’s statement.”

Miranda McGowan of the University of San Diego School of Law said precedent similar to the workplace protections applies in a school context.

“When a court finds that the government has indeed discriminated on the basis of race [then] the government can (and indeed must) fashion a race-conscious remedy to cure the racial discrimination,” she wrote by email. “What the Supreme Court has foreclosed is action to address broader societal discrimination.”

The Loudoun case may be decided on narrower grounds. All three judges on the appellate court panel expressed skepticism that the parents could challenge the program as racially discriminatory when none of their children had applied to be ambassadors. In a draft announcement that became public, Loudoun County Public Schools described the ambassadorship as “specifically for students of Color.” But by the time the program was implemented, White students could serve — and since then have served — as ambassadors, the judges noted.

“I haven’t seen where you have pled that you have been denied admission or excluded or even wanted to … become a student equity ambassador,” Judge A. Marvin Quattlebaum Jr., a Trump appointee, told the plaintiffs’ attorney at oral argument. “You just have a disagreement with it.”

The program website says the students should have “a passion for social justice.” Daniel Suhr of the Liberty Justice Center said the students he represents for the plaintiffs “did not apply because they knew they would not be accepted.”

But the judges were more open to the idea that school investigations of alleged student bias might chill free speech by, in Niemeyer’s words, encouraging “student-on-student snitching” about “heated” school discussions.

Suhr said after the hearing that it was “encouraging that … the court consistently recognized the importance of those free speech rights in the school context as much as in any part of our society.”

Andrew Selman, arguing for the school board, said there was no evidence of students being disciplined over allegations of bias: “The chill has to be reasonable.”

In January, U.S. District Judge Anthony Trenga ruled that the parents failed to show that the school system’s diversity initiatives violate the First Amendment and the equal-protection clause of the U.S. Constitution.",Q4
https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/butler-county/west-chester/defense-claims-potential-suspects-overlooked-in-west-chester-quadruple-murder,Defense claims potential suspects overlooked in West Chester quadruple murder,"HAMILTON, Ohio — Two more people involved in the initial murder investigation took the stand in the trial of Gurpreet Singh.

Prosecutors accuse Singh of killing his wife, Shalinderjit Kaur; her parents Hakiakat Singh Pannag and Parmjit Kaur; along with and Parmjit's sister Amarjit Kaur in the family's West Chester apartment in 2019.

Former West Chester police officer Adam Gecewich shed tears on the stand when prosecutors asked what he saw inside Singh's apartment the night of the murders.

Gecewich told jurors he was among the first officers to respond to Gurpreet Singh's 911 call. Gecewich's superiors assigned him to stand with Singh as paramedics examined Gurpreet for 15 minutes, Gecewich testified. The former officer described the defendant as emotional and hysterical.

However, Gecewich needed 44 seconds to compose himself before telling jurors about the scene inside Singh's apartment.

""Inside the door was the body of a female on the floor,"" Gecewich said on the stand. ""In the middle of the apartment was another body of a female and then I could see the feet of the third body just on the other side of counter.""

Gecewich also testified that Singh had blood on his pants, shirt, hands and repeatedly asked about his three children. The former officer then performed a welfare check on the children and found all three safe with Gurpreet Singh's sister.

West Chester Police Sergeant Travis Oakes testified that he interviewed Singh that same night. Prosecutors played another officer's body camera footage, which recorded the interaction with Singh.

""Could you please tell me if she's okay,"" Singh said from the back of a police cruiser in the video.

""Is your wife one of the people who are in there?"" Oakes said in the footage shown in court. ""She's deceased.""

Prosecutors also called two former neighbors, Jeff Lewis and Donna Brown, to testify about the noises they heard the man Lewis twice saw walk out the back patio sliding door of the victim's apartment.

During opening statements, Singh's lawyers told jurors police zeroed in on the defendant despite a member of the victims' family telling police and the FBI that a known member of a land mafia in India could be involved.

They challenged Oakes on the stand about it Monday.

""During the course of the investigation, you interviewed multiple people who mentioned Kuldeep Sekhon as the mastermind behind the killings correct?"" Charlie Rittgers, one of Singh's attorneys, asked Oakes.

""I did not personally but I know that several of the detective interviews gleaned that information,"" Oakes said.

Singh's defense team said Kuldeep Sekhon is wanted by Interpol and the FBI, and owed Hakiakat Pannag $1.5 million in a land deal that failed in 2011 and threatened one of Pannag's business partners. The defense showed jurors a document canceling power of attorney Hakiakat gave his partner because the man said Sekhon threatened him.

West Chester Detective Kevin Burger told jurors he found close to $10,000 in cash in Singh's apartment. Some of it was in his father-in-law's room, Burger testified. However, investigators also found a pink purse with more than $8,000 in Singh's room, the detective told jurors. They also found evidence that Gurpreet Singh spent $20,000 on a home down payment near Indianapolis, Burger said on the stand. The document shown in court suggested the house was a gift for a ""relative"" named Navkurian Kaur. The relationship, though, was more intimate, Burger testified.

""She was an extramarital affair with Mr. Singh, Gurpreet Singh,"" Burger said.

The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations dive team recovered a 9mm Ruger pistol from a pond near the murder scene Burger testified. Prosecutors showed jurors photos of the serial number bored out by someone with a drill.

Testimony will continue Tuesday.

https://news.yahoo.com/news-analysis-biden-administrations-complicated-100046662.html,"News Analysis: Biden administration's complicated relationship with Mexico 'is not working, but it is not kaput'","The Biden administration has been dedicating a significant amount of time to its prickly ally and neighbor to the south, Mexico.

High-level meetings have taken place in both countries over the last two weeks, with the two sides speaking of their determination to cooperate on vexing issues including migration and cross-border smuggling of fentanyl and weapons.

But even as America’s top diplomat, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, extolled what he judged to be the countries’ “closest cooperation” in decades, Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was excoriating the U.S. for its foreign policy.

Late last month, as Mexico's Foreign Secretary Alicia Bárcena met with Blinken in Washington ahead of his arrival in Mexico City last week for more talks, López Obrador condemned the U.S. for spending billions of dollars on the war in Ukraine, saying it dwarfs what is allocated to address poverty in Latin America, a root cause of migration.

The Mexican president went on to urge the Biden administration to “stop harassing free and independent countries” with economic embargoes and sanctions, a reference to Venezuela and Cuba, whose autocratic governments President Biden refused to invite to last year’s Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles. Mexico, with friendly ties to Caracas and Havana, criticized that decision, and López Obrador boycotted the hemispheric gathering.

López Obrador’s rhetoric is part of a well-worn playbook. Even if the timing might seem inopportune, he often takes a nationalistic, anti-American stance, particularly during election season. Mexico holds presidential elections next year, and while López Obrador is barred from seeking reelection, he intends to promote his handpicked successor.

U.S. officials have become accustomed to López Obrador’s verbal barrages — often delivered in his near-daily, hours-long news conferences that are broadcast live on Mexican television and radio — and have taken pains to avoid criticizing him or his public statements. By most accounts, the Mexican president takes a very different and friendlier tone in private — more business-like and less ideological.

Meanwhile, U.S. officials have emphasized their attempts to work with a broader group of Mexican governmental counterparts.

“One of the hallmarks of our cooperation with the government of Mexico is the ability for all agencies and all of those at all levels to roll up our sleeves and get work done,” a senior U.S. administration official said, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity.

On Thursday, as he wrapped up meetings in Mexico City, Blinken and other U.S. officials said they were confident López Obrador was a reliable ally in the fight against fentanyl, drug trafficking and illegal immigration.

“We have a very strong partner, and today we actually strengthened that partnership even more,” Blinken said at a news conference in the ornate National Palace.

He said he had “no doubt” that Mexico was committed to “working collaboratively” with the United States.

“And it’s not simply a commitment of words, as important as that is,"" Blinken said. ""It’s a commitment in deeds.”

Still, when the man at the top sets the tone, it can make getting that work done a little complicated.

López Obrador for months refused to acknowledge the magnitude of the fentanyl crisis or Mexico’s role in it. Mexico is primarily a transshipment point, where traffickers use precursor chemicals from China to supply the synthetic opiate to the United States, where it is a leading cause of death for thousands of American adults ages 18 to 49, according to U.S. statistics.

During Thursday’s news conference, as a slate of senior U.S. officials looked on, Mexican officials contradicted each other on whether fentanyl is produced in Mexico or merely transshipped through the country. The Drug Enforcement Administration says it is produced in Mexico in clandestine labs, though some Mexican officials refute that assertion.

“It is very hard to factor in cooperation when the [Mexican] president sees the U.S. as a liability or potential threat,” said Lila Abed, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, a think tank in Washington, who recently gave a closed-door briefing to members of Congress on U.S.-Mexico ties. She was alluding to the history of Washington intervention in Latin America and especially in Mexico, which has remained close to the surface in Mexican political consciousness.

“The U.S. is going to have a hard time establishing faith in security cooperation,” she added.

A product of 1970s Mexico’s leftist, anti-imperialism movement, López Obrador has a fiercely nationalistic belief in Mexican sovereignty that is influenced by a remembrance of past invasions, including from the U.S. But much of his public rhetoric is aimed at his political base to rally support among large labor unions, workers and voters.

“Within himself, there is ambivalence toward the U.S.; it pulls him in two directions,” said Tony Payan, director of the Center for the United States and Mexico at Rice University. “He doesn’t like the dependence” on the U.S.

But López Obrador also knows there’s only so much he can do about it. The two countries are tightly intertwined — economically, politically and culturally. Mexico is now the largest trade partner to the U.S., surpassing China last year. Mexico is also heavily dependent on tourism and on remittances from its nationals who work in the U.S.

And so it is in the interest of both governments to keep cordial relations and strategic agreements afloat, Payan said. Yet the depth of López Obrador’s commitment remains to be seen, he added.

The Mexican president’s strategy is “to shirk and drag his feet — there are a lot of ‘yeses’ without really doing too much,” Payan said.

“The relationship is hobbling along,"" he said. ""It is not smooth, but it is not broken. It is not working, but it is not kaput.”

But Mexican and U.S. officials insisted on praising the relationship on immigration and the fentanyl fight.

Bárcena, who joined the news conference with Blinken on Thursday at the National Palace, defended López Obrador, saying he gave ""very precise instructions"" for ""supporting and collaborating in everything that has to do with the production, trafficking, consumption of fentanyl.""

Blinken also gave an upbeat assessment as he wrapped up the talks, which also included Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas and Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland.

“More than ever before in my 30 years of being engaged in foreign policy, the United States and Mexico are working together as partners in common purpose,” Blinken said. “But the scale and scope of the challenges that we face is also unprecedented. And I think today we reflected on both of those facts — the unprecedented partnership, but also the unprecedented challenges.”

Faced with surges in both fentanyl smuggling and the number of migrants attempting to enter the U.S., Blinken said the officials agreed on a series of steps including better monitoring and tracing of the chemical precursors that arrive from Asia, more dismantling of clandestine drug labs and sharing resources to treat addiction.

On immigration, the most dramatic development was an announcement that the U.S., Mexico, Colombia and Panama had agreed to begin deporting Venezuelans to their home country, a reversal after hundreds of thousands from that nation have fled to neighboring countries and the U.S.

While the officials were meeting in Mexico City, it was revealed that the Biden administration resumed construction of a portion of the southern border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, another reversal in practice. Officials said the administration was legally obliged to spend money appropriated for the project during the Trump administration.

It was sour news for the Mexican government.

""On my side, I’m telling you that, of course, we are not in favor of anything of the sort,"" Bárcena said in a rare point of open dispute with the Americans. ""We believe in bridges, not in walls.""

Port workers moving cargo [Photo: ILWU/Facebook]

The demands being made by the membership are control over the tying up of vessels contracted to CSA, more workers assigned per unit, and retroactive payout of benefits and pensions from the company since the last contract expired.

The dockworkers, members of ILA Local 1410, are in an immensely powerful position. The growing significance of the Port of Mobile within the regional and national supply chain cannot be understated, and a strike would immediately win the widespread support of dockworkers around the world, as well as workers in other critical sectors of industry such as the railroads. It is for this reason that Mobile dockworkers should prepare to strike on Friday, and send the broadest appeal to their working class brothers and sisters to join them in the process.

Just under half of the ILA’s 65,000 members work on ports throughout the Gulf Coast and South Atlantic along the east coast. It has members at some of the largest ports in the contiguous US, such as in Houston and southern Louisiana.

Since APM Terminals launched its container operations at Mobile in 2008, Director and CEO of the Alabama Port Authority John C. Driscoll stated last month that the Port has gone on to become “the 11th largest U.S. Seaport.”

Over 160,000 jobs in the state are directly or indirectly connected to the Port’s operations, such as Amazon and Hyundai, with Driscoll commenting, “there is not a single county in Alabama that doesn’t have some connection to the Port.”

Importing an assortment of retail products and exporting a wide variety of products such as poultry, wood pulp, lumber and factory components, the Port plays a critical role in the regional and national supply chain.

Class I railroad carriers BNSF, CSX, Kansas City Southern, Norfolk Southern, and Canadian National have terminals at the Port. Driscoll recently stated in an interview, “Products can get from the Port of Mobile through Jackson, Mississippi, Memphis, Tennessee and ultimately to Chicago in three days,” as well as up to Canada. Rail traffic at the port has increased by 150 percent as of this year.

This demonstrates, Driscoll concluded, that the port is “strategically positioned to offer service directly into the middle of the country, providing an uncongested and fluid gateway into key North American markets in less time and at less expense than other coastal ports.”

The volume of container handling and movement at the Port has rapidly increased since last year. Workers at the Port are on pace to surpass 500,000 TEUs (twenty-foot containers, a standard of measurement in shipping based on a single 20-foot cargo unit) moved this year, over 15 percent higher than last year. With a $104 million expansion project currently underway for APM Terminals, as well as two other major expansion projects involving Norfolk Southern and CSX, the company’s goal is to reach one million TEUs moved annually by 2025.

With intermodal rail and refrigerated cargo transportation at the Port up by 141 and 16 percent, respectively, since September 2021, the Port “has been the fastest-growing port in the last five years,” according to Driscoll.

This development accounts for an uptick in the rerouting of cargo ships from the larger docks on the West Coast to the Gulf Coast. This process, however, is primarily a result of the ruling capitalist class’s disastrous COVID-19 policies and their concomitant disruptions to the global supply chain.

Commenting on the growing importance of the seaports along the Gulf Coast, Margaret Kidd, a professor and program director of supply chain and logistics technology at the University of Houston, said, “You can’t have 40 percent of all containers coming in from Asia in LA-Long Beach.” This accounts for the massive expansion projects currently underway not only at the Port of Mobile (the combined aim of which is to turn the Port into the deepest of all the container terminals along the Gulf), but also in Houston, which launched a $1 billion channel-widening project this year.

Underscoring the strategic importance of the Port of Mobile, Driscoll stated, “Alabama is in one of the best positions geographically, politically and economically to be the answer to the country’s supply chain struggles that we have all witnessed over the past couple of years.”

It is for these reasons that the corporations that operate out of the Port, the federal down to the local government, and the entire AFL-CIO union apparatus are working around the clock to prevent a strike by workers in the critical sectors of industry dependent on the Port.

The fact that five Class I railroads are operating at the port no doubt factors into these calculations. With their eyes nervously following the negotiations between the carriers, government and union bureaucrats to suppress the opposition among railroaders, Maggie Oliver, a spokesperson for the Port, said last month, “We are hopeful that these negotiations will soon lead to a resolution with minimal disruption in service.”

Emphasizing the impact a national rail strike would have on the Port, and the inevitable reverberations of a strike resonating with dockworkers, Driscoll said that a rail strike “would be impactful, obviously, because rail—we have nine railroads that touch the port.” In case of a strike, he added that products would not be able to be moved “until the rails are back online.”

Right-wing US Senator Tommy Tuberville, one of the many federal backers of the Alabama-USA Corridor development project, stated last month that “the [dock] unions need to work this out,” echoing Biden and his Labor Secretary Marty Walsh that a strike on the railroads would be “unfathomable.”

Because of the inextricable interconnections between logistics, shipping and transportation industries, and therefore the direct interdependency between strikes in these industries, the sentiments of the ruling class towards a rail strike are identical to those of a potential dockworkers strike: It must be prevented at all costs so as to protect the profits of Wall Street.

These sentiments are shared by the union bureaucracy. For example, Alabama AFL-CIO Executive Board member Daryl Dewberry, formerly United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) District 20 vice president, is currently fulfilling his second term on the Alabama Port Authority’s Board of Directors. Given the UMWA’s ruthless isolation and suppression of the Warrior Met strike in Brookwood, which began in April 2021 after UMWA members rejected a wage-cutting tentative agreement proffered to them by the bureaucrats by a staggering margin, 1,006 to 45 , there is no doubt that Dewberry is working hand-in-glove with the ILA to prevent any word about a potential strike escaping the Port of Mobile.

The ILA, for its part, has maintained radio silence since announcing the strike deadline. Sitting on $82 million in assets, the ILA has more than enough in membership dues money to comfortably fund a powerful strike not only in Mobile, but accompanying actions by all of its members throughout North America in solidarity with Local 1410.

Dockworkers must be on guard against any attempt to keep them on the job past the deadline without a contract which meets their demands. This means developing organizational structures organized by the rank and file to enforce democratic control of their struggle.

The membership’s rejection of the union-backed contract proposal is part of a growing wave of opposition to sellout contracts brought forward by the union bureaucracy, including in votes of machinists and maintenance workers on the railroads. At WestRock’s Mahrt Mill paper mill in Cottonton, Alabama, around 500 United Steelworkers members are entering their third week of a lockout after rejecting a contract for the second time on October 1.

It is to their fellow members in the ILA and ILWU, as well as to their brothers and sisters in rail, coal and auto that Port of Mobile workers must turn outwards to and link up with for the purpose of carrying out a combined struggle against the companies for better wages and safer working conditions if their struggle is not to be isolated and betrayed by the union apparatus.",Q4

Varun Manish Chheda was killed on Wednesday allegedly by his 22-year-old roommate who is in under police custody for investigation. ""The 20-year-old Indian-American student was killed in a dorm by a roommate at Purdue University. Varun Manish Cheeda, a senior at Purdue University, from Indianapolis, died of `multiple sharp force traumatic injuries` in his dorm. Attack was unprovoked and senseless,"" the office said. Chheda was a 2020 graduate of Park Tudor, as per the Fox59, a tv station. Chheda`s roommate, 22-year-old Ji Min ""Jimmy"" Sha, from Korea is now in police custody and is the prime suspect in the case.

She is a junior cybersecurity major and international student from Korea. At 12:45 am on Wednesday Sha called 911 to alert police about the death, Purdue University Police Chief Lesley Wiete said during a news conference Wednesday morning, reported NBC. However, no further details of the call and how the victim died in his room on the first floor of McCutcheon Hall were disclosed. The police are treating the death as a homicide case. According to the Police Chief, the suspect has not been booked yet. She said that at the time of the 911 call, only Chheda and Sha were in the room at the time.

According to its website, Purdue has about 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students enrolled for the fall semester incident that happened, media reports said.""I write to let you know that early this morning, one of our students was killed in his residence hall room.

We do not have all the details yet, he added and said that Purdue University Police Department is conducting a thorough investigation of this incident so that they can learn more about what transpired.

Purdue`s president assured us that the safety and security of students are the single highest priority on the campus. ""Purdue is an extraordinarily safe place on any given day, and compared with cities of Purdue`s population (approximately 60,000 in all), we experience a tiny fraction of violent and property crime that occurs elsewhere.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1727980/coas-visits-frontline-troops-in-miramshah-tarbela,"COAS visits frontline troops in Miramshah, Tarbela","PESHAWAR: Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Asim Munir visited Miramshah and Tarbela on Friday, a statement issued by the military’s media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.

The army chief laid a floral wreath at the martyrs’ monument and paid homage to brave soldiers who laid down their lives while defending the motherland, the statement added.

The army chief also visited frontline tro­ops deployed along the Pak-Afghan border and commended the professionalism, mor­ale and operational readiness of the force.

The COAS was briefed by field commanders on the latest security situation in the area and the response mechanisms to counter terrorist threats.

Hails the ‘sacrifices’ of SSG commandos

“Pakistan Army remains focused on the evolving security situation and determined to take the battle to the terrorists and break nexus with their facilitators so as to ensure lasting peace through socio-economic development,” the statement quoted the COAS as saying.

“Pakistan Army will consolidate the hard-earned peace, made possible by the supreme sacrifices of the resilient nation and law enforcement agencies,” the statement added.

Later, Gen Munir also visited the Special Services Group’s (SSG) headquarters and met officers and soldiers including the elite Zarrar company, whose soldiers carried out the operation at the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) centre in Bannu.

The COAS praised the “indomitable spi­rit, sacrifices and commitment to the duty” of SSG personnel, the statement read.

“SSG is the pride of the nation and it has proved its mettle over the years,” the statement quoted Gen Munir as saying.

Upon his arrival, the COAS was received by Commander Peshawar Corps Lt Gen Hassan Azhar Hayat.

The army chief’s visit has come at a time when Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s districts, esp­ecially tribal areas bordering Afghanistan are seeing a surge in terrorist attacks.

Last week, terrorists from the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan took security personnel hostage after taking over the CTD centre in Bannu.

After a 48-hour-long standoff, the centre was cleared by SSG commandos who eliminated all terrorists.

In another attack on Dec 14, three civilians were killed and 14, including nine security personnel, were wounded in a suicide attack in the Sargardan area of North Waziristan.

For date nights, long meals in cozy dining rooms, and multi-course feasts, these are the new full-service restaurants that wowed us in 2022. (Plus, 17 notable expansions and revamps.)

Devoted foodies and restaurant newbies love The Feed. Sign-up now for our twice weekly newsletter.

What a good year for eating. 2022 took us around the globe with new restaurants hyper-focused on regional cuisines previously underrepresented in Boston: We’ve now got a Yemeni restaurant in Kenmore Square, Yunnan cuisine (from southwestern China) in the South End, and an offshoot of Neapolitan pizza not previously available here. Greater Boston’s already impressive Peruvian and Thai scenes got even better, and we saw unique additions to the Japanese, Irish, and Sichuan Chinese scenes, too. And, because Boston loves seafood and Italian food, we got lots more of those.

This is part one of our year-end reminiscing about our favorite new openings of 2022; here, we focus on the sit-down restaurants—some casual (but with waiter service), some fine-dining, all delicious.

See also: Our favorite new fast-casual restaurants, bars, and bakeries and cafés of 2022.

Bab Al-Yemen

This Kenmore Square spot is one of the only Yemeni restaurants in the region, and it happily fills that niche with roasted meats, warming stews, and absolutely enormous pieces of fresh bread. Our top pick is the lamb haneeth, slow-roasted and spiced lamb served with rice, which is garnished with fried onions. Start with lentil soup—livened up with a squeeze of lemon—and end with a glass of adani tea, a milky tea spiced with wintery flavors like cloves and cardamom.

468 Commonwealth Ave., Kenmore Square, Boston, 857-250-2943, babalyemenboston.com.

Batifol

Call it a clichéd order, but we fell in love with a dinner of French onion soup, steak frites, and a nice glass of red. It was a perfect combination on that recent December evening with Greater Boston’s first bit of real snowfall. Batifol, from the Petit Robert Bistro team, opened in Kendall Square this fall, and it serves the kind of French food Cambridge needs. You’ll find the classics, sure, but you’ll also find cashew-crusted red perch in a Thai-style red curry or fried cauliflower with capers and saffron aioli—and you’ll eat it all in a trendy, comfortable space with Parisian subway vibes.

291 Third St., Kendall Square, Cambridge, 617-945-0345, batifolcambridge.com.

BoonNoon Market

This tiny Thai restaurant and market only has a few tables, but settle in for a meal and you’ll be happy you did. The staff is extraordinarily friendly, and you’ll want to take some time to browse the market shelves while you wait for your food. (Anything from Thai cutlery to packaged noodles to dried herbs might be there.) We love the northern Thai dishes on the menu—ua lao (sausage) and khao soi—and the peanutty spicy satay noodles are a fun pick, too. Or just go for whatever’s on special that day; there’s always something exciting.

161 Massachusetts Ave., Arlington, 781-316-0059, boonnoonmarket.com.

Bosso Ramen Tavern

One chilly, rainy Tuesday night this fall, we were delighted to find Bosso jam-packed and lively. This restaurant is just plain fun. And the menu isn’t limited to ramen, despite the name (although the ramen is very good and worth ordering!): There’s also sushi (big pieces closer in style to temaki than neatly wrapped maki), creative small plates with a seafood focus, sake-based cocktails, and more.

24 Holyoke St., Harvard Square, Cambridge, 857-999-6867, bossoramentavern.com.

The Dubliner

This sprawling modern Irish restaurant in City Hall’s shadow features everything you’d want from an Irish pub: live music, plenty of Guinness, and hearty portions of entrees like fish and chips or shepherd’s pie. But chef and partner Aidan McGee, whose resumé includes stints at Michelin-starred restaurants in Great Britain, is kicking things up a notch with dishes like roast pork for two and an elegant seafood chowder. Don’t miss the Sunday roast.

2 Center Plz., Downtown Boston, 857-317-2695, thedublinerboston.com.

Faccia a Faccia

The latest bit of magic from restaurateurs Ken Oringer and Jamie Bissonnette is Faccia a Faccia—née Faccia Brutta but quickly changed due to a challenge from a similarly named amaro brand in New York. The Newbury Street restaurant highlights that vague genre of “coastal Italian” that tends to include lots of seafood. (Or, as our critic Jolyon Helterman put it in a September review, the place has a “sprawling Italian-ish menu with … Mediterranean flair (harissa, saffron, etc.)” And, as he notes, Faccia Brutta usually nails it, with “terrific” food and “polished” recipes. Try the ruby red prawn crudo or grilled lobster with clams and chili butter.

278 Newbury St., Back Bay, Boston, 857-991-1080, facciaafacciaboston.com.

La Royal

The Celeste team can do no wrong, and their second local restaurant—third if you count Vermont as local—is another winner. (Esquire agrees.) This hip, hospitable Cambridge spot, tucked away in quiet Huron Village, features Peruvian dishes from all over the country—whether you’re looking for an Amazonian fish dish or a northern rice and duck combo. And there’s plenty of pisco to go around.

221 Concord Ave., Cambridge, 617-823-1595, laroyalcambridge.com.

Lenox Sophia

Head to the pint-sized former KO Pies space in Southie for an impeccable five-course tasting menu of what the Lenox Sophia team simply describes as “modern American fare.” That might mean plump king trumpets brought into another plane of existence with honey fermented garlic, elderflower miso, and dried plum. Or perhaps it means a homey pile of tagliatelle smothered in a mountain of grated truffles. Whatever it means, bring your own wine: Lenox Sophia has an extraordinarily-rare-for-Boston BYOB license.

87 A St., South Boston, 617-597-2170, lenoxsophia.com.

Little Tao

Chef Tao Liu hails from Chengdu in China’s Sichuan province and brings a flavor-packed taste of Sichuan cuisine to this tiny Allston space. The restaurant does plenty of takeout and delivery, but you’ll want to dine in to enjoy the showstopper fresh: the smoky tea-flavored half duck. The Tao Tao noodles—minced pork, chickpeas, and chili sauce—are another must-try.

1153 Commonwealth Ave., Allston, Boston, 617-207-2781, mylittletao.com.

Moëca

Boston loves seafood, and Boston loves Italian food, so why not a new seafood restaurant from the team behind an Italian favorite? The Giulia folks opened Moëca right around the corner this year, aimed at highlighting seasonal, sustainable seafood dishes influenced by a variety of cuisines around the globe (not just Italian). Be sure to save room for pastry chef Renae Connolly’s always-amazing desserts.

1 Shepard St., Cambridge, 617-945-0040, moecarestaurant.com.

Pescador

Speaking of seafood: Enter Pescador. This is the second of three restaurants to open in Kenmore Square from New York’s Blue Ribbon Restaurants group, and it’s a new concept for the company, featuring a seafood-focused menu drawing inspiration from coastal cuisines in Central and Latin America, Spain, Portugal, and beyond. Our early favorites are the head-on shrimp with Baja butter and the corn “ribs”—and don’t miss the extensive selection of agave spirits.

498 Commonwealth Ave., Kenmore Square, Boston, 617-532-1050, pescadorkenmore.com.

Si Cara

From SRV’s Michael Lombardi comes a cozy, date-night, pizza-and-wine spot in Central Square, featuring a pizza genre new to Boston: canotto-style. It’s like Neapolitan, but with an extra-puffy crust, and Lombardi embellishes it with creative topping combos, like mushrooms with taleggio and leek kimchi. Pair it with a big glass of natural wine. Try the garlic bread and arancini, too.

425 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, 617-945-7629, sicarapizza.com.

Thonglor

There’s lots to enjoy at this comfortable new Thai restaurant and bar in Brighton’s Oak Square (located in the former Twelve Hours space). Start with the crab fried rice and the tum tard, grilled pork with herb sauce, papaya salad, and sticky rice.

559 Washington St., Brighton, Boston, 617-208-8184, toasttab.com/thonglor.

Tonino

Neighborhood vibes, an intimate space, hearty bowls of pasta: What could be better? Try to reserve a spot at the two-seat chef’s counter for a front-row view of the kitchen, and start with the littleneck clams with guanciale, Calabrian chili, garlic, and basil (and plenty of bread for dipping into the remaining broth)—it’s one of our favorite dishes of the year. Next: any pasta. You can’t go wrong.

669 Centre St., Jamaica Plain, Boston, 617-524-9217, toninojp.com.

Yunnan Kitchen

We can’t get enough of this South End newcomer, one of Boston’s only tastes of Yunnan (or Dian) cuisine from China’s southwest. Must-tries include the crispy Dali fried pea jelly, wood ear mushroom salad, mint beef, and sticky rice pancakes with condensed milk. The food here is quite unlike most of the regional Chinese cuisines that Boston’s more familiar with, and you’re going to want to get to know it.

1721B Washington St., South End, Boston, 617-936-4123, yunnankitchensouthend.com.

Notable Expansions and Revamps

These full-service stunners aren’t complete newcomers; they merely expanded or changed in 2022. But they’re worth a mention—and definitely worth a visit.

Barcelona Wine Bar: This growing national chain has quite a hold on Boston, with long-running Brookline and South End locations always drawing crowds. This year, an already-bustling Harvard Square location joined the mix.

Even if the withdrawal of Mir will impact the Turkish economy, it prefers not to anger the Biden administration, according to experts telling Sputnik.

US Doubles Down on Imperatives

Russia has been developing alternative means to drop the US dollar and western currencies with a native system for banking, reported Sputnik News.

Several monetary systems are the System for Transfer of Financial Messages (STFM) and the Mir Card for credit and debit. In 2019, Turkish banks used it to facilitate transactions between Russian tourists for goods and services, noted Windobi.

In the middle of September, the US treasury threatened all banking systems, even those outside of the US, as subject to its blanket ban on the Mir card outside Russia.

The US has placed secondary sanctions to stop other nations from dealing with Moscow; some of these institutions are banks in Turkey. One of these institutions is the Ziraat Bank, which told the outlet it was coerced by sanctions to sever itself from the Russian banking system.

One of these specialists, Gareth Jenkins, who is connected to several institutions, is studying the impact of such blanket bans via US-authored sanctions. He added that the economic effect of the pullout from Russia's Mir payment systems would then presumably be less than if it had occurred during the summer when a lot of Russian tourists had been touring Turkey.

Furthermore, many Russians in Turkey are going to visit, and the cessation of Mir would make it more difficult for many to make payments, citing YRT News.

Moscow, Turkey Relations

Moscow and Turkey have had good relations as co-partners in critical areas where they both benefit, but it has not always been smooth sailing.

One example is Washington, which has not approved its link with Moscow, but the last straw for the Biden administration is seeing President Tayyip Erdogan do a tightrope.

By this, it means not condemning Russian President Vladimir Putin for the special operation in Ukraine. The US government does not want Turkey to have an independent stance, hence the threat of secondary sanctions if the Mir card remains.

Jenkin mentioned that Moscow knows the Turkish leader must have a link to Russia, especially with the state of the economy. He remarked that angering Putin is more important than concerning itself with what Joe Biden thinks at times.

Due to sanctions, Turkey appears to be ready to abandon the Mir system; how to keep the economic link intact to ward off rash punitive actions.

Jenkins explained how to have an alternative to the Russian system, claiming that Erdogan will struggle to find something as good as Mir. Furthermore, the US will intimidate leaders like him into forcing the country to follow the White House's lead.

Another is that Erdogan is facing another election this coming June, and the crisis will have an opening to lessen his chances of re-election.

Ankara is squished by US intent for it to abandon Russia's mir payment systems by the US-authored sanctions, which is illegal according to some sectors, but no one stops Washington.",Q4

https://wgrd.com/michigan-produces-cucumber-pickles/,Love Pickles? Michigan Produces More Than Any Other State,"The Mitten never ceases to amaze me! Despite having been born and raised in West Michigan and having lived here the majority of my life, I'm always amazed at just how much I'm still discovering about my home state.

Upon recently learning that Michigan is the 3rd largest supplier of Christmas trees in the nation I also stumbled upon the fact that one of Michigan's most impressive exports is not in fact automobiles-- it's pickles!

Get our free mobile app

Well, cucumbers to be more specific.

The Michigan History group on Facebook shared more on Michigan's pickle industry saying,

We're #1 - Michigan's more dominant in pickle packing than in auto making. Michigan factories build about one U.S. motor vehicle in four, but we pack one of every three pickles...Michigan's in a pickle and we love it!

Why Michigan?

According to the original post, both the climate and the sandy soil here in the Great Lakes State make this the perfect place for cucumbers to thrive. The State of Michigan says in 2016 alone 236,700 tons of pickling cucumbers were produced here; a value of $47 million!

In addition, Michigan produced 68 million pounds of cucumbers to supply fresh markets throughout the country.

How Are Pickles Made?

You may just be learning that pickles are in fact made with cucumbers. They're so easy to make that many people opt to make them in their own homes! Most recipes require a combination of spices, water, and vinegar to ferment the cucumbers and prevent spoilage. Easy as that!

Michigan-based Brands

While corporations like Kraft-Heinz operate the “world's largest pickle and vinegar processing plant"" in Holland, there are many mom-and-pop brands that can be found on store shelves across the state.

Popular Michigan pickle brands include Freestone Pickle from Bangor, Bay City's Hausbeck Pickles, and Swanson Pickles in Ravenna. Vlasic even got its start in Detroit!

https://news.yahoo.com/just-mutilated-parents-san-antonio-211529719.html,'He’s just mutilated': Parents of San Antonio teen shot in McDonald's parking lot say every day is a struggle,"The parents of Erik Cantu, the 17-year-old boy who was shot by a San Antonio police officer in the parking lot of a McDonald's, said the last three weeks have been a ""horrific roller coaster"" as their son continues to fight for his life.

""He's just mutilated, and it hurts us to see our son that way,"" his mother, Victoria Casarez, said at a news conference Tuesday.

His father, Eric Cantu, said that the situation is ""very touch and go"" and that Cantu recently developed pneumonia, which complicated his progress.

It was the first time Cantu's parents have publicly spoken about the Oct. 2 shooting, when Officer James Brennand opened fire on the teen. Brennand has been fired and charged with aggravated assault.

Police body camera video showed that Cantu was in a maroon vehicle in the restaurant's parking lot when Brennand yanked the driver's door open and ordered him to get out.

Cantu was in the driver's seat eating a hamburger, and a 17-year-old girl was in the passenger seat.

Cantu put the car in reverse with the driver’s door still open and backed up. Capt. Alyssa Campos, the police department’s training commander, said in a video statement that the door hit Brennand.

Brennand opened fire five times as the car reversed, the video showed. He fired five more shots as Cantu drove away. Cantu was found about a block away suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. He remains in the hospital on life support.

""Erik is not our Erik,"" his father said, adding that Cantu underwent a tracheotomy and is on heavy medication. ""As the doctors try to wean him off these things in the last few days, it doesn't seem to counteract as the way we anticipated. Therefore, those little steps we see daily, we just keep going back.""

Cantu's parents said they believe he was shot four times. His mother said all of the bullets have been removed except one that remains lodged near his heart.

""They're unable to get that out right now. It would do more harm than good,"" she told reporters.

Police said that Brennand was called to McDonald’s on Blanco Road for an unrelated disturbance call and approached Cantu's car because he believed it had evaded him the day before when he tried to conduct a traffic stop. Campos said Brennand thought the car was stolen, a claim the family denies.

Attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing the family, said Brennand racially profiled Cantu and ""thought he had the right to just eviscerate the Constitution."" Partner attorney Paul Grinke said they plan to look into policies and training at the San Antonio Police Department.

At the time of the shooting, Brennand had been on the force for seven months and was still on probation, a standard practice for San Antonio officers who graduated from the police academy less than a year ago.

https://newrepublic.com/article/168163/world-war-crushed-american-left-adam-hochschild-book-review,How World War I Crushed the American Left,"But why did that dream have such a powerful hold on these men, even to the point of turning their own countrymen into enemies? Hochschild cites the significant change in gender roles and the labor market in the 50 years leading up to World War I—particularly the marked rise in women’s workforce participation, and the concurrent rise in the (still very low) divorce rate. Modern, self-supporting, marriage-eschewing women were “as much of a threat to the traditional order as immigrants, socialists, and Blacks.” The appeal of war, with its rigid reinforcing of the gender binary, is therefore obvious.

It’s also somewhat reductive. Women had, after all, been openly agitating for their rights since the middle of the nineteenth century. Why did their demands seem so threatening in this moment? One explanation is that in the decade prior to World War I, suffragists became far more vocal and visible, taking to the streets and—especially in New York—explicitly linking their cause to the fights for labor rights, racial justice, and world peace. Suddenly, women were demanding not just the vote but a wholesale reorganization of society, under the banner of a new idea, “feminism,” which was firmly linked to socialism in this era. Accordingly, Hochschild observes, “many of the antiwar dissidents who provoked the most male rage were women.” Emma Goldman—who embodied the worst fears of many men about leftists and feminists—was eventually deported to her native Russia in 1919, under the watchful eye of a rising young functionary in the Bureau of Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover. Hochschild also threads through the book the experiences of Kate Richards O’Hare, a flame-haired Socialist party speaker and activist who was quickly indicted under the Espionage Act and befriended Goldman in prison. But Hochschild gives other important women short shrift. He mentions Crystal Eastman, for instance, only as the sister of Max and his co-editor on the left-wing magazine The Liberator, without noting her role as a major figure in the peace movement. Nor, in a mention of the ACLU further down the same page, does Hochschild identify her as one of the founders of that organization. His previous book was a biography of the extremely famous Socialist turned Communist Rose Pastor Stokes, a friend of Eastman’s, so it is possible he doesn’t want to revisit her story in a different account of the same historical period, but without a fuller picture of the role of women in these years, the argument about the fundamental misogyny of the moment feels less convincing.

Most strikingly, Hochschild does not discuss the way the government treated suffrage leader Alice Paul and members of the National Woman’s Party between 1917 and 1920, an important illustration of how a crackdown on public protest could quickly morph into a wholesale violation of Americans’ constitutional rights. Starting on January 10, 1917, Paul and her allies mounted a months-long vigil at the White House gates, silently and obstinately repudiating Wilson’s claims to be a safeguard of democracy. If women couldn’t vote, how could the U.S. claim to be a democracy itself? Their protests escalated after police started arresting and jailing the women for blocking the sidewalk. According to one NWP member who wrote a detailed account of their campaign, Paul and her allies lobbied to be treated as political prisoners—only for the authorities to refuse, on the grounds that there was no such thing in America.",Q4

Kathy Hochul on Friday said.

A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked some aspects of the law, including requirements for licensing and restrictions on where guns can be carried in areas deemed to be sensitive. The injunction takes effect in several days and state officials are appealing.

""We believe the governor should have the right that was in place for 108 years to protect the citizens of our state,"" Hochul said during a stop in Rochester. ""When the Supreme Court struck down the entire law, we knew we could continue to work. Whether it's on this law or entire gun laws, I believe people in this state deserve to be protected.""

The law was approved earlier this summer in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling that found New York's strict concealed carry law was unconstitutional. The new measure is facing multiple legal challenges, including one from upstate churches who are contesting a ban on guns in houses of worship.

U.S. District Court Judge Glenn Suddaby's ruling allows people will allow guns in houses of worship if the person is a designated security officer.

""In time, we expect to see even greater relief from the courts,"" said the Rev. Jason McGuire, the executive director of New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms. ""For now, we are thankful that a court has recognized that church leaders must be free to provide for the safety of their flocks.”

Suddaby's ruling suspends provisions in the law that require potential licenseholders to submit up to three years of social media posts, prove they have a good moral character and release names of close family members. The judge also lifted restrictions on carrying guns on non-government property like Times Square.

The ruling was made in a lawsuit brought by the Gun Owners of America, which is seeking a broader challenge to the law.",Q4
https://news.yahoo.com/what-early-abortions-actually-look-like-234132254.html,Here's what pregnancy actually looks like before 10 weeks. Experts explain why we don't see these images more often.,"Photos of what pregnancy tissue from early abortions at 5 to 9 weeks actually looks like have gone viral.

The images, which were originally shared by MYA Network — a network of physicians who provide early abortion services — and published in the Guardian, look like small clusters of white tissue and are vastly different from what most people typically see online. The photos have, unsurprisingly, elicited strong reactions.

Feminist author Jessica Valenti came under fire for sharing the images on her TikTok, with people calling her “a liar” and the photos “fake” because, as Valenti shared on TikTok, “it doesn’t align with what they’ve been taught an abortion and a pregnancy is.”

However, several others tweeted about the importance of seeing photos like these. “We need to change the images we use when we talk about abortion,” one user tweeted, while another wrote after seeing the photos: “It’s comforting and empowering.”

Dr. Joan Fleischman, a family medicine physician and abortion care provider for 25 years, who co-founded MYA Network and gathered the tissues, tells Yahoo Life that a lot of imagery of early pregnancy is “fully inaccurate.”

Women’s health expert Dr. Jennifer Wider tells Yahoo Life that “weeks 5 to 9 is the early time period in a pregnancy. At 5 weeks, the embryo is a mass of cells with a developing neural tube (pre-spinal cord and brain). The forming fetus is no larger than a grain of rice.”

‘I had no idea it looked like this’

Fleischman tells Yahoo Life that she uses a manual aspiration device for abortion procedures, noting it’s a “very delicate device so the tissue does come out quite intact,” as pictured in the photos. She adds: “Everyone has had the same response, which is, ‘I had no idea it looked like this’ because that cultural imagery is unchallenged.”

Some social media users questioned why there wasn’t any blood in the images, while several claimed that the embryo must have been removed from the photos. However, Fleischman explains that the blood has been rinsed off and what remains is the gestational sac and the nascent (that is, just coming into existence) embryo, stating that there is no visible embryo at this stage.

“I’ve never seen an embryo at 9 weeks because of the size,” she says, adding that it would have to be magnified and noting that around 9 1/2 weeks you do start to see an embryo with the naked eye.

Because of the blowback from sharing these images, Fleischman says she commissioned a report from a pathologist to review them. In the report shared on Twitter by Guardian writer Poppy Noor, the pathologist, Dr. Emily Ryan, a clinical instructor in gynecological pathology at Stanford, wrote: “These photos are good examples of what we as pathologists see when looking at curettage specimens. In evaluating pregnancy tissue 9 weeks and under, the tissue is nebulous and identifiable embryos are usually not seen.”

Fleischman says the image of tissue from an abortion at 6 weeks in particular is “profound,” since that is when Texas and Oklahoma’s abortion bans start. The Texas abortion ban has been called “the heartbeat bill,” which experts have called medically inaccurate. According to MYA Network, “There is no ‘heart’ at 6 weeks of pregnancy, but there are cells that will come together to form the heart, and those cells already ‘beat.’ This is the motion that is seen on ultrasound and that people refer to as a ‘heartbeat,’ but again there is not yet a formed heart.”

She shares that some patients in need of abortion care come into her office “with so much heaviness,” but if they see what the tissue actually looks like after an abortion, they feel “100% percent relief.” Fleischman adds: “It’s a huge weight lifted.”

Why do people rarely see images like these?

“It’s a perfect demonstration of choosing images that advance your own perspective,” says Fleischman. She explains that when people are excited about their pregnancy, they want to see babylike images, noting that it’s “incredible when you’re excited and seeing that imagery and what’s going on on this day. They’re used medically to inspire people to take care of themselves.”

However, Fleischman says the anti-abortion-rights movement has “really used” similar babylike images “so successfully in every aspect of what they do. They’ve really dominated what’s on the internet.”

Wider agrees, saying: “For some people, picturing a babylike image makes the idea of terminating a pregnancy unacceptable — [but] at this early stage the embryo does not resemble a baby yet.”

The overturning of Roe v. Wade, followed by abortion bans being triggered in several states across the U.S., inspired Fleischman to share these images. “When the criminality of abortion started to happen I was like, ‘This imagery needs to be known publicly,’” she says.

Fleischman says that while some will doubt the authenticity of these images, she hopes that seeing them will cause people to “really grapple” with what they thought early abortions looked like. “How does this change how you feel? Nobody seems to be asking that question,” she says. “If you really let [these images] sink in, does that then impact your sense of denying this right to people?”

However, Wider acknowledges these images may not change the minds of people who are against abortion. “I’m not sure it changes the pro-life vs. pro-choice argument, because it really centers around the fundamental difference of when does life begin — many pro-life people feel it begins at conception,” she says.

The legislation would block all transactions from any social media company in or under the influence of China and Russia, Rubio's office said in a news release, adding that a companion bill in the US House of Representatives was sponsored by Republican congressman Mike Gallagher and Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi.

""It is troubling that rather than encouraging the administration to conclude its national security review of TikTok, some members of Congress have decided to push for a politically-motivated ban that will do nothing to advance the national security of the United States,"" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the company would continue to brief members of Congress on the plans that are ""well underway"" to ""further secure our platform in the United States.""

The bill comes as scrutiny of TikTok has grown in Washington in recent weeks, after a failed bid by the Trump administration to ban the video-sharing app.

Alabama and Utah on Monday joined other US states prohibiting the use of TikTok on state government devices and computer networks due to national security concerns. read more

In 2020, then-President Donald Trump attempted to block new users from downloading TikTok and ban other transactions that would have effectively blocked the apps' use in the United States but lost a series of court battles over the measure.

The US government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a powerful national security body, in 2020 ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok because of fears that US user data could be passed on to China's communist government.

Trump stumps for himself in final stretch of midterm election rallies

- United States presidents past and present campaigned through the weekend in key states, in a last push to get out the vote for their parties ahead of the Nov 8 midterm elections.

But competing rallies in one particular state stood out.

In Florida, former president Donald Trump and Republican Governor Ron DeSantis – who is running for re-election and widely expected to win – held separate rallies on Sunday.

Mr Trump may be beleaguered by a variety of investigations, but his shadow looms large over this election in which he has endorsed scores of candidates.

And he has been relentlessly teasing a comeback bid in 2024 and may announce it very soon.

The 76-year-old former president continues to insist that the 2020 election was stolen – and despite no evidence of that, a majority of Republicans believe him.

He is also clearly looking at the midterms as a stepping stone to retaking the White House in 2024.

Mr DeSantis, however, is seen as one of the few who will plausibly compete with Mr Trump for the Republican Party’s nomination.

At a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, Mr Trump gave his 44-year-old potential rival one of his signature derogatory nicknames, calling him “Ron DeSanctimonious” while preening at numbers on big TV screens that showed his own strong popularity within the party.

“We’re winning big in the Republican Party for the nomination like nobody’s ever seen before,” he said, referring to himself.

“There it is: Trump at 71 per cent, Ron DeSanctimonious at 10 per cent.”

A straw poll among attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference in August also revealed that Mr Trump had 69 per cent support to run in 2024. Mr DeSantis garnered just 24 per cent.

But there was backlash from some conservatives over Mr Trump’s remarks on Saturday, highlighting the coming dilemma for the party.

Conservative commentator Matt Walsh tweeted: “Nice job launching your public attack against the most popular conservative governor in America three days before the midterms, when we’re all supposed to be showing a united front.”

On Sunday at another rally in Florida – again with Mr DeSantis rallying separately elsewhere in the state – Mr Trump did not mention the nickname again, but asked supporters to vote for Mr DeSantis.

The campaign has been marked by heated rhetoric.

On Saturday at a rally in Illinois, President Joe Biden scoffed at protesters holding signs calling him a socialist.

“I love those signs when I came in – socialism. Give me a break. What idiots,” he said.

The Soufan Centre, a consultancy that focuses on security issues, on Monday warned that misinformation and disinformation narratives spreading online are suggesting that voters cannot trust the outcome of the election – and that if “their side” loses, the election has been “rigged” or “stolen”.

“There is a real risk of political violence leading up to, during, or following the midterm elections,” it said.

“In unregulated online forums, violent extremists – including adherents of white supremacy extremism, accelerationism, and neo-Nazism – are celebrating the potential distrust in democracy, convincing followers that ‘there is no political solution’ and that violence is the only way forward.”

https://menafn.com/1105087301/Islamabad-Braces-For-Imrans-Long-March,Islamabad Braces For Imran's Long March,"Islamabad, Oct 27 (IANS) A day after former Prime Imran Khan announced his much-awaited march on Islamabad which will commence from Lahore on Friday, the capital administration has stepped up preparations to counter the protest and multiple arrest teams have been formed to deal with the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) protesters.

Keanu Reeves is a beloved actor whose career spans decades. He is handsome, charming, and a famously good person.

He’s the rare sort of person with whom no one has any problem whatsoever.

Almost no one, that is.

Matthew Perry brings up Keanu multiple times in his memoir. Negatively. It genuinely sounds like he’s complaining that Keanu is still alive.

(Getty Images for Tribeca Film Festival)

Matthew Perry’s life, career, and public imagine have gone up and down over the years.

For better or for worse, the world best knows him for his role on Friends.

He has penned a memoir, Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing. But not all promo tours go as well as one might hope.

We’re sending Matthew Perry happy wishes. He underwent major surgery in the year of 2018.

As is so often the case, various outlets have released multiple excerpts of Perry’s book to the public.

In one moment in the book, Perry discusses his friendship with the late, great River Phoenix.

“River was a beautiful man, inside and out,” he praised. “Too beautiful for this world, it turned out.”

Until he was 8 years old, River Phoenix was also brought up in the Children of God. He and his sister, Rain, lived in poverty while they were involved with the cult, receiving no financial support from the group’s wealthy leader.

“It always seems to be the really talented guys who go down,” Perry lamented. That is a common sentiment.

“Why is it that the original thinkers like River Phoenix and Heath Ledger die,” he asked.

“But,” Perry expressed bizarrely, “Keanu Reeves still walks among us?”

There’s only one word for this old school Keanu photo: WHOA!

That’s an extremely weird, out-of-pocket comment.

It would be hostile to make about anyone. Like, you’re literally complaining that someone is alive. He could have at least made it about someone controversial, or better yet widely despised.

Instead, Perry complained about the life of one of the most altruistic, polite, universally adored actors on the planet.

Matthew Perry is pictured here in 2015. The actor has faced a number of issues in his personal life over the years.

As a one-off remark, that would be weird. Like, a bad example, dude — and weird to include in a memoir.

Like, people sometimes say things impulsively that sound insensitive. But books go through editing. That was a choice.

And it’s not a choice that Perry made only once. He said it again.

Chris Farley passed in his Chicago apartment on December 18, 1997. Later, medical examiners determined that Farley overdosed on a mixture of heroin, cocaine, and morphine.

In another portion of the memoir, Perry wrote about the death of the late, great Chris Farley.

“His disease had progressed faster than mine had. (Plus, I had a healthy fear of the word ‘heroin,’ a fear we did not share),” he wrote.

Perry went on: “I punched a hole through Jennifer Aniston’s dressing room wall when I found out. Keanu Reeves walks among us.”

Keanu Reeves attended a total of four different high-schools before being kicked out of the last one. He was quoted saying, “I was just a little too rambunctious and shot my mouth off once too often. I was not generally the most well-oiled machine in the school.”

For decades, Keanu has enjoyed a sterling reputation — not only for his public persona, but for his actions in his private life.

It’s not just that people who meet and work with him like him.

He is generous, even with total strangers. Keanu has very quietly transformed people’s lives. Because he’s a good dude.

So … what in the world is going on?

After accidentally becoming a strong contender for Main Character On Twitter this week (a title that you never want), he is trying to walk it back.

“I’m actually a big fan of Keanu,” Matthew Perry now claims to People.

Matthew Perry will always be Chandler Bing. We mean that as a compliment. What a funny character!

“I just chose a random name, my mistake,” Perry claimed.

“I apologize,” he said.

Perry then added, in a self-deprecatory tone: “I should have used my own name instead.”

Keanu Reeves is best known for his roles in major films including Speed, The Matrix, and Point Break, but he was also the bassist for the alternative rock band, “Dog Star,” until 2002.

We don’t know what beef, real or imagined, Perry may have with the beloved Keanu Reeves.

But he is wise to avoid doubling down on the one-sided loathing after getting ratioed into next week on social media.

Meanwhile, his gripe about Keanu still being alive is sort of funny.

Seriously. That is Keanu Reeves in 1875.

See, between his own tendency to not discernibly age and some pieces of historical art, there’s a mostly-joking theory that Keanu is immortal.

Now tempted to imagine a scenario where Matthew Perry is a longstanding enemy of Keanu’s. Instead of being a fellow immortal, he simply reincarnates with his memories while Keanu simply lives.

That would make more sense than whatever is really going on here.",Q4
https://www.sunjournal.com/2022/11/20/chapter-27-lowell-seeks-a-pardon/,Chapter 27: Lowell seeks a pardon,"In 1889, according to the Aug. 16 edition of the Portland Daily Press, James M. “Jim” Lowell wrote a letter to the secretary of state asking for a pardon “on the ground that his crime was only manslaughter.” It will be taken up by the governor and his council, the paper said.

In the letter, which “is causing no little sensation,” Lowell wrote, “I’ve been in prison 15 years, almost two terms for the crime I committed. I was convicted of willful murder. It is true my wife was killed while riding with me, but it was an accident it happened. If she had sat still on the seat instead of flying at me to pull my hair, she would have been living today, and I wouldn’t have been here.”

His plea, though, proved unconvincing.

Fortunately for Lowell, prison hadn’t proved an especially difficult place for him to remain.

In 1892, an account of some of the notorious inmates at the Maine State Prison mentioned that Lowell, “the Lewiston murderer, receives a liberal pension, which he spends for luxuries that are allowed. He has a special brand of cigars, manufactured in Rockland.”

One of the other prisoners, a forger, snagged the job of prison organist. He spent time composing “a stack of music, some of which he intends to publish after his release,” according to an account in the Feliciana Sentinel in St. Francisville, Louisiana.

In 1893, with growing support from community leaders in Lewiston, Lowell tried again for a pardon for his conviction of murdering his wife, Mary Elizabeth “Lizzie” Lowell in 1870.

“I have suffered 19 years for a crime I never committed,” Lowell wrote. “It may be I deserve punishment for concealing the truth at the time, but my life was at stake, and my punishment, I respectfully submit, has been ample for such a wrong,” Lowell wrote.

Lowell vowed that if free, he would “live an upright life” and “demonstrate by my life that I deserve my liberty and am not a murderer in thought or act, but am incapable of such a crime.”

Lowell’s attorney for the pardon push, Seth Carter of Auburn, argued that he ought to be freed because if Lowell’s later confession was accurate, his crime had been manslaughter, not murder.

The maximum imprisonment for a manslaughter conviction at the time was 10 years. Carter said that Lowell had been punished enough. But, again, the state refused.

Lowell tried once more in 1897.

Lowell told authorities that on the fateful ride with his wife, she flew at him and he pushed her back. She fell between the wheels of the buggy and broke her neck, he said, according to an account in the Daily Kennebec Journal.

“I placed her on a blanket,” he said. “My only thought was to get her where assistance could be given her. When I found that she was dead, I hid her remains, for a feared that I should be accused of murdering her.”

One of Lizzie’s sisters, identified as Mrs. C.H. Millett of Auburn, wrote to decision-makers, “I hope you will not pardon this man. He has said he will fix us all someday, and I believe 20 years or more in jail has done nothing to change him.”

“We are in constant fear all the time,” she wrote. “If he would murder one, he would murder all.”

“I beg of you to keep him where he is,” Millett told Gov. Llewellyn Powers.

Lowell got support from state prison wardens.

Warren Hinckley, a deputy warden, said Lowell had always been a well-behaved prisoner and “able in the harness trade.”

Ex-Warden Samuel Allen said he thought Lowell was not a killer. But, he said, long years behind bars “had impaired Lowell, mentally and physically.”

Reviewing the case, the Journal said few in Lewiston believed Lowell would menace the public peace if freed.

“What he would do in this world now, no one can fancy, helpless, friendless and penniless, as he probably is,” the paper said.

Officials were not convinced he should go free.

But Lowell had more luck in 1899, a full quarter century after he first walked into the state prison as a convicted killer.

With attorney Daniel McGillicuddy, a future congressman, taking the lead, a number of well-known figures in Lewiston and Auburn got behind the push to let Lowell enjoy freedom again.

They presented a petition with nearly 1,800 names on it of people in Androscoggin County who endorsed the move.

U.S. Sen. William Frye, who had met with Lowell before his 1874 conviction, wrote a letter saying he had never believed that Lowell intended to kill his wife.

Probably most significantly, lawyer George Wing, who had helped to prosecute Lowell, wrote that the man might be free now had he only told the truth in the courtroom.

Judge Albion Knowlton, the man who once told an officer to bring Lowell back to Lewiston from Massachusetts, also said he never thought the convicted killer had set out to murder his wife.

Manslaughter should have been the charge from the beginning, Knowlton said.

Members of the grand jury and others who played a role in the case also urged leniency toward Lowell, saying he’d served long enough for the crime he committed.

O.J. Douglas of Lewiston said that Lowell’s attorney told him years earlier that his client had privately confessed to pushing Lizzie off the wagon. He said that Lowell, though, didn’t want to admit it in court.

Capt. A.P. Ham said that Lowell had been “a first-class soldier” during the Civil War and that ought to mean something.

County Attorney George McCann said, however, that Lowell was “a man of low character” and that he was guilty of murder and ought to suffer the full consequences. He resolutely opposed offering Lowell a pardon.

McGillicuddy said the bottom line is that Lowell served a decade for manslaughter and then another 15 years, entirely unnecessarily, for perjury.

After hearing the competing claims, Gov. Llewellyn Powers’ Executive Committee urged the governor to grant the long-sought pardon.

The Lewiston Daily Sun reported on Nov. 15, 1899, that Powers had signed the pardon.

It said that Lowell, 58, had learned the painting and harness making trades in prison and would likely be able to pursue them in the outside world.

It took another day for the prison and Lowell to work out all the necessary logistics for his release, from collecting his prison pay to finding him some clothing for the outside world.

And then, the prison let him go.

Kanye has been seen with Juliana on several occasions these last few days.

The rapper and the model were seen checking into a hotel together in Beverly Hills on Thursday, and grabbing dinner on Saturday night at Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica.

The sightings came several days before Kanye sparked outrage for posting an anti-Semitic tweet against the Jewish community.

The blowback from A-listers came as both Twitter and Instagram face huge criticism at their apparent reluctance to delete anti-Semitic comments from the site.

West was barred from posting on his Twitter account after the shocking threats - just hours after being restricted on Instagram.

In a post, that has since been removed by Twitter, Kanye wrote: 'I'm a bit sleepy tonight but when I wake up I'm going death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE.'

He added: 'The funny thing is I actually can't be Anti Semitic because black people are actually Jew also.

Controversy: The sightings came several days before Kanye sparked outrage for posting an anti-Semitic tweet against the Jewish community

'You guys have toyed with me and tried to black ball anyone whoever opposes your agenda.'

Jamie Lee Curtis spoke about the timing of West's words, coming a week after Yom Kippur, adding: 'Words matter. A threat to Jewish people ended once in a genocide.'

Comedian Sarah Silverman and Frozen star Josh Gad have come forward to denounce Kanye's anti-Semitic Twitter outburst.

Silverman, 51, tweeted: 'Kanye threatened the Jews yesterday on twitter and it’s not even trending. Why do mostly only Jews speak up against Jewish hate? The silence is so loud.'

Hours after posting, West was locked out of his Twitter account - as Jewish celebrities and politicians condemned him for the vile online abuse.

A Twitter spokesman said of West's remarks: 'The account in question has been locked due to a violation of Twitter's policies.' This means that the rapper will be unable to post.",Q4

MONROE COUNTY, Miss. (WCBI) – The Monroe County Sheriff’s Department has settled a lawsuit filed by the family of a man killed during a drug raid in 2015.

The family of Ricky Keeton had sued the county, over the death of Keeton, who was shot after he reportedly pointed a gun at officers who were serving a “no-knock” warrant.

Earlier this month it was announced that attorneys for the insurance company representing Monroe County had agreed to settle the suit for $690,000.

Jim Waide, the attorney representing the Keeton family, said the county’s use of “no knock” warrants was unnecessary and posed significant dangers to the public.

Deputies who were on the scene that night said they identified themselves as law officers that evening, as the raid started. Keeton was shot after deputies said he appeared at the door, pointing a handgun at them, and firing. The weapon was later determined to be a pellet gun, equipped with a tactical light.

“It is our common practice, once we get to the porch, start the breaching process, sometimes we announce before, that night, once we got to the porch, some started announcing, I started announcing once I got the door open,” said Monroe County Captain John Bishop.

“They may be yelling sheriff’s office, at the time but it can’t be heard over all the commotion going on. So homeowner such as Ricky Keeton wakes up, thinks somebody is breaking into his home, and does the natural thing that 90% of Mississippians would do. Go to the door armed,” said Keeton family attorney Jim Waide.

A special Grand Jury cleared all officers involved in the Keeton raid of any wrongdoing. At the time of the Keeton incident, Cecil Cantrell was sheriff of Monroe County.

The official settlement and indemnification agreement can be found here.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/12/06/jamal-khashoggi-death-lawsuit-mbs/,U.S. judge dismisses lawsuit against Saudi crown prince over Khashoggi’s death,"Despite “credible allegations” of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s involvement in the 2018 killing of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. federal judge on Tuesday ordered a lawsuit against the Saudi royal to be dismissed. The basis for the decision, wrote Judge John D. Bates of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, was the legal protections the prince is entitled to in his new role as Saudi Arabia’s prime minister.

“The United States has informed the court that he is immune, and Mohammed is therefore ‘entitled to head of state immunity … while he remains in office,’” Bates wrote in the Tuesday filing, which also dismissed the claims against two senior Saudi officials due to a lack of adequate proof in establishing the court’s jurisdiction over their case.

Last month, the Biden administration determined that Mohammed — also known as MBS — was immune from the suit brought forth in 2020 by Khashoggi’s fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, and the civil rights organization he founded before his death, Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), given his appointment as “sitting head of government.” On Sept. 27, Mohammed was named prime minister by his father, King Salman — just six days before the U.S. State Department’s court-imposed deadline to determine whether Mohammed was protected from legal action.

On Oct. 2, 2018, Saudi agents killed Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. What has been done in the aftermath? (Video: Joyce Lee, Thomas LeGro, Dalton Bennett, John Parks/The Washington Post)

The move was decried by DAWN as a “last ditch effort to escape the jurisdiction of the court.”

“DAWN’s lawsuit against [Mohammed] bin Salman (MBS) for his ruthless murder of Jamal Khashoggi is only one part of our continued efforts for justice and accountability for this crime, and the many other crimes the Saudi government is perpetrating against its own citizens,” Sarah Leah Whitson, the organization’s executive director, said in a statement. “While we are disappointed in the decision, we will consider all options to continue our legal challenges to MBS’s criminal behavior.”

Mohammed has said he takes responsibility for the murder but has denied any personal role in the brutal killing — one that sent shock waves across the world after a U.N. investigation found that the Washington Post columnist had been a victim of a “deliberate, premeditated execution” at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The CIA also determined months after Khashoggi’s death that the prince had ordered the assassination.

As a candidate in 2019, President Biden vowed on the campaign trail to make Mohammed a “pariah” and pledged that accountability for the torture and dismemberment of the journalist would follow. Three years later, a meeting between the two leaders in Saudi Arabia — and the fist-bump with which Biden and Mohammed greeted each other — was widely condemned online.

Ahead of Biden’s trip in July to the Middle Eastern kingdom, Cengiz wrote an op-ed published by The Post imploring the president to “uphold your promise to pursue justice for Jamal.”",Q4

“We jump scare them,” said Castellanos gleefully, adding that most people got a good laugh out of it.

Bynum made snarling sounds while contorting his face to scare festival-goers, but he also like taking a more subtle approach. “Sometimes I just stare at them,” he said.

https://www.thetrucker.com/trucking-news/the-nation/accused-serial-killer-held-job-as-truck-driver-family-member-says,"Accused serial killer held job as truck driver, family member says","STOCKTON, Calif. — A man suspected of killing six men and wounding a woman in a series of shootings in Northern California has a criminal history that includes traffic violations and convictions for drug crimes, authorities said Monday.

Stockton police arrested Wesley Brownlee, 43, on Saturday after surveilling him as he drove through the streets of the city, armed with a handgun and possibly “out hunting” for another victim, police said.

A family member who asked to remain anonymous said that Brownlee worked full time as a truck driver, KXTV reported.

The family member said he was a “goodhearted person” and that police “have the wrong person.” They said Brownlee has been a responsible caregiver for ill relatives as well.

In January 1999, Brownlee had been sentenced to two years in prison in Alameda County, which encompasses the city of Oakland, for possessing and selling a controlled substance, the California corrections department said. He was released on parole in August 1999 after serving seven months.

Brownlee was again convicted in Alameda County in December 2001 and sentenced to three years for the same crime. He was released to parole in May 2003 and discharged from parole three years later.

Prosecutors in San Joaquin County, which includes Stockton, were working Monday with the city’s police department to review the evidence and expect to file charges Tuesday, said Elisa Bubak, a spokesperson for the prosecutor’s office.

It was not immediately known if Brownlee has an attorney who can comment on his behalf.

Court documents show he was first arrested at age 15 in Alameda County on suspicion of selling crack cocaine and was placed on house arrest, The East Bay Times reported.

In 1997, at age 18, Brownlee was arrested again and charged with possessing crack cocaine and was sentenced to a three-year probation term. His probation was revoked a year later after he sold cocaine to an undercover police officer, and in 1999 he was sentenced to two years in state prison and sent to San Quentin, the newspaper reported.

Brownlee grew up in Oakland just six blocks from where the Oakland victim was killed, the East Bay Times reported, citing court records. All of the Stockton killings happened near addresses listed for Brownlee and his relatives, KXTV-TV reported.

Investigators have said ballistics tests and video evidence linked the crimes. A police photo showed the black and gray weapon allegedly carried by the suspect. It appeared to be a semi-automatic handgun containing some nonmetallic materials.

Police said after Brownlee’s arrest that he was dressed in black, had a mask around his neck and a handgun, and was possibly searching for another victim when he was arrested driving around Stockton, where five men were ambushed and shot to death between July 8 and Sept. 27. Four of the victims were walking, and one was in a parked car.

Police believe the same shooter was responsible for the April 2021 killing in Oakland, some 70 miles (110 kilometers) away, and for wounding the woman in Stockton a week later.

At Saturday’s news conference, a moment of silence was held for the victims.

Juan Vasquez Serrano, 39, was killed in Oakland on April 10, 2021, and Natasha LaTour, 46, was shot in Stockton on April 16 that year but survived. The five men killed in Stockton this year were Paul Yaw, 35, who died July 8; Salvador Debudey Jr., 43, who died Aug. 11; Jonathan Hernandez Rodriguez, 21, who died Aug. 30; Juan Cruz, 52, who died Sept. 21; and Lawrence Lopez Sr., 54, who died Sept. 27.

After receiving hundreds of tips, investigators located and watched the place where Brownlee was living. They observed his patterns, determined he was out searching for another victim and arrested him, authorities said.

Police said some victims were homeless, but not all. None were beaten or robbed, and the woman who survived said her attacker didn’t say anything.

https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/f-35-sale-uae-advances-us-security-interests,F-35 Sale to UAE Advances U.S. Security Interests,"The U.S. State Department notified Congress on November 10, 2020, that it had approved the sale of a $23.4 billion defense package of F-35A Joint Strike Fighters, armed drones, munitions, and associated equipment to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Congress has 30 days from the date of notification to review the proposed sales and take action to block them under the terms of the Arms Export Control Act.

As it reviews the transaction, Congress should bear in mind that the UAE, which signed a peace agreement with Israel in September, is a long-standing U.S. ally that faces a growing threat from Iran. The defense sales would boost UAE defense capabilities, enhance the interoperability of UAE and U.S. armed forces, and help maintain a favorable balance of power in the oil-rich Arabian Gulf region as the U.S. draws down its forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Boosting Little Sparta

The UAE is a key security partner for the United States in regional counterterrorism, counterproliferation, and counter-piracy operations—and most importantly, in countering Iran. To address these threats, it is critical that the UAE develops modernized ground, air, and naval forces. The UAE signed a defense pact with the United States in 1994, permitting the Pentagon to base troops and equipment within its borders. Today, roughly 3,500 American military personnel are stationed or deployed to facilities inside the UAE.

Dubbed “Little Sparta,” the UAE has punched beyond its weight class in recent years. It has cooperated closely with the United States in strategic planning, joint exercises, logistical support, and combat operations. The cornerstone of strong bilateral security relations has been defense sales, which have enhanced the effectiveness of Emirati military forces and enabled them to work closely with U.S. and allied forces. Successive U.S. administrations have sold increasingly sophisticated weapons to the UAE since the 1980s, including F-16 fighter jets, Patriot air defense missile systems, and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system.

The Proposed Sale

Following the September 15 signing of the historic Abraham Accords between Israel and the UAE, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced U.S. approval of defense sales to the UAE worth $23.37 billion for up to 50 F-35 Lightning II aircraft, valued at $10.4 billion; up to 18 MQ-9B Reaper Unmanned Aerial Systems, valued at $2.97 billion; and a package of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions, valued at $10 billion. Pompeo noted that the sales will augment the UAE’s capacity to provide for its own self-defense and reinforce the U.S. military posture in the region to deter Iran.

The F-35 Lightning II is the world’s most dominant multi-role stealth fighter.REF The proposed sale would strengthen the UAE’s defense capabilities and deterrence of Iran. Iran has built up its ballistic missile arsenal, drone fleet, and cruise missile capabilities while deploying advanced surface-to-air missile systems, including the Russian S-300 air defense system. Iran’s military buildup may accelerate even further after the U.N. arms embargo lapsed in October. In the event of a crisis, American F-35s could be deployed to the UAE and benefit from access to the UAE’s support infrastructure. Interoperability with UAE F-35s would be a force multiplier that would enhance future U.S. military capabilities in the Gulf region, not just the UAE.

Congressional Concerns

The proposed sale sparked limited opposition in the House and Senate. Congressional critics have cited several reasons for opposing the sales, including concerns about Israel’s security, the security of the advanced technologies to be sold, alleged UAE human rights abuses against the Houthi rebels in Yemen, and worries about triggering a regional arms race. Many of these concerns are overblown and can be mitigated or offset by attaching conditions to the package or addressing the concerns through other policies. To wit:

The UAE defense package will not blunt Israel’s qualitative military edge. Most congressional critics of the sale have focused on the need to preserve Israel’s qualitative military edge, defined in a 2008 law as the ability to counter and defeat any credible conventional military threat from any individual state, possible coalition of states, or from nonstate actors, while sustaining minimal damages and casualties, through the use of superior military means. Israel is a regional superpower that already has purchased 50 F-35 aircraft, taken delivery of about half of them, and deployed them in combat operations. Israel’s F-35Is, like the F-16Is before them, are modified in country to enhance their electronic combat capabilities—modifications that give them a significant advantage over those that the U.S. will sell to any other nation, including the UAE. Moreover, the Trump Administration would not be going forward with the sale if it had not cleared it with Israeli leaders at the highest level. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Benny Gantz issued a joint statement on October 23, stating, “Since the U.S. is upgrading Israel’s military capability and is maintaining Israel’s qualitative military edge, Israel will not oppose the sale of these systems to the UAE.”REF

The sale of these systems will not jeopardize defense secrets. The Administration also appears to be well-positioned to reassure Congress about the security of the advanced technology transferred to the UAE. The Emiratis already have received and protected advanced U.S. military technology such as the F-16E/F, the most advanced operational F-16 in the world. The UAE can be counted on to protect F-35 and Reaper drone technology to maintain their technological advantages and safeguard their own security.

The deal would have no impact on human rights. Some critics of the deal have focused on allegations of human rights violations and excessive civilian casualties sustained by Yemenis in the course of the UAE’s participation in the Saudi-led coalition that intervened in 2015 on behalf of the Yemeni government. But they neglect the fact that the UAE decided in July 2019 to withdraw most of its armed forces from Yemen, leaving only a small residual force to assist Yemenis in fighting al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the Islamic State to prevent the emergence of a terrorist sanctuary. UAE special forces in Yemen also work closely with those of the United States in fighting those terrorist groups. Critics have ignored much more severe human rights violations inflicted on Yemenis by al-Qaeda, the Islamic State, and the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who have detained, tortured, and murdered innocent Yemenis to the point where the Trump Administration currently is considering whether to designate the Houthis as a terrorist organization. The Houthis also have launched ballistic missiles and drone attacks at civilian targets in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. It is difficult to imagine how denying arms to the UAE would advance the human rights of Yemenis, particularly those that the UAE is helping to protect.

The deal would not start a new arms race, but would help boost the UAE in the ongoing arms race with Iran. Critics should focus their arms race concerns on the U.N. Security Council, which allowed the U.N. arms embargo on Iran to lapse in October. Iran, which has been the prime driver of regional instability, now is free to import advanced arms from China, North Korea, and Russia. Those who are worried about halting the momentum of the ongoing arms race should actively support maintaining the strongest possible sanctions on Iran, the chief catalyst of that arms race.

Recommendations

It is highly unlikely that Congress will be able to block the UAE defense package. President Donald Trump is certain to veto any move to halt the sales, and a two-thirds majority in both houses would be required to override a presidential veto. As Congress weighs action on the sales, here are actions that can be taken.

The Executive Branch. The Administration should not expect Congress to accept the deal at face value. It should proactively engage Congress on the strength of the U.S.–UAE alliance and what both the arms deal and the Abraham Accords will bring to the region.

The House and Senate Armed Services Committees should brief their respective chambers on the security of classified weapons systems and the force-multiplying impact this deal would have to further the security of the region, as well as the strength of the U.S. military-industrial complex. The Department of Defense. The Defense Department should begin assessing the impact of adding another nation to the F-35 and MQ-9 operations and training pipelines that are conducted in the United States and begin planning to expand them accordingly.

Conclusion

Congress would be making a huge mistake if it denies the UAE a means of defending itself and deterring Iran. Such an irresponsible action risks damaging Washington’s reputation as a dependable ally, sabotaging the UAE–Israel peace agreement, and prompting the UAE and possibly other Arab allies to hedge their bets by seeking similar weapons from China and Russia. At a time when Washington is seeking to reduce its military footprint in the region to pivot to the Indo–Pacific theater and to focus on great-power military threats, the United States needs to strengthen allies to avoid creating a power vacuum that China, Iran, ISIS, Russia, or other hostile forces could fill.

In addition to making good strategic sense, the UAE defense package would have important economic benefits. The sales would strengthen the U.S. defense industrial base, help defray the overall costs of the weapons to the U.S. military, and support highly skilled jobs for American workers. The proposed sale would yield considerable strategic, foreign policy, and economic benefits for the United States.

Heche passed away on August 11, 2022, and left behind two children, Laffoon and Atlas Tupper. Her passing sparked a legal battle when Tupper, on October 3, filed documents petitioning for Laffoon to be removed as temporary executor of Heche’s estate.

Tupper had requested that an independent administrator be appointed instead. Tupper, who is Atlas’ father, had also fought with Laffoon over legal guardianship of Heche’s youngest son.

After months of a fierce legal battle, the court ruled in favor of Laffoon. His position as general administrator is likely to be permanent as he can only be removed if any evidence surfaces of fraud or embezzlement.

However, contrary to Tupper’s previous claims, the judge found no evidence of wrongdoing on Laffoon’s part. As a result, he can now proceed with the administration of Heche’s estate.

Laffoon’s lawyer stated, “We believe the court reached the correct result this morning, both legally and equitably, and are glad to have this phase of the process behind us.”

Why did James Tupper object to Homer Laffoon’s control of the estate?

When Tupper first filed his objection to Laffoon being the executor of Heche’s estate, he explained his reasoning with a legal claim. Tupper claimed that he was trying to preserve the harmony and bond between Laffoon and Atlas.

He stated that the estate was too complex for Laffoon to run and would likely cause issues that a “private professional fiduciary” would be better equipped to handle. He also produced an email from 2011 in which Heche seemingly named him as executor of her state.

However, Laffoon quickly clapped back and petitioned for Tupper to have no claim to the estate. Tupper was not in a relationship with Heche at the time of her passing, and the email was deemed invalid.

Meanwhile, the fight for the estate was also entwined with Tupper’s and Laffoon’s fight for legal guardianship of Atlas. In both his fight for the estate and guardianship, Tupper claimed that Laffoon had been hostile in his treatment of Atlas.

Furthermore, he stated that Homer had a “conflict of interest” in the guardianship battle because it related to Heche’s estate. The court eventually granted Laffoon the position of guardian ad litem.

If the need to appoint a different guardian for Atlas had arisen, it likely would’ve been a neutral party. If Tupper had been granted the position, it would’ve given him some control over Heche’s estate due to Atlas’s inheritance.

What happened to Anne Heche?

The legal battle for Heche’s estate reached its conclusion more than three months after her passing. The actress was best known for her roles in Psycho, Six Days, Seven Nights, and Donnie Brasco.

Throughout her career, she garnered several accolades, including a Primetime Emmy Award. She also gained attention for her personal life, including her high-profile relationship with Ellen DeGeneres.

On August 5, 2022, she was involved in a serious car accident that left her critically injured after she crashed her Mini Cooper into a home in Los Angeles, California.

The accident started a fire that took 60 firefighters to put out and resulted in Heche being trapped in the car for nearly an hour. She was rushed to the hospital and remained on life support for several days.

She ultimately passed away from her injuries on August 11. At the time of the accident, an investigation was started into allegations that she had been under the influence when the crash occurred.

However, the investigation was dropped after her passing. One of the residents of the home she crashed into filed a lawsuit against her estate, with the result of that lawsuit still pending.",Q4

Gregg County authorities were busy doing their job this weekend - protecting and serving East Texas communities. While out on patrol law enforcement was able to stop and identify several people who didn't realize that had a little too much to drink and instead of calling a friend or ride-sharing service, they got behind the wheel and drove or attempted to drive home. These people, in most cases, were field tested and then arrested for driving while intoxicated.

Looking through the booking report from last weekend, one of the most bizarre charges on the list is - BW/TAMP/FAB PHYS EVID W/INTENT TO IMPAIR HUM CORPSE - tampering with or fabricating physical evidence with intent to impair a human corpse. After looking at this suspect's record, this wasn't the first time he was charged with a crime of this nature.

While driving while intoxicated remains high on the list of reasons why these people were arrested in Gregg County this past weekend, others were arrested for:

assault with a deadly weapon

burglary

failure to identify - giving false information

possession of a controlled substance

no driver's license

racing on public roadway

homicide

unlawful possession of a weapon

Last weekend, arrests were conducted by the Longview and Kilgore Police Departments, Gregg County Sheriff's Office, Texas Department of Public Safety, and Marion County Sheriff's Office. Many suspects have posted bonds and are out of jail, while others await a court date. The following individuals are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.

https://news.yahoo.com/flavored-tobacco-sales-now-banned-224609084.html,Flavored tobacco sales are now banned in California. The law targets these products,"The sale of flavored tobacco is banned throughout California starting Wednesday, an effort to close what research shows is a popular gateway to tobacco addiction for young people.

The beginning of the statewide ban marks the end of a long and costly fight waged by the tobacco industry. After Gov. Gavin Newsom signed SB 793 in 2020, manufacturers spent millions trying to repeal it by placing Proposition 31 on the 2022 ballot. When voters upheld the ban by an overwhelming margin the industry sued, taking the matter all the way to the Supreme Court, which declined its petition.

California joins Massachusetts as the second state to impose a complete ban on flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes. Rhode Island, New York and New Jersey prohibit the sale of flavored vaping products.

What products are banned?

Stores and vending machines in California are not allowed to sell the following flavored tobacco items:

Menthol cigarettes

Chewing tobacco

Snuff

Cigars

E-cigarettes

Roll-your-own tobacco

These include flavors such as menthol, mint, wintergreen, fruit, chocolate, vanilla, honey, candy, cocoa, dessert, alcoholic drink, herb or spice. Anything other than tobacco is considered flavored.

One caveat is that flavored hookah and shisha, flavored pipe tobacco and flavored premium cigars, are still allowed to be sold under exceptions provided in the Stop Tobacco Access to Kids Enforcement (STAKE) Act.

When will the flavored tobacco ban begin?

Flavored tobacco items will be barred from sale starting Dec. 21.

Can stores be fined?

Yes. Stores can incur $250 fines for each violation. It will be enforced by local police and community members can also report stores.

https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/10/21/soros-backed-maricopa-county-da-candidate-supports-releasing-violent-criminals/,Soros-Backed Maricopa DA Candidate Supports Freeing Violent Criminals,"Soros-backed candidate for Maricopa County District Attorney Julie Gunnigle has repeatedly advocated for releasing violent criminals.

“I have zero patience for those who espouse criminal justice reform but only talk about our low-level non-violent offenders,” Soros-backed candidate Julie Gunnigle remarked in just one of several statements in support of violent criminals.

Gunnigle, who has praised organizations that advocate for the total abolition of prisons, has also said that sometimes violent criminals are the least likely to offend after they’ve been let out of prison. In an interview that has since been made private, Gunngile said, “Who actually is least likely to reoffend? Well, it turns out it’s just those who have been held the longest —and sometimes it’s those who have had a violent felony in their past.”

In a different interview, the Soros-backed candidate was asked whether or not she distinguishes between violent and nonviolent criminals. Gunnigle responded, “I do, but I try to use that term carefully,” before going on to claim, “Those end up being coded terms for race and making people feel otherized.”

“In Arizona it’s been a big problem because, the way our criminal code is situated, our definition of ‘violent crime’ includes offenses that really have nothing to do with the dictionary definition of violence,” the district attorney candidate added.

Gunnigle also said that prosecutors should rethink incarceration as a first response to criminal offenses, even when such offenses are violent.

What people want is safety. They want to be made whole, and a conviction doesn’t necessarily get you there, whether or not it’s for a so-called violent versus non-violent offense. I think the way to get there is to start conceptualizing it in ways that restore the community rather than just thinking about it in a way that calls for incarceration as a first response.

The Democratic candidate has also repeatedly implied that gun violence offenders should not be incarcerated. “We need to treat addiction, mental health, and gun violence as the public health crisis that they are and not an excuse to incarcerate people,” Gunnigle stated.

She has made nearly identical statements implying that gun violence offenders should not be imprisoned on multiple different occasions.

Gunnigle has even voiced her opposition to felony murder doctrine, which she has called “arbitrary.” The Soros-backed candidate stated, “I am here to reform the way we use felony murder, and I think it is rarely appropriate to be used”

“It has become problematic, however, how it’s been used … And, to me, that just highlights how arbitrary the felony murder doctrine has become and how removed it’s become from crimes that really influence the safety and health of ourcommunity,” Gunngile added.

In the same interview, Gunnigle stated that “Life in prison without the possibility of parole should be reserved for those who intend to kill or intend to cause serious bodily injury.”

The Soros-backed candidate claimed, “Felony murder in my view has been expanded far beyond what it was ever intended to do,” then going on to say, “It seems to me that this is a doctrine that’s outlived its usefulness.”

During the interview, Gunnigle was asked “Let’s take a more narrow case of two hypothetical people going in to commit a robbery and one of them kills. Does that lead to life without parole or the death penalty for the other —the other person committing the crime?” Gunnigle responded “In my view, no.”

Additionally, Gunnigle has stated that a “diversion program” should be made available “to hopefully everyone who commits a drug-motivated offense.” The candidate wasn’t just referring to drug usage however, but preceded the statement by saying, “when we look at our thefts, we look at our burglaries, we know that the root of so much of those crimes are addiction-related.”

Breitbart News revealed that Gunnigle has praised multiple organizations that have advocated for prisons to be abolished altogether. An organization called “Mass Liberation AZ” brings a “valued voice” to the criminal justice conversation, according to Gunnigle. The group states on their website “We believe all prisons, detention centers and jails should be abolished.”

Breitbart News previously revealed that Soros-backed Gunnigle wants to halt the deportation of criminal illegal aliens. The candidate has stated that prosecutors should take criminals’ immigrant status into account before arguing for sentences.

Breitbart News also revealed that the Soros-backed Democratic candidate has received endorsements from several organizations that advocate for amnesty and open borders that are themselves also backed by globalist billionaire George Soros. She also supports deadly sanctuary city policies.

Billionaire George Soros has dumped millions of dollars into organizations dedicated to advocating for mass immigration, sanctuary city policies, and amnesty through his Open Society Foundations.

Gunnigle is running against Rachel Mitchell, the Republican candidate for the position of Maricopa County District Attorney. Mitchell is currently the interim district attorney. In a debate between the two, Mitchell called out Gunnigle for calling to remove $25 million from the Phoenix Police.

A rep for the streaming service told TMZ Monday that the company is not removing the doc because West was not a creator or promoter on the project, but rather the subject.

The rep noted that Netflix doesn't have a history of removing content of producers or performers who later find themselves mired in controversy.

The latest: The Kanye West documentary Jeen-Yuhs will remain streaming on Netflix amid the rapper's ongoing anti-Semitism controversy. West, 45, was seen in an interview with Piers Morgan last week

Jeen-Yuhs, which debuted on the streaming service in February, is described by the streamer as an 'intense, intimate docuseries charting Kanye West's career, filmed over two decades.'

The statement from the streamer comes following a story from The New York Times examining West's business relationships after he publicly spoke out against Jewish people.

The paper reported that West's future in music is unclear, as he had not been affiliated with the Def Jam Recordings since the release of Donda in August of 2021.

His February album, Donda 2, was released exclusively on his stem player. Def Jam is also not distributing material from West's label Kanye's Getting Out Our Dreams, according to the report, though it is unclear when the severance took place.

Fashion mainstays including Vogue magazine and Balenciaga have publicly distanced themselves from the rapper/fashion designer.

A rep for Balenciaga's parent company Kering told Women’s Wear Daily Friday, the company 'has no longer any relationship nor any plans for future projects related to this artist.'

A spokesperson for Vogue told Page Six Friday that the magazine and its editor-in-chief Anna Wintour have no plans on working with West in the future.

An insider said Wintour 'has had enough' of West's behavior, and 'has made it very clear inside Vogue that Kanye is no longer part of the inner circle.'

West on Monday was dropped by the talent agency CAA, which he initially signed with six years ago.

Another documentary about West made by the studio MRC will be shelved in the wake of the scandal, the AP reported, as execs Modi Wiczyk, Asif Satchu and Scott Tenley said in a Monday memo, 'We cannot support any content that amplifies his platform.'

They added: 'Kanye is a producer and sampler of music. Last week he sampled and remixed a classic tune that has charted for over 3000 years - the lie that Jews are evil and conspire to control the world for their own gain.

'This song was performed acapella in the time of the Pharaohs, Babylon and Rome, went acoustic with The Spanish Inquisition and Russia’s Pale of Settlement, and Hitler took the song electric. Kanye has now helped mainstream it in the modern era.'

West's latest racism controversy began with an October 3 Paris Fashion Week showcase for his Yeezy line that saw him and conservative commentator Candace Owens don tops that read White Lives Matter on the back

West made the offensive remarks on October 8 after he faced restrictions on Instagram

West's turbulent month of race-related controversies kicked off October 3 when he and and conservative commentator Candace Owens donned tops that read White Lives Matter during a Paris Fashion Week showcase for his Yeezy line.

West faced restrictions on his social media sites after he tweeted October 8: 'I'm a bit sleepy tonight but when I wake up I'm going death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE ... The funny thing is I actually can't be Anti Semitic because black people are actually Jew also ... you guys have toyed with me and tried to black ball anyone whoever opposes your agenda.'

West was asked by Piers Morgan Wednesday if he regretted the tweet and he said, 'No - absolutely not, absolutely not ... I fought fire with fire - I’m not here to get hosed down - that’s a different type of freedom fighter.'

He later clarified: 'I will say I'm sorry for the people that I hurt,' he said. 'I feel like I cause hurt and confusion, and I'm sorry for the families of the people that had nothing to do with the trauma that I had been through and that I use my platform where you say, ""Hurt people hurt people,"" and I was hurt.'

West's name made further headlines over the weekend after a group took to the 405 Freeway in Los Angeles saluting Adolf Hitler with banners that read, 'Kanye is right about the Jews' and 'Honk if you know.'",Q4

HARRIS COUNTY, Texas — A stepfather was shot and killed late Sunday night after he got into a fight with two men who were with his teenage stepdaughters, according to the Harris County Sheriff's Office.

It happened in the middle of a neighborhood on Spectacled Bear in Crosby just after 11 p.m.

Deputies believe the stepfather didn't approve of the men his stepdaughters were dating and had ongoing issues with them. As the stepdaughters got home with the men, the stepfather went outside to confront them, which led to a physical fight and the shooting.

When emergency crews arrived, they found the man laying in the street with at least one gunshot wound. He was transported to the hospital and pronounced dead.

When Jody Steinauer was growing up in the ’80s in Nebraska, Roe v. Wade had been decided less than a decade earlier. The important women in Steinauer’s family, especially her mother, made sure to express to her that reproductive care was essential to the life of a woman and that abortion was a universal right.

As Steinauer’s career progressed and she became a senior ob/gyn at the University of California, San Francisco, the need for abortion access only became more salient. “Abortion provision and training was just core to what I love and care about as an ob/gyn,” Steinauer told me. As a student, she was one of the founders of Medical Students for Choice, a student-led organization that continues to work to destigmatize abortion training, as well as convince affiliated schools to include “abortion as a part of a comprehensive reproductive health services curriculum.”

“One of our core tenets at the very beginning was that every physician needs to graduate with knowledge about abortion and be able to competently provide compassionate, nondirected pregnancy options, counseling, and referral, no matter what,” Steinauer said. She also emphasized the need for physicians to “work out their own feelings about abortion.”

But anti-abortion groups and Roe detractors were hard at work stacking courts and shoehorning unconstitutional laws so that in 2022, the nearly 50-year effort to overturn Roe and return abortion from a constitutionally protected right to a felony charge reached its peak. The Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision has allowed abortion to become effectively illegal in half the country. An entire medical field has been thrown into disarray, leaving many practitioners unemployed, morally compromised, and unduly burdened. People with uteruses have to contend with a future without a right that for nearly half a century has been protected in America.

Doctors have historically been cohesive in their ethics and standards, but the Dobbs decision challenges that on the national level. The fight against restrictive abortion bans has to ask whether more providers will join Steinauer in the recognition that these bans will not only have long-lasting effects on women’s care, but will impair all health care, as well as compromise the duty of doctors to their patients and their ethics.

IN 1993, DR. DAVID GUNN, AN ABORTION PROVIDER, was murdered outside of the clinic where he worked in Pensacola, Florida. That same year, thousands of medical students, including Steinauer, began receiving “vulgar and menacing” anti-abortion pamphlets through the mail. Long before the Dobbs decision, reproductive rights had been under assault, in ways that were both crude and insidious. A 1991 study detailing how only 12 percent of ob/gyns received training in routine abortion care illustrated the gap in education.

The Kenneth J. Ryan Program, which Steinauer now leads from her post at the UCSF Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health, was created in response to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) mandate requiring abortion training as part of obstetrics and gynecology residencies. The program is partially responsible for the more than 60 percent of providers who now receiving specialized abortion training, when it was able to operate in a world where Roe was considered settled.

Doctors have historically been cohesive in their ethics and standards, but the Dobbs decision challenges that on the national level.

But after the Dobbs decision, at least a dozen Ryan Program iterations that function in states that are restricting or banning abortion face an uncertain future. This means that in states like Louisiana, where abortion is banned in nearly all cases, ob/gyns are forced to either travel out of state or never comprehensively complete their residencies.

In addition, the decision has opened up the risk of a further loss of practitioners in restrictive states. One month after the Dobbs decision, there were 43 fewer clinics offering abortions across 11 states that had severely restricted or banned the practice, according to a Guttmacher Institute analysis. The remaining clinics all operate within states that have six-week bans instead of total bans.

NICOLA MOORE, FAMILY DOCTOR, HAS BEEN an abortion provider for over a decade, and was working with Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas when the Supreme Court issued Dobbs. Moore had been acquainted with severe restrictions in Texas before the decision, due to the Texas Heartbeat Bill (HB 1500) that was passed in late 2021. Under this law, Moore would perform ultrasounds and determine whether there was a heartbeat, making her the last person many would see before they were denied an abortion.

Moore would do her best to inform patients that, while the law prevented her from performing an abortion if she detected a heartbeat, other states, like New Mexico, could be a refuge—but it was hardly a comfort.

“The work was very different after the heartbeat bill because there was a lot more dealing with very emotional things with patients,” Moore told me. She described the demeanor of her patients after the bill as “stressed and frantic.”

Moore also had her own future to worry about. The Dobbs decision would have left her unemployed if not for the fact that she traveled for work regularly, having worked in six other states over her career. Still, the ruling threw her life into disarray. Not only did Moore have to deal with worrying about her next source of income; there was also the emotion of leaving a crew at Planned Parenthood Texas that she had come to dearly cherish.

After Dobbs took away her Texas job, Moore secured her Florida license. She plans to work in Tallahassee, an area she chose out of a desire to be “useful,” and because Tallahassee is closest to the abortion desert in the South. Abortions are banned after 15 weeks in Florida, the least restrictive among the Deep South. In Tallahassee, Moore will be at the intersection of Florida and Georgia, where they have already seen large increases in patients, especially travelers. One NPR affiliate quoted a doctor estimating a 30 to 40 percent increase at a clinic in Tallahassee a month after the Dobbs ruling. As Politico reported, nearly 5,000 women traveled to Florida to get an abortion in 2021.

Moore’s history of traveling put her in a slightly less precarious situation, she told me. Other providers who, perhaps, have families or roots in a restrictive state may not find it so easy to leave.

× Expand AARON M. SPRECHER/AP PHOTO The up-front cost to a patient for an abortion in a state where it remains legal can be burdensome.

Now that Roe has been overturned, the option to travel is more stressful than it may seem. Less restrictive states have seen an increase in patients, as well as wait times, placing a strain on systems and practitioners who have kept their jobs. A month after the decision, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that one clinic in Skokie, Illinois, had seen a 130 percent increase over 2021 of in-person visits. The New York Times reported in July that five out of eight New Mexico abortion clinics had wait times longer than three weeks for an abortion, mostly due to interstate travel.

“The capacity at clinics across the country is stretched,” said Elizabeth Nash, the principal policy associate for state issues with the Guttmacher Institute. In addition, “the train is on the track” for more closures and deeper contraction of providers, she told me.

In some states, the laws are changing so rapidly that providers are unsure of what might happen week to week. Michigan, for example, has been in a legal back-and-forth over an 1846 law last updated in 1931 that makes providing an abortion a felony. The law was struck down in September by the Michigan Court of Claims; in Judge Elizabeth Gleicher’s decision, she asserted that the law “denies women of their ability to control their bodies and their lives.” There will be a referendum on the November ballot to make abortion rights constitutionally protected.

And in states where the law criminalizes performing an abortion, Nash said, “there are very limited exceptions to these abortion bans and there are steep penalties for violating the law. Providers are going to be very risk-averse.”

Abortion bans force doctors to sacrifice legal security or battle internally with the moral question of helping someone over their own livelihood.

Providers worry about their liability when it comes to performing even a procedure they understand to be legal. In states like Oklahoma, doctors can be sued for up to $10,000 for performing an abortion. In most cases, it carries a felony charge. “In Missouri, every abortion must be reported to the state, and prosecutors can request a court order to examine records and confirm a medical emergency was present,” Stat News reported. A prosecutor who wants to make a case against a provider—or simply wreak havoc—has an avenue to do so.

Gretchen Borchelt, litigator with the National Women’s Law Center, constantly fields legal questions from doctors after the Dobbs decision. Doctors wonder if instances that need emergency abortion or miscarriage management are unlawful; Borchelt has even had social workers worried about their liability were they to suggest an abortion.

“There’s not a situation like this where it’s just outlawed, and providers are having to worry about criminal liability for providing care that 1 in 4 women will need in their lifetime,” Borchelt said.

Practitioners also have to worry about who would protect them were they to find themselves needing defense against a restrictive abortion law. This is new territory for lawyers, as well, Borchelt told me. And while insurance covers medical malpractice, a felony charge is rarely insured, and carries with it a loss of licensure in many places. Kate Dielentheis described to me a situation where the thought of being sued by a patient for medical malpractice is the lesser of two evils, between that and being sued by the state for a felony charge. The result of this grotesque cost-benefit analysis can be a patient not getting timely, necessary care.

Dielentheis works in Wisconsin providing obstetrics and gynecology care. An 1849 law banning abortion took effect after the Dobbs decision. As a generalist and ob/gyn, Dielentheis is prohibited from doing “a big chunk” of her job. She expressed frustration about how this old law can disrupt such an important part of her and other women’s lives.

“This is a law that came before ultrasounds, before the modern-day pregnancy test. This was a law that came so far before the vast majority of our medical knowledge,” she said. “It’s really hard to take that law and extrapolate it to how we practice medicine because a lot of this wouldn’t have been recognized in 1849.”

Dielentheis also trains residents, but she is no longer able to provide abortion training in the state of Wisconsin. She and other doctors are working on a way to create connections with other programs so that they can provide the full scope of training to the many residents who feel this training is essential.

“From a health care perspective, it’s incredibly important that they have that training in order to be able to take care of patients in the future,” Dielentheis said.

Doctors swear the Hippocratic oath, declaring that they will do no harm and work only to aid people medically. Abortion bans are in direct conflict with this oath, leaving doctors in a position where they must sacrifice legal security or battle internally with the moral question of helping someone over their own livelihood.

The resulting emotional deliberation forces doctors into an uncomfortable position. Ultimately, many feel sad and angry to be put in this position. Sarah Prager, an ob/gyn at the University of Washington in Seattle, has seen a lot of gratitude from her patients. But it brings her no joy.

“I don’t feel like you should be grateful to have what is routine health care that, in the last 50 years, has been accessed by a third to a quarter of all people with a uterus,” she said.

STEINAUER’S FAMILY DID NOT JUST DECIDE one day that abortion was important. This family, like millions, went through the stigma around unintended pregnancies and abortions before Roe was handed down.

After Steinauer graduated from college, she learned that her mother had been pregnant before her with her half-sibling who was put up for adoption and eventually reconnected with the family. Then, she learned of two other women in her family having unintended pregnancies, as well. One had a pre-Roe abortion and the other was wed as a result.

“I had all three outcomes of an unintended pregnancy, right in my family unit,” she said. “That definitely made it clear.”

Expand JEFF CHIU/AP PHOTO Jody Steinauer was a founder of Medical Students for Choice, and today works as a senior ob/gyn at the University of California, San Francisco.

It is “extra sad” for Steinauer to think about how prior family generations might feel about the Dobbs v. Jackson ruling. The emotion that comes with having a right stripped away, after being unilaterally protected, is a tough one. Steinauer knows this professionally and personally.

When it becomes clear that their hands are legally tied, doctors are seeing patients upset, angry, and frightened. Many patients have to spring into action arranging transportation, funds, and support as they prepare to travel out of state.

If a patient is able to secure an appointment and timely transportation, the up-front cost of an abortion is additionally burdensome. Abortions can cost up to $2,000 out of pocket. According to a study published in the journal Women’s Health Issues, among patients who traveled 50 miles or more, nearly 60 percent reported difficulties related to missing work; more than 35 percent reported delays due to financial costs. This is further complicated by many states barring the use of Medicaid for nonresident patients. Then there are the costs associated with travel. Patients may have to worry about gas money, plane tickets (or car rentals), child care, and lodging.

In addition to the logistical frustration and general emotion doctors are seeing, Dielentheis noted the incredulousness she faces from patients. When she tells them that—even in the event of a nonviable pregnancy—she cannot help them, “people are surprised, and they’re frustrated, and they’re angry,” she said.

Hospitals have been facing staffing and funding shortages for years. With the Dobbs decision, Bloomberg reported that “[s]pecialists in obstetrics and gynecology—frequent targets of medical malpractice lawsuits—especially are wary of taking jobs in states where the laws could limit their practice.” There has also been a particularly devastating contraction of rural hospitals.

Now, providers are considering whether they can stay in their state and provide care that fits their conscience, or even adequate care. And the residents that end up receiving training in another state may elect to not come back. As Roll Call reported, “The choice of where to train could have a long-term effect,” as over 55 percent of doctors practiced within the same state they received the training.

“Many of [the residents] are electing not to stay in Wisconsin,” Dielentheis said. “It’s going to be harder to get people to work in certain areas, where care is really needed.”

And an important pipeline has now been removed. Catholic hospitals have never performed elective abortions. Before the Dobbs decision, however, some Catholic medical professionals were able to essentially outsource patients who needed an abortion to a clinic or hospital that would or could perform the surgery. Without Roe v. Wade to protect those institutions and the care they provide, access is further restricted and the Catholic absolute ban becomes law in dozens of states.

“We now have no backup plan for those patients in the states with abortion bans,” said Lori Freedman, a researcher on Catholic hospitals with the Bixby Center. “Catholic health care has been dependent on the providers to pick up where they are and to prevent harm.”

For Prager, maternal mortality rates rising as a result of the Dobbs ruling is about “when,” not “if.” The United States already has a disproportionately high maternal mortality rate among developed countries.

In states where abortion is permitted in the event of a medical emergency or “to save the life of a mother,” the vague distinction has left hospitals and patients reeling. Doctors are being forced to wait until a person is on the verge of death, hesitating out of fear that acting too early could be interpreted as an illegal abortion. Providers need to run a decision to help a patient up the hierarchical ladder of the institution, and administrators then consult with legal and ethics boards before passing down a decision on whether a doctor can save a life.

Providers also report that more people are coming in inquiring about permanent sterilization. Prager is used to performing maybe ten sterilization procedures a year in just her clinic; she says the number has jumped to eight to ten approvals for the procedure per month.

“These are people who are in their twenties, who have never had children and don’t ever want to chance it,” Prager said. “They now don’t feel secure in the fact that they will have options.”

“People are not realizing how this has really impacted desired pregnancies as well,” Dielentheis said.

The lack of control that people have over this personal decision is alarming. It is a gross manipulation of the medical system, placing countless barriers in the way of someone obtaining care they need. State legislatures were not prepared for the way this decision would impact the entire health care system. Drugs with dual purposes—abortifacient and non-abortifacient—such as methotrexate, are being restricted. Contraception and other forms of reproductive care are being threatened; all the while, patients with uteruses suffer.

WHILE THE FUTURE LOOKS BLEAK AND HOSTILE, reproductive rights groups are hardly backing down. Abortion could still be codified into law, through either federal or state legislation or referenda or, as Borchelt sees it, even a constitutional amendment.

And there have been surprising successes, such as Kansas’s landslide vote against a restrictive anti-abortion law. Meanwhile, doctors and patients alike are rising up to protest for their autonomy. There have been numerous national protests in the aftermath, from Washington, D.C., to New York, Chicago, and San Francisco.

The popular backlash against the Dobbs decision, and the impractical, cruel ways that several states are carrying it out, has energized progressives and surprised the anti-abortion lobby. What remains to be seen is whether more doctors will join this struggle, in the spirit of medical leaders like Jody Steinauer.

The medical profession is notoriously risk-averse and heavily commercialized. With the exception of the activist doctors who battle for abortion rights and single-payer health insurance, physicians tend to shun controversy. But now controversy that doctors didn’t seek has come to them—and their professional autonomy and duty to their patients are at risk. Whether reproductive rights and women’s health as a right will be defended could very well depend on whether the medical profession as a whole leaves its comfort zone.",Q4

Because Now You Can Access Academic-Level Classes without a Degree—and with a Twist of Lime

Like the enduring green light at the end of Daisy Buchanan’s dock in The Great Gatsby, a colorful neon sign on a Mangum Street storefront has been drawing in passersby. But if that fictional light symbolized the allure of wealth and excess, Durham’s Night School Bar’s signage represents something very different: equity in education and the chance to learn about all the, er, poisonous pitfalls of the American dream.

Founded by Arcana’s Lindsey Andrews and opened this past fall, Night School Bar is a collective of instructors “offering evening classes in the arts and humanities to curious adults” on a sliding scale. Initially started during the pandemic as an online school, the school’s brick-and-mortar at 719 Mangum is now a friendly neighborhood bar with space for classes (a selection from this winter’s offerings: Writing for the Revolution, Black Feminist Paths to Freedom, and Mutual Aid as Social Transformation). This access to thoughtful pedagogy—alongside thoughtful cocktails, should you just want to drop by for a Night School nightcap—feels like the very best that the Triangle has to offer.

Because Hopscotch Is Back, and So Are the Small Clubs

Festivals haven’t had it easy the past few years, and Hopscotch has taken some hits. But this year—the three-day festival’s 13th—Hopscotch was back in full swing with a slate of ticketed small-club shows, “programming eight indoor rooms a night to compliment its two outdoor main stages.” Pavement (the festival’s “biggest get ever,” director Nathan Price told us) headlined, the introduction of comedy sets kept things interesting, there was a dash of rain, there was dancing amid a downtown sea of Blundstones and crop tops—and we feel more thankful than ever that Hopscotch has weathered the hard times. Next year, the festival returns September 5-7. Early bird tickets are already on sale.

Because the Rialto Is Back, Too

I screen, you screen, we all screen: in one of the most heartwarming local arcs of the year, downtown Raleigh’s 90-year-old Rialto Theater—the oldest in the city—reopened to the public. “The theater survived the pandemic, somehow, but closed in August 2022 when longtime manager Bill Peebles retired,” reporter Jasmine Gallup wrote in October. “The theater’s future was uncertain until it was bought by SportsChannel8 reporter Hayes Permar and a group of Raleigh investors earlier this year.” As streaming services slowly drain theaters of business—in Durham, two AMC theaters have closed in just the past few months—the endurance of a cozy local theater is something to celebrate. Here’s to more movies and popcorn in 2024.

This one comes with a caveat, because—as reported in depth by our partners at The Assembly—Duke’s Center for Documentary Studies has had an institutionally dubious few years, with its staff and programming shrinking dramatically and the in-person film festival put on indefinite hiatus. But as we ride the optimistic coattails of other resurrections (see: the Rialto, Nanas), we are thrilled that the beloved documentary festival will be back in action, this April 4-7, and hope that it has many years of movie magic to come. “I am proud of the documentaries Full Frame has screened online in recent years,” longtime director Sadie Tillery told the INDY, “but nothing compares to seeing a film illuminate the darkness of a crowded movie theater.” We agree.

Because Restaurants Persist and Continue to Reinvent

In Raleigh, Humble Pie has closed, but pasta restaurant Figulina will open in the space soon in a way that feels all in the family (the restaurant is helmed by David Ellis, who has worked with Ashley Christensen, who got her start at Humble Pie), just as it feels appropriate that Cheetie Kumar gets to slow down with the closure of downtown Raleigh’s Garland as she embarks on a new chapter with the sweet, scaled-down Five Points spot Ajja. And in Durham, though we were very sad to see downtown diner Jack Tar close, we are happy that the corner is staying lively with the second location of Preeti Waas’s Cheeni, which opened this fall.

(Janes/Dan Wasserbly)

Cummins Advanced Combat Engine (ACE), an opposed-piston 1,000 hp engine,is to be demonstrated at Camp Grayling, Michigan, on 27 October, during a US Army Ground Vehicle Systems Center (GVSC)-sponsored event, Dion Anglin, the company's defence market director, told Janes on 10 October at the annual Association of the United States Army (AUSA) 2022 convention in Washington, DC.

ACE is a GVSC-funded programme to create a modular, scalable diesel engine that can power a smaller combat platform similar to the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle up to the most power-intensive platform, the Abrams main battle tank, Anglin said.

The army awarded Cummins an USD87 million contract in July 2021 to complete ACE's development. That ‘other transaction authority' contract built upon a competitive multiyear GVSC effort to develop new powertrain technology. “The OTA allows for transitioning the new technology into the next generation of vehicle programmesahead of the programmes' launch dates,” Cummins said in a statement.

ACE is tied to the army's Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) programme, which is slated to become the first platform to host the common engine, Anglin told Janes. The OMFV is in a concept design phase, and ACE is therefore not expected to be in full production until the 2026–28 timeframe.

ACE's layout options enable the engine to be configured in 3-cylinder, 4-cylinder, and 6-cylinder arrangements to deliver power ranging from 750 to 1,500 hp. “ACE can be integrated into hybrid architectures enabling commonality, thereby eliminating the expensive logistical burden of having multiple combat powertrains and facilitating the incorporation of new electrified technologies,” Cummins added.",Q4

They’ve been around as long as our nation has existed–probably for as long as the gun has existed–but they do actually seem to be happening far more often in our modern day.

As such, teachers have concerns. They most definitely should.

Over at the Harvard Political Review, one writer penned a piece recently which was titled, “Teachers: Soldiers Against School Shootings.”

Being a teacher is a tough job for several reasons. Challenges such as student behavior and the technical challenges wrought by a shift to “remote” teaching, for instance, have only accelerated after the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, low pay and plummeting school funding have contributed to the loss of 40,000 aspiring teachers, a decline of nearly one-third since 2010. Nearly one-third of new teachers, including all the teachers interviewed by the HPR, have taken up several jobs along with teaching. In recent years, another challenge has arisen: the rising number of school shootings in the United States. Teachers are one of the groups who are most affected by school shootings and it is more important than ever to highlight their voices — voices which are calling for meaningful safety measures, tighter gun control, and increased investment into the education system. Teachers are calling for help against a war. Fighting a War Within a Classroom The Memorial to Fallen Educators was installed in 2013 to honor educators who have died protecting their students. The memorial honors fallen educators “who had lost their lives ‘in the line of duty,’” a line that seemingly belongs on a memorial honoring soldiers. In recent years, the rise of school shootings has called teachers to this grave responsibility: fighting a war against school shooters.

Now, I think that last sentence is more than a little hyperbolic, to say the least. However, let’s say they’re actually “fighting a war against school shooters.”

Well, if we’re to accept that premise, then they’re doing a pretty poor job of it.

No, I’m not disparaging teachers with that. It’s not their fault. They’ve been playing with a stacked deck, one that keeps them from being able to fight this war effectively.

In the Battle of Stalingrad, the Red Army reportedly sent thousands of men to the field without rifles. They were told to pick one up from the corpse of a dead comrade. Some say it’s a myth while others think it happened.

Yet even if those Red Army troops really did have an insufficient number of rifles, they’re still better armed than the teachers who are supposedly fighting the war on school shootings.

Look, gun control is a fool’s bargain at best. It’s an idea that banks on evil people being insufficiently motivated to find a way to murder the innocent. Considering the worst mass killings in American history involved airplanes or rental trucks filled with fuel and fertilizer, it’s downright silly to argue that without access to guns, schools wouldn’t be vulnerable.

If teachers are going to be “soldiers” in a war against mass shootings, then just maybe it’s time to arm them so they can fight back effectively.

Mass shootings aren’t going to just go away. We’ve seen them in other countries with far stricter gun control rules than we have, so imagining they’ll just stop if we pass one more gun control law is pure fantasy.

But we can better protect our children.

Schools need to be hardened so as to protect those kids. Teachers need to have the means to defend themselves from violent attacks if they so choose. Police departments need to understand that they can’t wait outside while kids are being brutally murdered outside.

A lot needs to happen, but gun control isn’t the answer to any of it.",Q4

Murdaugh was the leader of a prominent upcountry South Carolina family whose patriarchs had been attorneys for centuries. But his life began unraveling last year, beginning with the deaths of his wife, Maggie, and son Paul.

Alex Murdaugh, center, talks with his defense attorney Dick Harpootlian after a hearing in Colleton County on Aug. 29, 2022.

“After carefully reviewing this case and all the surrounding facts, we have decided to seek life without parole for Alex Murdaugh,” South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson said Tuesday in a statement. “Because this is a pending case, we cannot comment further.”

Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were fatally shot on June 7, 2021, at the family’s home in Hampton County. Alex was a long-running suspect in the case, but he wasn’t formally charged until July 2022.

At a hearing last month, prosecutors suggested Alex Murdaugh killed his family members to garner sympathy as a reckoning for his various other crimes was approaching.

Investigators have said Murdaugh stole millions of dollars from his law firm — and in some cases from clients — to fund his drug addiction.

As his life fell apart, Murdaugh paid Curtis Smith, allegedly his drug dealer, to kill him and stage it as a drive-by shooting in September 2021. Murdaugh’s apparent motive was to allow his living son, Buster, to receive a $10 million life insurance payout. However, the former lawyer survived the shooting.

Murdaugh surrendered to police after the botched assisted suicide and has been behind bars ever since.",Q4

PORTLAND, Ore. — As foreshadowed by several Oregon sheriffs after voters narrowly approved gun control initiative Measure 114, the new law is now subject to a lawsuit seeking to put regulations to a halt before they go into place.

On Friday, ""no compromise"" gun rights group the Oregon Firearms Federation, Sherman County Sheriff Brad Lohrey and the owner of a Marion County gun store filed a lawsuit naming Governor Kate Brown and State Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum. Their attorneys want a judge to block the measure from becoming law.

Not only do the plaintiffs argue that Measure 114 violates the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, they claim that it violates the Oregon Constitution. And if a judge doesn't agree that the measure is unconstitutional in its entirety, the plaintiffs want a pause on the high-capacity magazine ban portion.

Measure 114 bans gun magazines of more than 10 rounds and creates a new permit process to buy a gun, one that involves safety training, background checks and a fee. Due to an unexpected quirk of the process, it also becomes law one month after Election Day — just over two weeks from now.

It's impossible to tell whether a judge will agree to block Measure 114, but some kind of decision is expected before it becomes law on Dec. 8.

The lawsuit takes aim at Measure 114's ban on high-capacity magazines, characterizing magazines that hold more them 10 rounds as ""standard issue,"" and owned by millions of law-abiding Americans.

""Banning magazines over 10 rounds is no more likely to reduce criminal abuse of guns then banning high horsepower engines is likely to reduce criminal abuse of automobiles,"" the suit says. ""The only thing the ban contained in 114 ensures is that a criminal unlawfully carrying a firearm with a magazine over 10 rounds will have a potentially devastating advantage over his law-abiding victim.""

A separate challenge against California's ban on high-capacity magazines is already in the court system. A lawsuit now before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals challenges California's regulations as unconstitutional. This court also has jurisdiction over Oregon, so a decision to strike down California's law would effectively quash this part of Measure 114 in Oregon as well.

The lawsuit against Measure 114 also makes the argument that it violates part of the Oregon Constitution, though this angle has nothing to do with magazine capacity.

Article XI, Section 15 of the Oregon Constitution says, ""when the Legislative Assembly or any state agency requires any local government to establish a new program or provide an increased level of service for an existing program, the State of Oregon shall appropriate and allocate to the local government moneys sufficient to pay the ongoing, usual and reasonable costs of performing the mandated service or activity.""

The argument is that local sheriff's offices and police departments are now charged with handling the new permitting process for people to buy firearms, including the requirements for safety training. How can they do their regular jobs, the lawsuit argues, and add these new duties without any state funding to hire more people to help?

There are similarities between the Measure 114 permit process and the current process for obtaining a Concealed Handgun License (CHL) in Oregon. It's not a one-to-one comparison — as Lincoln County Sheriff Curtis Landers pointed out, CHL classes to date may not provide all of the same training required by Measure 114. But CHL classes that do meet all of the requirements would qualify as a stand-in for the necessary training to receive a permit, and sheriff's offices in Oregon are already accustomed to accepting and evaluating CHL applications.

Theoretically, however, Measure 114 will result in a much higher volume of people seeking permits for firearms than there were CHL-seekers prior to the new law.

Over the weekend, KGW spoke with Rev. Mark Knutson of Lift Every Voice Oregon, the group responsible for Measure 114. He disputed the lawsuit's claim that the measure infringes on the constitutional rights of Oregonians, especially as concerns high capacity magazines.

""Those who already have them, it already says they would keep them, could use them on their property or at shooting ranges — so nobody's taking away anybody's guns, or their magazines,"" Knutson said. ""So this is about public safety, safe schools, safe communities, and it's been proven to save lives.""

When Measure 114 was drafted, Knutson said, the interfaith coalition consulted with gun owners, hunters and law enforcement on the particulars.",Q4

Greg Abbott and Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke went head-to-head Friday night in the only sscheduled debate of the 2022 Texas gubernatorial race.

In the fast-paced and lively debate that covered immigration, guns, abortion, law enforcement, the electric grid, public education and property taxes, both candidates went on the offensive – doubling down on their respective campaigns’ primary talking points.

Here are five key takeaways from the night:

More:Beto O'Rourke needed a debate knockout against Greg Abbott. Did he land it?

O'Rourke attacks Abbott's record

O’Rourke wasted no time in going after the policies Abbott has implemented while in office, starting with border security.

O'Rourke said Operation Lone Star, Abbott's costly border security initiative, has ""clearly failed. The numbers are in, we're seeing not fewer but more engagements at our border when the governor has spent $4 billion of our tax dollars on what has turned out to be political theater for his political career. … We don't need any more stunts. We need solutions.”

O’Rourke argued that Abbott has presided over a number of failures, including several mass shootings, rising crime rates, skyrocketing property taxes, a complete rollback on abortion access, and the near collapse of the state’s electric grid.

Abbott paints O'Rourke as 'flip-flopper,' ties him to Biden

Abbott said O’Rourke was “flip-flopping” on key positions, arguing the former U.S. Senate and presidential candidate has previously supported ""open borders"" and ""defunding the police,"" both of which O’Rourke denied.

Abbott also sought to tie O’Rourke to the Biden administration, frequently mentioning the president throughout the hourlong debate.

“Beto just wants to perpetuate the open border policies and mischaracterize exactly what's going on. He refuses to acknowledge that the city of El Paso, because they were so overwhelmed by Joe Biden's open border policies, they too are having to bus migrants out of their communities because they have no way of keeping them there,” Abbott said.

With Uvalde families in the building, heated gun control discussion

With several parents of Uvalde shooting victims watching the debate from a room just outside the debate hall, the candidates sharply disagreed on how to address the problem of mass shootings.

O’Rourke slammed Abbott for failing to take action on gun violence, and dug in on measures the Uvalde families have called over the months since the May 24 school shooting, including raising the minimum age to purchase a semi-automatic rifle, adopting red flag laws and requiring universal background checks, without clarifying whether he still supports an assault weapons ban.

Abbott repeated his position that he believes raising the minimum age to purchase an assault-style rifle would be unconstitutional, saying that he opposes the idea “purely from a legal perspective.” He said he would prioritize school safety as an emergency item during the next legislative session.

O'Rourke targets moderates; Abbott defends swing to the right

When asked whether he has pivoted too far to the right, Abbott defended his positions on abortion and guns, saying he’s governing “by his principles”; he recounted the adoption of his daughter, saying that experience reaffirmed his anti-abortion stance.

O’Rourke, however, frequently mentioned how he would work with Republicans and Democrats to pass “common sense bipartisan solutions,” like expanding Medicaid, reducing property taxes, and enacting gun restrictions.

“Look, I don't think that Greg Abbott wakes up wanting to see children shot in their schools or for the grid to fail, but it's clear that he's incapable or unwilling to make the changes necessary to prioritize the lives of our fellow Texans. That's why it's on all of us to make sure that we have change at the ballot box,” O’Rourke said in his closing statement.

“I'm running for reelection to keep Texas No. 1 — to cut your property taxes, to secure the border, to keep dangerous criminals behind bars, and to keep deadly fentanyl off our streets together. We will keep Texas No. 1,” Abbott said.

Despite fast pace, no major gaffes or viral moments

With both candidates limited to 60 seconds to answer a question and only 15 or 30 seconds to respond to follow-ups or rebuttals, the debate was fast paced, with both candidates striving to land punches.

But with both candidates exhibiting passion and restraint, the night concluded without any major gaffes or viral moments. Prior to the debate, political analysts had suggested that escaping without any significant mistakes would be a win for Abbott, while scoring a heavy blow against the governor would be the primary goal for O’Rourke.",Q4

She believes that's part of what makes the long-term care facilities, established in 1976 as a ministry and sponsored by the Sisters of Charity, a great place to work and live.

“Aging in America is seen as a negative so often,” said Haynes, who’s been with Nazareth Home since 2001. “That's so interesting to me, because we are all aging all the time. And it's not so bad. You know? It's not so bad. Everybody wants to live a long time, but nobody wants to be old.""

That's why she tries to ""bust that old image,"" she said, ""and try to have a thriving image.” That thriving image comes through at Nazareth, which has two locations in Louisville and 375 employees.

The nonprofit was recognized in this year's Top Workplaces survey, finishing fourth among employers with 300 or more employees in the Louisville region.

Some of the respondents in the anonymous survey said they enjoy working there because of their coworkers and the job. One worker said, ""I know my voice is heard and valued."" Another said, ""I am surrounded by people living the mission.""

""Everyone treats just not the residents but each other with Respect,"" another respondent said.

Hanging in hallways throughout the Newburg Road location are calendars packed with events: yoga, movie night, painting, hair and nails fun, bingo, trivia, Catholic Mass, music concerts, and many more.

Art painted by elders adorns the hallways − seashells stuck to brown and blues, the ocean meeting sand. Elders enjoy happy hours regularly.

Still, COVID-19 restrictions remain. The Wednesday night supper club, complete with family and friends, a special menu, a cocktail of the week and ""blaring"" music, hasn't made a post-COVID return yet, though Haynes hopes that can happen soon.

COVID forced isolation, reactivity

The last few years, especially 2020, presented long-term care facilities with a unique set of challenges. The virus swept through facilities across Kentucky and hurting vulnerable populations the most before any vaccines to combat it were approved.

""The hardest part of course, was the isolation,"" Haynes said. With families not able to come inside for normal visits, Nazareth had to step up its use of technology, she added, including an iN2L system, bank teller mics and Zoom. iN2L stands for ""It's Never Too Late,"" which Haynes described as similar to a smart television.

Haynes said Nazareth likes being able to plan ahead, but COVID-19 put her in a position of being responsive to the changing tide of the pandemic. And all the while, families were stuck outside, unable to enter for physical visits for fear of bringing the virus to the most vulnerable.

""I've been involved in long-term care provision for many years,"" she said. ""And there was never a year like that one. And it was really two years. And of course, we're still in a precaution mode, and we're still testing.""

There were bright moments. Haynes said one night, elders had a wine tasting night, guided by a man in California through the smart TV. Staff, she said, ""could take everybody to Napa.""

Looking to the future

Haynes said her immediate goals at Nazareth for the next few years are stabilizing her workforce after losing some staff during the pandemic and struggling to attract employees to long-term care while the virus raged.

""How can we be more flexible? How can we be more creative?"" she asks herself. ""How can we create different time and work opportunities? We will never, obviously, be a remote workplace.""

What she can do is look at ways to be more flexible with the ways people want to work, she said, while still being a relationship and environment-first workplace.

""If we can get people in the door,"" she said, ""they see that it's a great place to be.""

By NANCY WEST, InDepthNH.org

JACKSON – Police have arrested Brandon Mitchell, 22, of Jackson, for the murder of Esmae Doucette, 23, at the Dana Place Apartments, according to Attorney General John Formella.

At about 7:24 p.m. on Nov. 30, Jackson police were dispatched to a reported gunshot injury at the Dana Place Apartments on Route 16 where they found Doucette suffering from an apparent gunshot wound.

Doucette was transported to Memorial Hospital in North Conway where lifesaving measures were attempted; however, she eventually succumbed to the gunshot wound and was pronounced dead on Dec. 2.

“As a result of the investigation into the circumstances of the shooting of Ms. Doucette, an arrest warrant was obtained charging Mr. Mitchell with one charge of Second Degree Murder, contrary to New Hampshire RSA 630:1-b, I(b). Mr. Mitchell is alleged to have recklessly caused the death of Ms. Doucette under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life, by shooting Ms. Doucette with a firearm,” Formella said in a news release.

Mitchell is expected to be arraigned on Dec. 5 in Carroll County Superior Court, at a time to be determined.

In 2018 the Conway Daily Sun reported that the Dana Place Inn was being renovated for long-term rental apartments about five miles north of Jackson Village by owner Richard D. Levine.

The Dana Place Inn was owned by Malcolm and Betty Jennings who were murdered on Jan. 16, 1985, and their home near the inn was set on fire.

The murders went unsolved for a time, but authorities eventually said they believed the murders were the work of Glyde Earl Meek, 49, the ex-convict boyfriend of the Jennings’s daughter Page, 21. Their bodies were found 12 days after the Jackson slayings in a burned shack near Gainesville, Fla., in an apparent murder-suicide. But the mystery went on for a long time as their bodies were so badly burned it took experts to piece together what happened and have Page Jennings and Glyde Earl Meek declared dead.",Q4

Hochul said Monday.

The governor signed legislation and announced new funding and steps being taken by state police aimed at curbing the growing black market for the exhaust components coveted by crooks for their resale value.

“We’re going to double down on these efforts because this is a serious problem,” Hochul said during a signing ceremony at a State Police barracks in Suffolk County, Long Island. “You shouldn’t have to go to bed at night wondering if someone is stealing this valuable commodity out of your own driveway.”

The new law will impose restrictions on selling catalytic converters and require all qualified dealerships to carry etching kits to engrave serial numbers onto the converters so they can be more easily tracked if stolen.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced new actions to increase interagency vehicle and catalytic converter theft enforcement in high-theft areas by targeting unauthorized and illegal vehicle dismantlers, or “chop shops,” on Monday, Oct. 17, 2022.

Catalytic converters are emission control devices that aid in reducing the amount of pollution produced by gas-fueled vehicles and contain precious metals such as platinum, rhodium and palladium. Prices for the parts have skyrocketed in recent years due to supply chain issues and the cost to replace them can run into the thousands.

According to the NYPD, catalytic converter thefts have almost quadrupled so far this year in the five boroughs.

There have been 5,548 reported thefts of the devices in the city as of Aug. 14, in comparison to 1,505 during the same period in 2021.

Governor also signed legislation (S.9428/ A.1940-E) to combat the theft of catalytic converters, which imposes restrictions on the purchase, sale, and possession of catalytic converters by vehicle dismantlers and scrap processers.

The bill signed by Hochul on Monday will see the state classify catalytic converters as a major component vehicle part, which will require vehicle dismantlers to maintain records of them. It also requires dealerships to stock etching kits.

“We’re holding the dismantlers and the scrap dealers to a much higher standard,” bill sponsor Sen. Diane Savino (D-Staten Island) said. “People should not have to buy insurance for an auto part. They shouldn’t have to climb under their own car and put an alarm on their catalytic converter.”

Hochul is also directing the state police to work with local law enforcement agencies on increasing enforcement and announced that the state is making $20 million is available to help departments and sheriffs’ offices invest in new technology.

The money will be doled out by the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services, which is seeking seeking applications for license plate readers, mobile and fixed surveillance cameras, drones and other devices departments request.",Q4
https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/california-low-rider-association-looking-to-overturn-ban-of-cruising-on-la-streets/,California Low Rider Association looking to overturn ban of cruising on LA streets,"A local group is working hard to repeal a series of laws and ordinances that ban lowriders from cruising Los Angeles city streets, claiming that the rules are a glaring example of systemic racism.

Gathered in East Los Angeles Friday evening, dozens of ""cruisers,"" or people who hit the streets to flaunt their custom-built lowriders, hoping to celebrate the culture that makes their community so special.

Lowriding is an iconic representation of Latino culture, a tradition that has lived in for decades, despite a number of ordinances outlawing the activity.

""It's culture, like a brotherhood or sisterhood of community of car enthusiasts,"" said Vicente Quiñones, one of the many gathered Friday. ""It's a mental health release of running the hamster wheel of the 9-to-5.""

He and his wife, Lorraine, are members of the California Lowrider Alliance, a coalition of car enthusiasts from nearly 20 cities and counties throughout Southern California working to repeal the laws and ordinances banning their favorite pastime.

""We cruise with this stigma or fear in the back of our mind that there's a potential for us to be pulled over,"" Lorraine said. ""We don't want to repeal the ordinance only within our own city and county, but we want it to be statewide.""

Currently, Los Angeles County has an ordinance outlawing cruising, which notes that anyone driver past a certain point more than twice in a six-hour window can be cited.

While they know that traditional stigma associates the activity with gang-related culture, they're looking to turn the corner and drive people down a different path.

""You think we're going to jeopardize thousands of dollars that we put int our cars and the love to gang bang, it's not like that,"" said Art Acosta, another member of the California Lowrider Alliance.

A former gang member himself, he's hoping that his past experiences will give him an upper hand in reaching out to younger generations.

""We grew up in all that, so we know what it is and we want better for our kids.""

Quiñones is currently working with members of Los Angeles County and several state lawmakers looking to make the change in the near future.

""This is our community,"" she said. ""We actually live here and that's why we want to cruise here. We want to support our own community.""

She's hoping to develop a safe cruising plan with lawmakers, which will also call for public input before submission. On top of that, Quiñones is also working to draft a State Senate bill that would repeal the ban of cruising, which will be introduced in January.",Q4

Two members of the Rochdale grooming gang have lost an appeal against deportation after a seven-year legal battle.

Adil Khan, 51, and Qari Abdul Rauf, 52, were told they would be sent back to Pakistan after release from jail for the public good.

They were both convicted of a catalogue of child sex offences in May 2012.

Immigration judges ruled their challenge against deportation on human rights grounds had failed.

The appeal was heard at an immigration tribunal in June with a decision made in August, but judges have only just released their legal ruling.

It stated Khan had shown a “breath-taking lack of remorse” and in his and Rauf’s case there was a “very strong public interest” in them being kicked out of the UK.

BBC One drama Three Girls told the story of the child sex abuse in Rochdale and then failings by authorities

Khan had told the hearing he wanted to stay in the UK to be a “role model” for his son and “teach him right from wrong”.

Both men tried to use human rights laws as reasons not to be removed and said they both had certificates “renouncing” their Pakistani citizenship.

The pair, along with another man – Abdul Aziz – had fought and lost a long legal battle against an order depriving them of UK citizenship, the prelude to deportation, losing a final Court of Appeal ruling in 2018.

During the appeal hearing it emerged Aziz, a ringleader of the gang, had been allowed to remain in the UK because he had also renounced his Pakistani citizenship but earlier than the other two and just days before the Court of Appeal ruling.

Failure to deport any of the men has led to anger in Rochdale, where victims were living alongside their tormentors.

Khan got a 13-year-old girl pregnant, but denied he was the father, then met another girl, 15, and trafficked her for others to abuse, using violence when she complained.

Rauf, a father-of-five, trafficked a 15-year-old girl, driving her to secluded areas to sexually abuse her in his taxi and ferry her to a flat in Rochdale where he and others abused her.

Nine men were jailed for their part in the gang. Police said as many as 47 girls were groomed by them.

The abuse became the focus of a BBC One drama which outlined various failings by local authorities.

For two years from early 2008, girls as young as 12 were plied with alcohol and drugs and gang-raped in rooms above takeaway shops and ferried to different flats in taxis where cash was paid to use the girls.

During the tribunal hearing Khan denied the grooming offences, saying his prosecution was motivated by racism and claimed he could not groom anyone as he could not speak English.

Home Office lawyers argued the case had taken a “very long time” and it was in the public interest to deport both men “as soon as possible”.",Q4

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/06/magazine/lydia-millet-dinosaurs.html,The Climate Novelist Who Transcends Despair,"An hour after I arrived at my hotel, which was hidden among the cactuses on the edge of Saguaro National Park, Millet drove over with two bottles of red wine. (She wasn’t sure whether I would prefer Pinot or Malbec.) Technically the hotel did not allow outside visitors, but she is not one to be deterred by a rule as silly as that. While moths divebombed into our cups and monsoon lightning sparked over the Tucson Mountains, she reminisced about the years before the hotel was purchased by its current owners, when she used to break in and explore the grounds. This was when the buildings were in their “entropic state.” Once she saw a bobcat and her kittens.

Millet, who is 53, is tall, with snow white hair (dyed black at the tips), a commanding voice and a habit of continuously reapplying lipstick. She speaks in paragraphs and can seem charmingly old-fashioned — pronouncing “forehead” as “forrid” and “been” as “bean” — but with an edge of deadpan humor, like some kind of Gen X duchess. She describes animals as “magnetic” and is also a magnet for them. There was the time she was walking through the West Village and a “river of rats” came out of nowhere, swelled around her and then just disappeared. (“I like rats. I wasn’t bothered.”) Or the time she put her hand under her pillow and a scorpion stung her — twice. (She texted a doctor friend to ask what to do, a decision that may sound like pure common sense but which she derides as “really insecure.”) Earlier in the summer, when I visited her in Maine, where she has a second home, she greeted me with the words, “I want to show you a dead chipmunk.” When no living or dead creature is immediately present, she has facts at the ready about the mating habits of tarantulas, the episodic memory of hummingbirds, the strange history of excommunicating animals for their crimes and how beavers are transforming the Alaskan tundra.

‘It’s really important to live in a world where not everything is known. It’s not enough to have sameness. It’s not enough to have just each other.’

Despite her critical success — she was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2010 for her story collection “Love in Infant Monkeys” and for the National Book Award in 2020 for her novel “A Children’s Bible” — Millet has not, like so many of her peers, pursued a life in academia. Instead, she works 30 hours a week writing and editing news releases and other communications at the Center for Biological Diversity, an activist group devoted to protecting endangered species. She likes the health insurance, but that’s not the reason she keeps the job. Millet is “deeply devoted” to the center and its staff. “Writing and conservation are both aspects of vocation for me,” she said. She wouldn’t feel like herself if she didn’t write novels and stories, but “it feels self-indulgent to do only that. It’s not the same as action.”

“Self-indulgent” is on a list of things Millet has no time for. “Navel-gazing” and “myopic,” too. (I think this is why she can’t explain the killing of the Fowler’s toad: She’s not interested enough in herself to identify a motive.) She likes fiction that goes deep into consciousness or interiority — interiority, after all, is one of the things fiction does best — but she needs it to have some connection to a bigger context or world. Her books blend a sense of vertiginous wonder, what her best friend, the writer Jenny Offill, calls a “sensitivity to the sublime,” with an oddball, screwball, sometimes manic comic sensibility. (The critic Christian Lorentzen told me that he considers Millet one of the 10 funniest living American writers.) Her early novels were satirical and outrageous. She wrote characters such as an insect-collecting sadist who sells his daughter in marriage (“Omnivores”), a delusional pornographer (“Everyone’s Pretty”) and a woman who, recently out of prison, becomes obsessed with George H.W. Bush (“George Bush: Dark Prince of Love”). She has also written a thriller; a novel about the inventors of the atom bomb coming back to life; a trilogy involving real estate development, zoos and taxidermy; and a few novels for children and young adults. Millet’s penchant for experimentation is such that if she gets bored, she’ll throw a strange or improbable twist into a plot just to keep things interesting for herself. Take, for example, “Mermaids in Paradise,” in which a tropical honeymoon is disrupted by the discovery of, yes, literally, mermaids.",Q4

FORT WORTH, Texas — The weekends are packed with thousands of bar patrons in the West 7th area of Fort Worth. There are 20 different bars for people to choose from within a few blocks of each other.

But not everyone converging on the popular weekend destination goes inside the bars to drink.

So now, Fort Worth city leaders are scheduled to vote on an ordinance to stop people from drinking alcohol on the street. Right now, there are no rules against having open containers in this part of the city.

Fatima Garcia and her friends enjoy the nightlife in the West 7th area. Garcia didn't even realize that there were no current rules in place to stop people from having an open container that contained alcohol on the street.

Either way, they have always tried to avoid areas where bar patrons appear intoxicated on the street or in parking lots.

""I'm usually on the street a little calmer,"" said Garcia, ""So you don't see a lot of people very intoxicated as you do over there. But you will see people drinking inside their cars before they.""

Marquis Hill lives on 7th Street and has seen it all. He and his friends enjoy the nightlife. But, they have also seen when things have gotten out of control on the weekends when someone has had too much to drink.

""Some days it's quiet. I mean, like, it all depends,"" said Hill, ""Mostly Fridays, like, it gets kind of crazy, very crazy. Some days it gets wild.""

Because of some of those wild times and after meeting with bar owners and law enforcement leaders, Fort Worth city councilwoman Elizabeth Beck drafted an ordinance restricting open containers.

It would allow officers to issue $500 citations to people drinking alcohol on the streets inside a designated area around the 7th Street area.

Beck serves as the council member for that area. She was surprised to learn that there were not some restrictions on open containers.

Instead of waiting for things to get worse, Beck decided an open container restriction ordinance now is better. Beck believes the popular nightlife area is important to the Fort Worth community.

She believes that the majority of young adults who visit the bars are law-abiding citizens and come to enjoy the weekend.

""We believe is in large part a lot of underage folks that can't get into the establishments. And so, they mill around the area with open containers that they brought from another location,"" said Beck, ""the West 7th district is one of the top producers in alcohol sales statewide pretty consistently.""

She and the full council will vote on the ordinance restricting open containers at a city hall meeting on Nov. 8.

""We will take the vote on Tuesday per ordinances and state law. It has to be published in the Star-Telegram twice before it can go into effect,"" said Beck, ""And so that's about eight to 10 days after we take the vote on Tuesday. I'm currently working with our police department, our internal communications department, and our partners at other agencies like TCU, to make sure that we are communicating to patrons that something has changed in the area.""

Beck's goal is to also make sure that officers patrolling the bar district remain friendly, yet firm, about the change in policy. The open container violation will be a Class C misdemeanor, which can have a fine of up to $500.

Although the West 7th area is packed with thousands of partygoers on the weekend, the new ordinance will impact more than just the bar area. Beck's ordinance will include an area just north of the bar district, which is seeing a lot of development and would likely become another area of the city that will attract people to nightlife activities.

Beck said, ""Just like being in the traditional bar district, it was just an effort to recognize that this is a potential future.""

Emil Bragdon owns five of the 20 bars and welcomes the open container restrictions. His staff and other bar owners have bartenders, servers and security personnel trained to recognize when someone in their establishments had too much to drink.

But, they cannot monitor what happens on the street outside their establishments. Bragdon believes the change will help with safety if nothing else.",Q4

Officials in Chesapeake, Va., confirmed in a statement that the Walmart supervisor who fatally shot six coworkers inside the store on Tuesday left a note in his phone in which he described being harassed.

""Sorry everyone but I did not plan this I promise things just fell in place like I was led by the Satan,"" Andre Bing wrote in a letter titled ""death note"" that was stored on his phone.

""My only wish would have been to start over from scratch and that my parents would have paid closer attention to my social deficits.""

Police also confirmed on Friday that Bing used a 9mm handgun, which was legally purchased the morning of the shooting. A box of ammunition and a receipt for the gun were discovered during a police search of his home.

The note, which authorities redacted in a several places to protect the names of specific people, described how Bing ""lost his dignity"" when he believed his phone was hacked.

""I was harassed by idiots with low intelligence and a lack of wisdom,"" he wrote. ""The associates gave me evil twisted grins, mocked me and celebrated my down fall the last day.""

AP This photo provided by Virginia DMV shows Andre Bing.

Bing was found dead inside the breakroom from what police say was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Police say he had no criminal history and was dressed in civilian clothing, without body armor.

In a statement, Walmart said Bing had been employed with the company since 2010. His position at the time of the shooting was ""overnight team lead.""

Tuesday night's violence was the nation's second high-profile mass shooting in four days and the second high-profile supermarket shooting this year.

Police have identified the victims as Brian Pendleton, 38; Kellie Pyle, 52; Lorenzo Gamble, 43; Randy Blevins, 70; and Fernando Chavez-Barron, 16, who were all from Chesapeake. Tyneka Johnson, 22, of nearby Portsmouth, was also among the dead.

A Walmart spokesperson confirmed in an email that all of the victims worked for the company.

Another four people were hospitalized in the shooting, which happened just after 10 p.m. ET.. Police say there were about 50 people in the store at the time. Many were stocking up ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.

JonBenet's mother reported the 6-year-old missing to police on the morning of Dec. 26, 1996, after finding a lengthy ransom note demanding $118,000 in exchange for JonBenet. The girl's father, John Ramsey, found her body later that same day in their basement.

""[I]t appears the governor’s office has brought pressure on the Boulder police to finally accept help from outside to solve the murder of our daughter Jon Benet [sic],"" John Ramsey said in a statement to Fox News correspondent Laura Ingle. ""We have been fighting and praying for this almost from the beginning when it became obvious the Boulder police department was not equipped or experienced to deal with the unthinkable murder of an innocent child.""

The department, in addition to partnering with private DNA labs, said it will consult with the Colorado Cold Case Review Team, comprised of cold-case experts from across the state, at some point next year. BPD described the team as a tool to help further cold case investigations.

""This is positive,"" he wrote. ""Forward progress. More work has to be done to catch a killer but it can be done.""

An autopsy after JonBenet's death revealed that the girl died of strangulation and a blow to the head. The Boulder City Medical Examiner reported an 8 1/2-inch fracture on her skull. Authorities have not convicted any suspects in the case.

JONBENET RAMSEY COLD CASE: DNA EXPERT EXPLAINS HOW MYSTERY MIGHT BE SOLVED IN SHORT ORDER

BPD says it has investigated leads from more than 21,000 tips, letters and emails and traveled to 19 states to speak with more than 1,000 people about the case.

""This crime has left a hole in the hearts of many, and we will never stop investigating until we find JonBenet’s killer,"" Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold said in a Wednesday statement. ""That includes following up on every lead and working with our policing partners and DNA experts around the country to solve this tragic case. This investigation has always been and will continue to be a priority for the Boulder Police Department.""

The move comes as John Ramsey has made efforts in recent years to bring renewed attention to the case and find his daughter's killer. He helped release a petition in the spring of 2021, which has garnered more than 28,000 signatures, calling on Colorado Gov. Jared Polis to allow an independent agency to take over the investigation from BPD.

JONBENET RAMSEY MURDER: FAMILY ‘ENCOURAGED’ BY RENEWED INTEREST IN CASE, DNA TESTING POSSIBILITIES

The father of five has expressed deep disappointment with BPD's handling of the case over the last 26 years and believes independent research teams who have offered their assistance in the case have the ability to bring his daughter's killer to light. To do so, BPD must hand over the evidence in their custody so items can be re-tested for DNA to potentially build a profile of the suspect.

If they are able to build a more complete DNA profile of the suspect(s), that information can then be compared to millions of DNA profiles uploaded to public databases showing people’s unique genetic codes.

""The murder of JonBenet Ramsey is a terrible tragedy and sparked years of unanswered questions and theories. Our office has successfully prosecuted other cold case homicides and many murder cases,"" District Attorney Michael Dougherty said.

“At this point, the investigators are looking at all possibilities,” Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson told NBC’s “TODAY” show. “They don’t have a specific suspect.”

With the killer or killers still on the loose, on Wednesday Moscow Police Chief James Fry also walked back earlier statements made by the police that there was no ongoing threat to the community.

“We do not have a suspect at this time, and that individual is still out there,” Fry told reporters, according to the news outlet. “We cannot say there is no threat to the community.”

Although authorities still do not know who killed Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, Sunday morning in the off-campus home, new details are emerging about how they died.

In a report released Thursday by Moscow Police, Latah County Coroner Cathy Mabbutt ruled that all four students died Sunday morning after being stabbed to death in a quadruple homicide.

“It would have had to have been … not a pocket knife,” Mabbutt explained to NBC News of the autopsy results. “It would have been a bigger knife.”

The coroner believes the students were killed sometime after 2 a.m., according to the findings of an initial autopsy.

She called the victims’ wounds “pretty extensive” and noted she had never seen a crime scene quite like it.

“We have had multiple murders in the past, but nothing like this with four college students,” she said.

Moscow Mayor Art Bettge told ABC News that investigators believe the college students were killed sometime between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m., but their deaths were not reported until around noon.

Authorities have said that at the time of the murders, two other female roommates had been in the home, but were not injured.

Idaho State Police spokesman Aaron Snell told the news outlet on Thursday that authorities had not ruled the surviving roommates “in or out” as suspects at this time. He believes they could be “the key” to discovering what happened.

“Potentially they are witnesses, potentially they are victims,” he said.

He added that the women are “working and talking with detectives” and are being “very cooperative.”

The three female victims—Kernodle, Goncalves and Mogen—lived at the home while Chapin had been dating Kernodle and had been staying over.

Fry said on Saturday night Chapin and Kernodle had been at a party on campus while Goncalves and Mogen had been out at the bars before all four returned home to the property.

Mogen and Goncalves were spotted in video footage in line at a late-night food truck at about 1:41 a.m., where they were casually chatting as they waited for their food, according to CNN.

Kernodle’s father, Jeffrey Kernodle, told local station KTVK/KPHO he last heard from his daughter around midnight and “she was fine” and nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

“I have no idea. It doesn’t make sense,” he said. “The door locks with a number code. Every time you go, you have to go around the house because of the number code so they either knew that or went around and maybe found the slider door open.”

He said the autopsy report showed that she had tried to fight off her attacker and had “bruises” and was “torn by the knife.”

“She’s a tough kid,” he said. “Whatever she wanted to do, she could do it.”

Jeffrey visited his daughter on campus about a week before her death and said she had been a responsible kid.

“She had a life,” he said. “She got to see what it was like to have a boyfriend you live with. And she really turned around. She was really responsible. Helping him with his studies and stuff. I was really impressed.”

Chapin, a triplet, was remembered by his family as an easy-going guy who loved to make people laugh.

“He could read any situation and make it better,” his mom Stacy Chapin told The Associated Press. “He was just so carefree.”

As the family grieves his sudden loss, his mother said they’ve taken comfort in the type of person he was in life.

“We realized yesterday morning, watching information about our son being posted that didn’t come from us personally, that the greatest gift we could do for our son in this moment is be his voice,” she said.

All four slain students had been active members of the campus’ Greek life. According to the university, Kernodle was a junior majoring in marketing, while Mogen was a senior in marketing and Goncalves was a senior in general studies. Chapin was a freshman, CBS News reports.

SAN DIEGO — San Diego is on the forefront of what Governor Newsom is calling a ""bold new strategy"" to battle the homelessness crisis.

This week, San Diego brought together state, county and local leaders to begin the groundwork on launching California's new ""Care Court"" system.

This new program will use local courts to help provide treatment and housing to those who are mentally ill and on the streets.

San Diego is one of the first counties in California volunteering to launch this first-in-the-nation Care Court program, and hosted that inaugural meeting with leaders from throughout the state.

""We really rolled up our sleeves and got to work for how we're going to make Care Court work on the streets in San Diego next year,"" said County Board of Supervisors Nathan Fletcher, a strong supporter of the concept.

The meeting here in San Diego brought together judicial and medical leaders from throughout the state, as well as the six other counties, including Orange, Riverside and San Francisco, that are stepping up as early adopters of this program along with San Diego.

""I think we've got to try something new to address the situation on the streets,"" Fletcher told CBS 8.

Through this new approach, county courts will be empowered to order treatment for homeless people who are battling severe mental illness, such as schizophrenia.

A first responder, family member or clinician could refer a person to Care Court, and a civil court judge would then set a course of treatment, including medication, support services, and a plan for housing.

""It really is assessing how many people will this apply to, what services do we think they'll need, how do we get those services ready,"" he added.

Fletcher noted that one of the biggest challenges in gearing up for the launch of Care Court is staffing.

""We have a critical shortage of mental health and drug treatment staff, and we are now working to hire more people, recruit more people, train more people,"" he said. ""And so one of the biggest limiting factors right now is just the availability of services.""

Some homeless advocates have raised concerns over the legality of this program, which would force individuals into psychiatric treatment or into a conservatorship, if they fail to follow the court-ordered plan.

Fletcher noted that Care Court is targeted toward those who are most gravely ill and in need of help.

""At the end of the day when someone is lying on the street, clearly suffering in their own feces, clearly not able to take care of themselves, I don't think it is compassionate or humanitarian to leave them in that condition,"" he added.

""We've got to find a way to get them some help. Then when they're clear-minded, they can make decisions in terms of what they want to do when they move forward.""

Care Court is set to officially launch in October of next year, although Fletcher is hopeful that it could begin here in San Diego sooner, possibly in late summer.",Q4

But there is no legal limit on the number of terms a local school board member can serve in Ohio, so he decided to make one for himself.

“I don’t want to be a hypocrite. If I ran again that would put me on the board for like, close to ten years. I think that’s probably too much,” he said.

So near the end of a heated school board meeting on Nov. 21, Truax announced that he would not be running for re-election when his term ends in Dec. 2023, and he would be giving up his role as president in January.

“In my final months of my elected term, I will approach this job with the same enthusiasm and optimism as I’ve always had for Ashland City Schools, its employees, and most importantly, its students,” he said at the meeting.

Truax’s stint on the school board began in Nov. 2018 when he was unanimously chosen to replace outgoing board member Will Gravitt. At the time, the board chose him because of his passion for educating all students, and not just those that are college-bound, according to previous reporting by Ashland Source.

During his time, Truax and the board would have to navigate a contentious union contract negotiation, a pandemic that upended in-person education, and a recent battle over Ashland’s public library.

Out of all the challenges he faced, the pandemic was the toughest, Truax said.

“Because the decisions you make, it’s one thing to make decisions affecting someone’s education. It’s a totally other feeling you have when you’re making decisions that affect their health,” he said.

But the district’s response to the pandemic was also his proudest moment from his time on the board, he added.

“The way that I saw the administration, the teachers, non-certified staff, how they kind of rallied together at that time — obviously not everyone always believed in the direction we were headed, but I always felt like they trusted that we were trying to do the right thing for students at all times,” he said.

Truax said he “almost feels guilty” when people thank him for the work the board does. Whatever success the board had during Truax’s time is “100 percent” because of the district’s staff, he said.

“There’s no way we would have accomplished anything, or half of what we did without all the great people working there,” he said.",Q4
https://www.miragenews.com/terrorist-labels-can-they-ever-be-shed-916758/,Terrorist Labels: Can They Ever Be Shed?,"At the United Nations, an ombudsperson reviews who is on the list of terrorists from Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. If someone feels that they have been wrongly placed on the list and should be removed, they can request that their case should be reviewed. Since the establishment of the office in 2010, 63 people have been struck off the list on the basis of recommendations made by the ombudsperson. Those on the list are subjected to far-reaching sanctions, for example travel bans and the freezing of bank accounts. Dr Andrej Lang, a legal scholar from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU), takes stock of this issue in the American Journal of International Law.

The Office of the Ombudsperson for the United Nations' ""1267 Sanctions Regime"" was introduced in 2010 - under pressure from the European Court of Justice. The regime was established by the UN Security Council in 1999 to combat terrorism by the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. Its aim was to target members and supporters of terrorist organisations. The Taliban were later removed from the regime and the so-called Islamic State (ISIL) was added. ""International law has long permitted the Security Council to take economic sanctions against individual countries in order to maintain or restore international peace and security. However, these measures always affect an entire nation and its population. The sanctions regime was designed to allow taking targeted actions against individuals,"" explains legal scholar Dr Andrej Lang from MLU. The Security Council can decide whether individuals should be subjected to far-reaching sanctions. ""When a person is placed on this list, all United Nations Member States are obliged to freeze that person's accounts and restrict their freedom of movement by banning them from leaving the country,"" Lang adds. The measures aim to curb the financing of terrorism and thus prevent terrorist attacks.

However, according to Lang, the process for putting people on this list is problematic. The decisions are made by a UN Security Council committee that is staffed by diplomats. Sometimes a Member State will allude to confidential documents created by their secret service without submitting these to the other Member States. Even more problematic is that not everyone who is sanctioned has been notified directly that their name is on the list. ""There have been cases where a person suddenly could no longer pay his rent because his account had been frozen. That can derail his entire life,"" explains Lang. For his new study, the scholar examined the importance of the office of the ombudsperson and its work. It is an institution that persons can turn to if they believe they have been wrongly placed on the list. In addition to conducting an extensive review of the literature and publicly available UN documents, Lang also performed numerous interviews with diplomats, lawyers representing people on the list, and the three former ombudspersons. He used this material to produce the most comprehensive assessment of the ombudsperson's role to date and placed its work within the current legal discourse on international dispute settlement and security politics.

When a person on the list approaches the ombudsperson, she will start an investigation. At the end of these proceedings, the ombudsperson recommends whether the person should remain on or be removed from the list. This recommendation can be overruled only if all 15 members of the Sanctions Committee vote against it, or if the case is referred to the Security Council - neither of which has happened yet. ""This gives the ombudsperson a strong recommendation power,"" says Lang. Around 450 people have been placed on the terrorist list since it was first introduced, and 105 of these people have initiated proceedings with the ombudsperson. According to Lang, most of these cases have been resolved. In most instances, a recommendation is made to remove the person from the list and the UN member states have so far always complied with this recommendation except in one case. ""This is surprising since, in many cases, a number of states are convinced that the people deserved to remain on the list,"" says Lang. The researcher notes that the sheer amount of people removed from the list does not necessarily point to a serious flaw in the sanctions regime: ""In the first few years, some people were wrongly placed on the terrorist list. However, if you look at the list now, for most people it seems justifiable that they were originally put on the list because they were or are active for al-Qaida or the ISIL."" However, after a certain amount of time, this status has to be scrutinised. This applies, for example, to people who were convicted by a national court and have served their prison sentences - but remain on the list.

Lang believes the work of the ombudsperson embodies a new trend in international law. ""In the coming decades, it is likely that fewer international courts will be established than in the era following the Cold War. While the West's influence wains, states like China and India are gaining in geopolitical influence, yet these states are not keen on creating such institutions. Under these conditions of a changing world order, dispute settlement bodies such as an ombudsperson constitute a compromise that may provide a better solution than it would initially appear - even if they do not always meet our Western standards for the rule of law,"" concludes Lang.

https://thediplomat.com/2022/11/making-siachen-a-mountain-of-climate-responsibility/,Making Siachen a Mountain of Climate Responsibility,"Climate protection on the disputed glacier is important for both India and Pakistan – and could even jumpstart an improvement in their relationship.

On November 14, at the COP27 Summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, Pakistan was chosen among the seven “path-finder” countries eligible to receive Global Shield against Climate Risks funding. The eligible countries – also including Bangladesh, Costa Rica, Fiji, Ghana, the Philippines, and Senegal – were announced jointly by a grouping of 58 climate-vulnerable economies, known as the Vulnerable 20 Group of Finance Ministers (V20), and the Group of Seven (G-7). The fund — with an initial contribution of 170 million euros (around $175 million) from Germany and more than 40 million euros (around $41 million) from other countries — is aimed at having pre-arranged, ready-to-deploy disaster relief assistance for the provision of social protection to affected communities through insurance and other means.

Pakistan was selected for the fund because only a few months ago devastating climate change-induced floods killed 1,100 people and affected 33 million more in the country. Pakistan suffered massive floods in 2010 as well, in which 1,700 people lost their lives and 20 million were otherwise affected.

The two floods might be just the beginning of massive climate calamities in the region. A recent study based on satellite data from the past 40 years shows that all the Himalayan glaciers have consistently lost 18 inches of their mass from 2000 to 2016, which is double the rate of loss from 1975 to 2000. Another recent study by the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), concluded that over one-third of the Himalayan glaciers will vanish by the turn of the century – even if the rise in global temperature is restricted to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

While being awarded funding is a good omen for Pakistan, the Global Shield against Climate Risks is not, in fact, going to “shield” Pakistan from natural disasters of similar magnitude, which are likely to occur in the future. The fund will only provide post-disaster relief or, at best, some support with disaster preparedness and management. Climate adaptation and mitigation would remain within the ambit of Pakistan’s own policy responses.

Pakistan does not contribute significantly to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and thus cannot do much about the overall situation. It does, however, need to take policy action and solicit regional support on other aspects of climate mitigation and adaptation.

India is no less susceptible to the impacts of climate change itself. Around the same time as Pakistan’s floods in 2022, the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh faced floods that affected 245,000 people.

The Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) glaciers are the lifeline for tens of millions of South Asians. The rapid glacial melt not only threatens water security in the long term, but in the short term is contributing to the region’s devastating flood events. Preserving these glaciers will take joint efforts.

Nevertheless, India and Pakistan are finding it hard to engage in a meaningful dialogue on anything under the sun at this point – even on COVID-19. Pakistan’s then-minister of state for health raised the longstanding Kashmir dispute with India during a video conference on the subject under the aegis of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).

Given the ICIMOD’s doomsday prediction, not engaging on climate action should no longer be considered an option by both India and Pakistan. The regional climate emergency should alert India and Pakistan to not only cooperate on protecting the fragile ecosystem of the HKH through climate action but treat it as a shared responsibility.

The best starting point would be the demilitarization of the highest battleground on planet earth: the Siachen glacier, on which the armies of the two countries have been lodged since 1984. There have been no active hostilities in the area for more than 20 years now, yet the two armies are constantly deployed, fighting the elements of nature at temperatures reaching up to 40 degrees below freezing.

While the two countries are bickering over where their un-demarcated border lies in the area, the presence of their armies is destroying the fragile ecosystem. They need to instead shift their focus from control to responsibility. The two countries should demilitarize the region like it was before 1984 and take responsibility as the environmental custodians of their respective parts of the glacial region, i.e., the areas currently under their respective military controls. This would entail an agreement not only ensuring the non-remilitarization of the region but also non-habitation in addition to commitments not to divert or extract natural resources (such as water, minerals, etc.) in one administrative area without consultation with the other government.

The agreement could oblige the two governments to exchange environmental protection data from their respective areas of climate jurisdiction and coordinate any civilian exploration activity in the region, whether scientific or resource-oriented. The United Nations Military Observers’ Group for India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) – which has been observing the Line of Control (LOC) dividing the disputed region of Kashmir between Indian- and Pakistani-administered territories since 1949 – could be given the additional responsibility to remotely monitor remilitarization in the un-demarcated Siachen region.

As I wrote in a previous article:

Similarly, foreign tourists, mountaineers, or scientists could be obliged to obtain visas for both India and Pakistan and special permission from both governments for visiting any part of the demilitarized zone in the administrative domain of any country. At the same time, joint exploratory and research activities conducted by India and Pakistan with official permissions and coordination of both countries will have to be encouraged to gradually diminish the relevance of the AGPL [the Actual Ground Position Line of the two militaries, dividing the control of the un-demarcated area between the two countries].

An agreement on demilitarization of the glacier for climate action will demonstrate to the world as well as the people of India and Pakistan that the governments of the two states are serious about protecting the future generations of South Asia. More importantly, it could result in a shift in focus from control to responsibility on some of the thorniest issues between the two countries, like water sharing and the Kashmir dispute as a whole.

While Manmohan Singh, the former prime minister of India, had called for turning Siachen into a “mountain of peace” more than 15 years ago, contemporary realities necessitate its transition into a “mountain of climate responsibility.”",Q4

Darnzell Dantonio Drummer, 19, made his first court appearance since his arrest on Nov. 8.

He is accused of firing gunshots that struck a pair of neighboring houses in the 800 block of South Monroe Street on Nov. 4.

Bullets entered both homes. In one, 43-year-old Joanie Elaine Webb — a two-time cancer survivor, according to friends — was shot in the head. She was later pronounced dead at IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital.

In the other house, a bullet struck a 37-year-old woman in the torso. She survived.

Deputy Police Chief Melissa Criswell said neither woman had been an intended target of the gunfire.

Drummer reportedly told police he came to the 800 block of South Monroe after a threat was made on Snapchat to harm an acquaintance who had been at one of the houses. Drummer allegedly said he fired shots after seeing a man crouching outside that residence.

In court on Monday, Drummer told Delaware Circuit Court 4 Judge John Feick he had no financial resources and asked for appointment of a public defender.

Trial for Drummer — also charged with aggravated battery and criminal recklessness — was set for March 27. He continues to be held without bond in the Delaware County jail.

https://news.yahoo.com/elon-musk-bought-twitter-now-124407564.html,Elon Musk has bought Twitter. Now what?,"Elon Musk’s $44bn Twitter takeover has finally gone through, and is likely to bring the biggest changes to the social media company since its launch in 2006.

After six months of legal sparring, Musk closed the deal before a Friday 5pm deadline and avoided a high-stakes showdown in the Delaware Chancery Court.

Late on Thursday it was reported that he had fired top executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal.

The 51-year-old has promised profound and immediate changes to the way Twitter is run, as part of his grand ambitions of quadrupling the number of active users on the platform to one billion and turn a niche platform favoured by journalists and politicians into a global digital town square.

More of his plans include loosening content moderation controls, eliminating bots, restoring banned accounts and removing what he describes as Twitter’s “far left” bias.

And that’s just for starters. In tweets and text messages to investors, Musk has said he wants Twitter to become an “everything app”, where users go to complete daily tasks from encrypted messaging to peer-to-peer payments, e-commerce purchases to social networking.

The acquisition is likely to usher in dramatic changes to the user experience that will likely please some and infuriate others, Jason Mozer, a senior analyst at The Motley Fool who closely follows the tech sector, tells The Independent.

“He’s buying this in order to inflict a lot of change and that requires a lot of work. Hopefully it’s something he’s committed to, he can be a bit mercurial,” Mr Mozer said in an interview this week. “He may be biting off more than he can chew in the near term, it’s not like everything is humming along nicely at Twitter.”

By some estimates , the true market value of Twitter stock is be around half the $54.20-per-share Mr Musk and his fellow investors are handing over.

He has already sold billions of dollars worth of Tesla shares, and waived due diligence before agreeing to the deal.

“Given the price he’s paying, he is going to need to figure out how to monetise the platform more effectively,” says Mr Mozer. “Sometimes he shoots first and aims second, and that might have got himself into a little bit of trouble here.”

A ‘toxic place’

Musk has said he’s a “free speech absolutist”, (despite blocking many of his detractors on the platform), and has suggested that Twitter should allow any content that doesn’t break local speech laws.

“My preference is to hew close to the laws of countries in which Twitter operates,” he tweeted on 9 May . “If the citizens want something banned, then pass a law to do so, otherwise it should be allowed.”

Expanding on what he meant by this at an event in May, Musk said any speech that is “destructive to the world” or “wrong and bad” could be subject to penalties.

Content moderators have tried to rein in racism, disinformation and vitriol on the site. By opening the floodgates, experts warn Mr Musk could risk alienating newcomers.

Mr Mozer says that Musk will likely follow the lead of companies like Google and Facebook by using artificial intelligence to moderate harmful content.

“Everybody just loves to say free speech, but it must come with consequences,” he says. “I think Twitter has a bad reputation right now as being a fairly toxic place, if you go against the grain, people will come down on you.”

Musk complained about the number of bots, or spam accounts, on Twitter while attempting to derail the acquisition, and has promised to cleanse the site of fakes.

“I think that Twitter unfortunately is riddled with that stuff,” Mr Mozer says.

Eliminating the fake accounts would go a long way to making it a more engaging platform, he believes.

Mr Musk has also suggested he would make the algorithm publicly available for users to view and suggest changes to.

Trump’s return

Along with relaxing what’s said on the platform, Musk has also said he will move to reinstate former president Donald Trump and others who have been permanently banned from Twitter.

During his presidency, Mr Trump frequently used the app to fire political appointees, taunt world leaders, and spread misinformation.

After he used Twitter to incite rioters on January 6, Mr Trump was suspended and ultimately banned for breaching the guidelines.

“Banning Trump from Twitter didn’t end Trump’s voice, it will amplify it among the right and this is why it’s morally wrong and flat out stupid,” Musk said at the Financial Times’ Future of the Car conference in May.

For his part, Mr Trump has said he wouldn’t return to Twitter even if he was allowed back on.

“I was disappointed by the way I was treated by Twitter. I won’t be going back on Twitter,” he told CNBC in April.

Under Twitter’s previous guidelines, it prohibited threats and glorification of violence, targeted abuse and harassment, and hateful conduct based on race, ethnicity, religion and gender.

Mr Mozer says the rules have not been consistently enforced. Letting the former president back on could work out favourably, but only if Twitter spells out exactly where it will draw the line.

“If you let them back on with a very clear and concise policy, then you can act from there on,” he says.

Others to have been permanently banned from the platform include far right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, Roger Stone (twice in 2017 and again after Mr Musk announced his purchase in 2022), Infowars hate monger Alex Jones, white supremacist David Duke, and Marjorie Taylor Greene.

The ‘everything app’

“Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app,” Musk tweeted in early October.

Advertisement Advertisement

Everything apps are a way of life in Asia, and tech developers have been trying to emulate them in other parts of the world.

WeChat, which has more than one billion users according to some estimates, is considered the benchmark.

“You basically live on WeChat in China,” Mr Musk said during a Q and A session with Twitter employees in June.

He told employees the move into encrypted messaging, ride hailing and payments was part of a strategy to increase Twitter’s users numbers from around 237 million to “at least a billion.”

The Motley Fool’s tech expert Jason Mozer says he remains “highly sceptical” that Musk will be able to pull this off.

“We know that China has WeChat and that works for them. But in the western world, people don’t want all of that stuff under one roof,” he said. “On the consumer side, you’re putting all of our eggs in one basket. If Twitter goes down, you don’t have any way of getting my stuff done.”

He said Facebook had tried to turn itself into an everything app, but ended up spreading itself too thin: “I don’t think that’s what most people want out of Twitter.”

‘Mere pawns in a game played by billionaires’

The Washington Post recently revealed that Musk planned to axe 75 per cent of Twitter’s employees, reducing the San Francisco-headquartered company’s headcount from 7,500 to just 2,000.

In response, Twitter employees wrote to their new overlord in a letter obtained by Time of their concerns about his “negligent layoff threats”.

The plan would hurt Twitter’s ability to “serve the public conversation,” employees wrote.

“A threat of this magnitude is reckless, undermines our users’ and customers’ trust in our platform, and is a transparent act of worker intimidation.”

The letter signed off by demanding respect and protection and not “to not be treated as mere pawns in a game played by billionaires.”

The threat will likely cause an “exodus of talent” from Twitter, Jason Mozer says, and retaining the best and brightest employees and attracting new talent would be crucial to improving the platform.

Consolidation of power

Musk has added the social media platform to a burgeoning portfolio of assets under his control.

These include electronic car maker Tesla, spacecraft manufacturer SpaceX, satellite internet provider Starlink, brain-chip pioneer Neuralink and tunnel venture The Boring Company.

In recent months, Mr Musk has used his platform to personally attack US president Joe Biden, pledge allegiance to the Republican Party, make unsolicited suggestions on how to end the war in Ukraine, and suggest allowing China to take control of parts of Taiwan.

A recent Bloomberg report claimed that the Biden administration was weighing subjecting Mr Musk’s business ventures to national security reviews - a charge flatly denied by the White House.

Given his efforts at freelance diplomacy, ability to turn off internet access in conflict zones, and dictate the political conversation, concerns remain about having so much power, money and geopolitical influence concentrated in the hands of one person.

“When you have someone who is running so many things that are so geared toward the future, the consolidation of power is extremely dangerous,” Mr Mozer says. “Elon is a fascinating personality, some people are just fully bought in on him and everything that he does, and don’t even question a thing. It is almost cult-like to an extent. I wish him all the best and man-oh-man his plate is full.”",Q4
https://afn.net/science-tech/2022/12/14/twitter-files-newest-revelation-how-howling-activists-banned-trump/,'Twitter files' newest revelation: How howling activists banned Trump,"Another behind-the-scenes story has emerged about Twitter and its left-wing activists, this time about their internal debate over permanently banning Donald Trump, and a critic of the website points out the hypocrisy of those who were involved.

In the fifth installment of Twitter emails and internal communications, which are being referred to as the “Twitter files,” journalist Bari Weiss describes debate among unnamed employees that occurred before Trump was banned January 8, 2021.

“Maybe because I am from China,” one Twitter employee, concerned about a ban, writes, “I deeply understand how censorship can destroy the public conservation.”

“I understand this fear,” a co-worker replies, “but I also think it’s important to understand that censorship by a government is very different than censorship of the government.”

That observation is an interesting one considering the public has learned Twitter’s executives collaborated with the federal government to bury Hunter Biden’s laptop scandal.

Mark Meckler, who recently served as an interim CEO at Parler, tells AFN the newest “Twitter files” story makes it clear Twitter broke its own rules when it banned Trump.

“There was an employee uprising,” Meckler points out, “and they essentially forced the banning of Trump’s account.”

Sure enough, the internal messages cited by Weiss describe a corporate workplace that organized to demand their employer chase Trump from the social media site. Those employees went to The Washington Post with an open letter to pressure then-CEO Jack Dorsey to take action even though several Twitter executives were admitting at the time that Trump had not violated any specific policy.

Reacting to the now-uncovered communications, Musk summarized them in a Twitter post that said a ""sitting U.S. president"" was deplatformed by people who knew he had not violated Twitter's rules.

In her Twitter thread about Twitter vs. Trump, Weiss pivots to point out the social media site that banned a U.S. president took no action in 2018 after Iran’s tyrannical leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called Israel a “malignant cancerous tumor” that must be “removed and eradicated.”

In another incident, Twitter deleted the tweet from Malaysia’s former prime minister who said Muslims have a “right” to kill “millions of French people.” He was allowed to keep his account, however.

She also cited tweets by other prominent foreign leaders who called for violence but who went unpunished despite such inflammatory talk.

All of those Twitter posts, Meckler points out, violate Twitter’s code of conduct.

“I think it has an outsize influence in politics both in America around the world,” Meckler concludes. “So I think Twitter becoming a much more neutral platform definitely is a big deal.”

Now that Musk owns and is overseeing Twitter, conservative activist Gary Bauer tells AFN the billionaire spent $44 billion on a risky social media site because he supports the fundamental right of free speech.

""It is still possible Twitter will go bankrupt before this is over,"" Bauer says. ""But he's risked that money and he's fighting as hard as he can.""

https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/365038,Republican Jewish coalition bans George Santos over false claims,"The Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC) announced on Tuesday that it is banning incoming Rep. George Santos (R-NY) for falsifying his resume and making misleading statements about having Jewish ancestry.

Santos found himself under intense scrutiny after reporters debunked a statement on his campaign website that said his mother was Jewish and that his grandparents, who were born in Brazil, according to the Forward, ""fled Jewish persecution in Ukraine, settled in Belgium, and again fled persecution during WWII.""

“We are very disappointed in Congressman-elect Santos. He deceived us and misrepresented his heritage. In public comments and to us personally, he previously claimed to be Jewish. He has begun his tenure in Congress on a very wrong note,” the RJC said. “He will not be welcome at any future RJC event.""

Santos was a speaker at the RJC’s leadership conference in November. He also described himself as a “proud American Jew” in a campaign document, according to the Washington Examiner.

But Santos recently admitted that he had exaggerated parts of his resume and was not clear about his heritage.

“I never claimed to be Jewish,” he told the New York Post. “I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background, I said I was ‘Jew-ish.'”

On Monday, Santos reiterated he still identifies as “Jew-ish” despite reports showing that his grandparents were Catholics born in Brazil, not Jews who fled the Nazis in Europe as he previously claimed.

The Long Island Republican also questioned why “people are rushing to disinherit me from being Jewish” given his support for Jews and Israel at a time of rising antisemitism.

The comments came during Santos’ first media appearances since the New York Times published a story last week raising questions about virtually ever aspect of the Republican’s resume.

“Even though I’ve always I’ve always said I’m Catholic, I grew up Catholic, I’ve always loved and had a deep respect for my Jewish heritage and I will continue to,” Santos told a reporter from City & State, a publication covering New York politics. In similar comments to the New York Post, he said, “I never claimed to be Jewish. I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background I said I was ‘Jew-ish.’”",Q4
https://minnlawyer.com/2022/11/02/judge-keeps-n-d-abortion-ban-from-taking-effect/,Judge keeps N.D. abortion ban from taking effect,"Listen to this article Listen to this article

BISMARCK, N.D. — A North Dakota judge ruled Monday that he will keep the state’s ban on abortion from taking effect, saying there’s a “substantial probability” that a constitutional challenge to the law will succeed.

Judge Bruce Romanick’s ruling means abortion is still legal in North Dakota, though the state’s only clinic — the Red River Women’s Clinic of Fargo — shut down as it challenged the ban and has moved across the border to neighboring Minnesota.

Romanick last month rejected a request from North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley to let the law take effect while the Red River clinic’s lawsuit went forward. Romanick based his earlier decision on several factors, but Wrigley argued he had not sufficiently considered the clinic’s chances of prevailing in court. The North Dakota Supreme Court agreed and told Romanick to take another look.

In his earlier ruling, Romanick noted the clinic’s uphill battle. But in his ruling Monday, he said the clinic has a “substantial probability” of succeeding, though he noted that the question of whether abortion is a constitutional right in North Dakota has been contentious and has not been decided by the state’s highest court.

Romanick said the purpose of a preliminary injunction is to maintain the status quo until a case can be settled on the merits.

But he also wrote there is a “substantial probability” that the law is unconstitutional because of the constraint it places on doctors. Specifically, he took issue with the fact that the ban allows cases of rape or incest to be raised as an affirmative defense to administering an abortion — but notes that doctors could be prosecuted in the first place.

This puts unreasonable burdens on doctors and pregnant women that are “not reasonably related to the goal of preserving life” — which the state has said is the purpose of the law. He wrote that if “women do not have a reasonable avenue in which to get safe abortions when their lives are in danger, the Statute does not serve its intended purpose.”

Wrigley, a Republican, said he was still analyzing the ruling.

“I’m unpersuaded by almost everything I read in the judge’s ruling, and we look forward to responding,” he said.

Tammi Kromenaker, director of the Red River Women’s Clinic, said she was pleased that abortion remained “safe and legal” in the state.

“We want physicians who are treating patients to feel like they can use their best medical judgment and training and not be looking at the law books as to how they can take care of patients,” she said.

In the weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade earlier this year, the Red River clinic shut down its single location in Fargo and moved just a few miles across the state line to Moorhead, Minnesota, where abortion remains legal. But the clinic continued to press its lawsuit, arguing that the North Dakota constitution grants a right to abortion.

When Romanick blocked the law from taking effect last month, he acknowledged that the clinic had moved but noted doctors and hospitals would still be affected by the statute.

The law makes abortion illegal except in cases of rape or incest or when the life of the mother is in danger — any of which would have to be proven in court. Otherwise, a doctor who performs an abortion would face a felony charge, which abortion rights supporters say could stop doctors from performing abortions even if the mother’s health is at risk.

More than a dozen states had passed so-called trigger laws that were designed to outlaw most abortions if the high court threw out the constitutional right to end a pregnancy. While some states began enforcing the bans immediately other efforts to bar the procedure are tied up in the courts.

In Idaho, for example, a strict abortion ban is in effect, but a federal judge has temporarily barred the state from enforcing the ban in some medical situations while a lawsuit from the Department of Justice works through the courts. And last week Arizona’s attorney general has agreed not to enforce a near total ban on abortions at least until next year.

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/11/technology/elon-musk-twitter-takeover.html,Inside Elon Musk’s Takeover of Twitter,"SAN FRANCISCO — Elon Musk had a demand.

On Oct. 28, hours after completing his $44 billion buyout of Twitter the night before, Mr. Musk gathered several human-resource executives in a “war room” in the company’s offices in San Francisco. Prepare for widespread layoffs, he told them, six people with knowledge of the discussion said. Twitter’s work force needed to be slashed immediately, he said, and those who were cut would not receive bonuses that were set to be paid on Nov. 1.

The executives warned their new boss that his plan could violate employment laws and breach contracts with workers, leading to employee lawsuits, the people said. But Mr. Musk’s team said he was used to going to court and paying penalties, and was not worried about the risks. So Twitter’s human-resource, accounting and legal departments scrambled to figure out how to comply with his command.

Two days later, Mr. Musk learned exactly how costly those potential fines and lawsuits could be, three people said. Delays were also piling up as managers haggled over which employees to let go. He decided to wait on cutting jobs until after Nov. 1.

The order for immediate layoffs, the ensuing panic and the about-face reflect the chaos that has engulfed Twitter since Mr. Musk took over the company two weeks ago.

WEST VALLEY CITY — After being on the run for nearly seven years, a man charged with killing a woman in West Valley City and then dumping her body in Colorado was arrested earlier this year in Mexico City, West Valley police confirmed Monday.

Over the weekend, Francisco Jesus Huerta-Martinez, 41, was booked into the Salt Lake County Jail on a $1 million warrant that was issued for his arrest in 2015. He was charged in October 2015 in 3rd District Court with murder and aggravated robbery, first-degree felonies, and obstructing justice, a second-degree felony.

Police said Monday that Huerta-Martinez's arrest was the culmination of a ""yearslong, exhaustive effort"" by detectives that took them ""throughout Colorado and Texas"" and eventually into Mexico.

""This year, investigators developed new information regarding Huerta-Martinez's whereabouts, and in partnership with the U.S. Marshal Service and the Salt Lake County District Attorney's Office, Huerta-Martinez was located and taken into custody in Mexico City in May,"" said West Valley police spokeswoman Roxeanne Vainuku.

On Aug. 6, 2015, police say Maria Maricela Astorga-Chavez, 32, dropped off her son at her sister's residence and then got into an SUV driven by Huerta-Martinez. Astorga-Chavez was scheduled to pick her son up the next morning, but the last message the sister ever received from her was just after 1 a.m. on Aug. 7, 2015.

Two days later, on Aug. 9, 2015, Huerta-Martinez met a friend in Forth Worth, Texas, and claimed that he had ""strangled a person to death, wrapped the body in a blanket and dumped the body off the side of the road in the mountains of Colorado,"" according to charging documents.

Astorga-Chavez's body was found days later in Summit County, Colorado, wrapped in a comforter, according to police. An electrical cord was tied around the comforter. West Valley police also collected evidence from both the homes of Astorga-Chavez and Huerta-Martinez. Evidence of both of them being in Huerta-Martinez's room was also recovered, the charges state.

Vainuku said prior to this year, detectives had exhausted all leads as to Huerta-Martinez's whereabouts and the case went cold in 2019.

""It is our hope that the extradition back to Utah of Francisco Huerta-Martinez this past week will help bring to a close one painful chapter for the family of Maria Maricela Astorga-Chavez. We are grateful for our outstanding investigative team and their unceasing efforts to bring the suspect in this case to justice,"" she said.

As of Monday, a new court date for Huerta-Martinez had not been set.",Q4

(RNS) — The meeting of Ye, Nick Fuentes and Donald Trump was a win for an extreme, Catholic-leaning subset of Christian nationalism.

(RNS) — In the days after his recent dinner with former President Donald Trump, the rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, reflected on the experience in a video posted to Twitter. Speaking to an associate, Ye said his own exchanges with Trump were tense. But as they dined, he said, the former president was practically glowing about someone else at the table: Nick Fuentes, the white Christian nationalist whom Ye had brought with him to Mar-a-Lago.

“Trump is really impressed with Nick Fuentes,” Ye said in the video, which has since been deleted.





A few seconds later, Ye pivoted to a different topic: faith.

“Since we know, and all the Christians in America that love Trump know, that Trump is a conservative, we’re going to demand that you hold all policies directly to the Bible,” Ye said.

While the meeting at Trump’s club drew national outrage because of Fuentes’ antisemitic and white supremacist views, it was a win for an extreme subset of Christian nationalists who knit together virulent anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTQ sentiment, opposition to abortion and, in many cases, overt forms of antisemitism and white nationalism.

This cadre of media-savvy, mostly right-wing Catholics are exacting a growing allegiance from far-right political figures and groups. While some, including Fuentes, have attached themselves to seemingly quixotic causes such as Ye’s own nascent presidential bid, the dinner at Mar-a-Lago showcased how they have succeeded in gaining entree for their vision of American politics.

RELATED: How the Capitol attacks helped spread Christian nationalism in the extreme right

A key figure in the movement is Milo Yiannopoulos, a far-right agitator who reportedly helped set up the Trump meeting, and whom Ye referred to as a campaign staffer in a recent video. (Yiannopoulos clarified to Religion News Service in an email this week that “there is no campaign at present” in a legal sense.) Once associated with the right-wing website Breitbart, Yiannopoulos faded from prominence around 2017 after several scandals, one spurred by a video showing him singing karaoke as white supremacists in the audience cheered and gave Nazi salutes.

He has since recovered his standing as a connector of various far-right Catholic voices with right-wing politicians. His recent ascendance is partly thanks to Michael Voris, head of the hyperconservative Catholic outlet Church Militant. Decried by critics as racist and homophobic, the digital talk and news outlet, based in Michigan, originally used the word “Catholic” in its name until its local archdiocese publicly pressured it to stop doing so.





In an interview with RNS in April, Voris pointed to a Church Militant interview with Yiannopoulos in which Voris pressed him to explain how he reconciles his homosexuality with his Catholic faith. According to Voris, Yiannopoulos called him years later to thank him, describing his question as a “challenge” that set him on a new spiritual path that eventually resulted in his identifying as “ex-gay” and embracing a more conservative form of Catholicism.

Voris, who has built a reputation as an anti-LGBTQ crusader, also claims to have abandoned homosexuality. He revealed in 2016 that for most of his 30s he “lived a life of live-in relationships with homosexual men,” but has since reverted back to Catholicism and now “abhor(s) all these sins.”

Both men often tie the Catholic sexual abuse crisis to homosexuality. Yiannopoulos, even before abandoning his gay identity, spoke publicly about being a survivor of sexual abuse by a priest. (A 2011 John Jay College of Criminal Justice report concluded that claims that homosexuality fueled the sex abuse crisis are not borne out by statistical evidence.)

Yiannopoulos began regularly appearing on the Church Militant website and in 2021 emceed a protest the group staged outside a gathering of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in Baltimore. Voris said he has also served as Yiannopoulos’ occasional spiritual adviser.

“I just give him further instruction in the faith,” Voris told RNS in April. The two had another session slotted for later that month, he said, when Voris planned spend “three or four hours” at his house schooling Milo on Catholic sacramental theology.





Voris and Church Militant distanced themselves from Yiannopoulos on Monday, tweeting out a statement saying he “has never been an employee of Church Militant.” The statement acknowledged Yiannopoulos’ early work for the website but added ”since then (and unrelated to us) Milo has re-entered the world of political activism of which we have no comment.”

Yiannopoulos has also forged a relationship with Fuentes, who founded America First — an advocacy group and media enterprise — after dropping out of Boston University at age 18. Fuentes, now 24, traffics in memes celebrating Christian nationalism, often linking it to Catholicism.

During a livestream in June, Fuentes advocated for “Catholic Taliban rule in America,” explaining that such a regime would ban same-sex marriage and contraception. His followers, known as Groypers, were a consistent presence at anti-vaccine and anti-abortion rallies in 2021, often holding aloft crucifixes and chanting “Christ is king!”

People wearing America First-branded gear were also among those who stormed the U.S. Capitol and entered the U.S. Senate chamber, although there is no evidence Fuentes was part of the riot himself.

Aside from the Yiannopoulos connection, Church Militant has begun to echo Fuentes’ rhetoric. Earlier this year, Voris published a video in which he referred to young people who “style themselves as an America first approach,” arguing they should ultimately put “faith first” because doing so will allow “everything else” to fall into place. Another video directed at “young Catholics with an eye to political battle” railed against Protestantism, declaring that “’Christ is king’ must ring loud across the land, and that means Catholic truth must be embraced.”

RELATED: As Catholic bishops gather, so do protesters on right and left

Voris’ approach to Christian nationalism appears to differ from Fuentes’, however. In a recent interview, he argued that the U.S. shouldn’t be ruled by one Christian sect, but that laws should be rooted in “Christian principle … because what’s the alternative?”





Asked in April whether he was addressing his comments to members of America First, Voris demurred, insisting he was using the term “Christ is king” in the historic Christian sense and speaking generally to “young, orthodox Catholics who, on the political spectrum, would count themselves as patriotic.” He said any connection to groups such as America First was “informal,” later adding he didn’t want to “embrace any group.”

He also decried violence, calling it “repugnant to my Catholicism.”

Even so, America First leaders have been interviewed on Voris’ website, and Salon reported in May that Church Militant’s youth-focused movement was attempting to recruit from the ranks of America First supporters. Voris did not deny “linking arms” with groups such as America First for such purposes as staging protests outside Planned Parenthood clinics.

Yiannopoulos and Fuentes eventually brought into their orbit U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican whose outlandish statements have triggered fierce criticism from across the political spectrum. Greene, an ex-Catholic who was reportedly baptized in 2011 at the evangelical North Point Community Church, spoke in February at Fuentes’ America First conference. He introduced her by saying,“I want to say a very special thank you to Milo Yiannopoulos for making this happen.”

When Greene took the stage, she opened her remarks by citing her faith. “My name is Marjorie Taylor Greene, I am the daughter of the king, the one true living God, the Alpha and Omega, our Father in heaven. And I am a forgiven sinner, washed in the blood of our savior, Jesus Christ,” she told the crowd in Florida.

When people in the audience began chanting “Christ is king,” Greene replied: “Amen — Christ is king.”





Greene was quick to distance herself from Fuentes after the event, but in an hourlong Church Militant interview two months later she attacked U.S. Catholic bishops who lend aid to immigrants as an example of “Satan controlling the church.”

Asked about her remarks shortly afterward, Voris defended Greene to RNS, saying, “I don’t think the congresswoman went far enough, really.”

Yiannopoulos told RNS in an email this week that he helped broker the interview, and around the time it took place, he posted a video of himself on the social media site Telegram eating a Smucker’s Uncrustable Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich in what appeared to be the same house where the conversation was filmed.

Greene soon began identifying as a Christian nationalist. Yiannopoulos told RNS he identifies the same way, although he differentiated his views from those of Greene. “I’m somewhere closer to a Catholic Integralist than, say, Marjorie, who just wants a return to authentic 1776 America,” he said.

Yiannopoulos has since left a position as Greene’s intern to join with Ye. Fuentes now appears to be part of their team: In addition to traveling with Ye to Mar-a-Lago, Fuentes reportedly read aloud a message from Yiannopoulos over the weekend signaling he was joining the campaign.

“My last super chat ever because the next cash I send will be your paycheck,” Fuentes said, reading Yiannopoulos’ message. “And see you at the office on Monday, brother!”





RELATED: Who is Trump and Kanye’s dinner companion, Nick Fuentes?

Ye’s affiliation with Fuentes and Yiannopoulos appears linked to faith. In the days leading up to their dinner with Trump, Fuentes posted an image on Telegram depicting Ye and him shaking hands under the words “2 Most Banned in USA.” Between them is a cross, underneath which the line “Jesus is King” — also the title of a recent Ye album — is repeated five times.

Since the meeting, Fuentes has posted a video of Ye saying he continues to look for people who could be a better president than himself, but has yet to find anyone.

“Trump would be a great president but he’s gotta put God first in everything he does,” Ye says.

The same video also appeared on Yiannopoulos’ Telegram page. Two days earlier he posted a message celebrating the new campaign, saying, “it’s dawning on me tonight what a powerful and deadly alliance I have assembled—and how gloriously and effectively we can serve God.”

The precise dimensions of Ye’s religious beliefs are unclear, though he often invokes God and Jesus in public appearances and organized a series of gospel music “Sunday Services” in 2019. But more recently his thoughts on faith have taken on new dimensions: His antisemitic remarks that cost him licensing deals with Gap and Adidas appeared to echo the beliefs of a subset of Black Hebrew Israelites. In October, he tweeted a desire to go “death con 3” on Jewish people, adding, “I actually can’t be Anti Semitic because black people are actually Jew.”

On Thursday (Dec. 1), Ye invoked his faith repeatedly during an appearance with Fuentes on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’ show “Infowars.” With Fuentes frequently agreeing with Ye’s remarks and referring to a “Jewish mafia,” Ye insisted people need to “stop dissing Nazis all the time” and referred to Planned Parenthood as the “New World Order population control.” Fuentes, for his part, called for a “Christian party.”





Ye, wearing a mask the covered his entire head and calling himself a “baby Christian,” at one point apologized to Yiannopoulos, who was presumably offstage, for misquoting Scripture. Ye also read from a Bible that sat on the table in front of him throughout the interview.

Fuentes discussed their meeting with Trump at length, and Ye aimed to influence Jones’ listeners in their attitudes toward the former president. Among other things, he goaded Trump to put faith at the center of his new campaign.

“The worst thing that could come from this is that our leaders are held to Christian values, not Zionist values,” Ye said.

https://dailycaller.com/2022/12/20/sam-bankman-fried-extradition-us/,REPORT: Sam Bankman-Fried Agrees To Be Extradited To US,"Disgraced former crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried agreed to be extradited from the Bahamas to the U.S. to face charges of fraud and conspiracy, his lawyer reportedly said.

His local defense attorney Jerome Roberts was surprised to see him in court and was not informed of Bankman-Fried’s decision to be extradited due to a confusion with his U.S. legal team, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported. It was reported over the weekend that Bankman-Fried changed his mind about contesting extradition.

Sam Bankman-Fried, who faces fraud charges related to the collapse of his cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, agreed to be extradited to the U.S., one of his lawyers said, following a chaotic day in court in the Bahamas. https://t.co/qnz5JK8Qro pic.twitter.com/hQG7Pwemag — The New York Times (@nytimes) December 19, 2022

Roberts said he needed documents to review with Bankman-Fried before deciding to waive his objection to being extradited to the United States. A Bahamian judge granted Bankman-Fried and Roberts a request to converse with U.S. lawyers, who had contacted Bahamian prosecutors over the weekend about Bankman-Fried’s decision to be extradited.

Roberts later told reporters Bankman-Fried agreed to be extradited voluntarily, according to The New York Times. Roberts agreed to draft the necessary documents for extradition after the conversation with Bankman-Fried and his U.S. legal team, WSJ reported.

Bankman-Fried was sent back to Fox Hill Prison after the court proceedings, a facility known for being “harsh due to overcrowding, poor nutrition, inadequate sanitation, poor ventilation, and inadequate medical care,” according to a 2020 State Department report. (RELATED: Fox Business Contributor Claims Liz Warren’s Crypto Bill Is A ‘Bullet To Financial Privacy’)

He was indicted by Dec 13. by federal prosecutors from the U.S. Southern District of New York on eight counts of fraud and conspiracy. Charges include wire fraud, securities fraud, money laundering and campaign finance violations, according to the indictment.

Bankman-Fried “agreed with others to defraud customers of FTX.com by misappropriating those customers’ deposits and using those deposits to pay expenses and debts of Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried’s proprietary crypto hedge fund, and to make investments,” the indictment says.

Bankman-Fried’s net worth peaked at an estimated $26.5 billion and was estimated at $17.2 billion in September 2022, Forbes Magazine measured. He had $100,000 left in his bank account the last time he checked.

City continues trial and error approach,"In 2021, Charleston officials vowed to do better after a 100-person brawl broke out on King Street. In response, City Council passed a flurry of safety-focused policies for the city's popular nightlife hub.

Then, the summer of 2022 was bookended by a Memorial Day shooting near King that left nine people wounded and a Labor Day shooting on the street that injured six.

City Council spent the last few months of 2022 drafting new policies aimed at preventing the alcohol-fueled violence that had cast a shadow over the bar district. They include:

A permanent change to traffic flow and parking on the street.

Changes to the requirements needed for a business to sell alcohol after midnight.

A pilot program to give out free subscriptions to a mobile ID scanning app for bar owners.

Some of the policies take effect in the new year. Still, public safety experts say there is no guarantee they will serve their purpose. While some strategies pursued by the city are well-documented in academic research, others have little evidence to back them up. As a result, the city could be in a trial-and-error process for years.

""We just don’t have a good scientific baseline,"" said Ian Adams, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina, referring to crime reporting data in the United States. ""That shouldn't stop policymakers from making a decision. They don't have the benefit of being able to stand still.""

Robert Mitchell, who has served on City Council for 25 years, remembers feeling uneasy when Upper King Street began to take off as a bar-hopping destination years ago.

""It just felt like we didn't know what we were doing,"" he said.

Although nightlife has been progressing north on King for decades, bar-owners noticed a surge in popularity when Gov. Henry McMaster led an early reopening of businesses in South Carolina during the pandemic when compared with other areas of the country, especially the Northeast.

LSU Manship School News Service

Third in a four-part series.

At 12:35 p.m. on Nov. 17, 1972, the phone rang in the office of acting FBI Director L. Patrick Gray in Washington.

It was Deputy Attorney General Ralph Erickson, calling to order an investigation into the shooting of the two students at Southern University amid a cloud of tear gas 25 hours before.

FBI officials quickly made plans to send dozens of agents from across the country, including some who had investigated shootings at Kent State and Jackson State. The first group arrived in Baton Rouge two days later, setting up in the Capitol House Hotel, a white-painted, square brick building downtown.

“It took us just overnight to set up the office,” said Jack Stoddard, an agent from Philadelphia. On Monday morning, Nov. 20, he said, “assignments were given out.”

PART 1:For two families, a Southern University education meant everything. Then came tragedy.

Within three days, the FBI knew that the students, Denver Smith and Leonard Brown, had been killed by a single blast of buckshot – and that the shot had likely been fired by one of the East Baton Rouge Parish sheriff’s deputies near a palm tree in front of the school’s administration building.

Medical examiners removed 17 tiny shotgun pellets from the men’s bodies. Three more pellets had dented the wall of the building right behind where the men were hit as they ran from the tear gas.

That accounted for 20 of the 27 pellets streaming from one buckshot shell, and FBI test firings provided a range of possible shooting angles that all led to a cluster of deputies in front of or to one side of the tree. The deputies were there to disperse at least 200 students who had gathered after the arrests of campus protest leaders.

FBI agents collected more than 1,000 feet of film from TV news stations and nearly 70 photos from the State Police. They began analyzing them frame by frame, watching as Smith and Brown fell and noting where deputies were in the moments before and after the shooting.

Nearly 2,700 pages of FBI files obtained by the LSU Cold Case Project indicate that as more agents poured into town, they fanned out in pairs over three weeks to conduct 750 interviews and re-interviews, including several hundred with Southern students and officials, 47 with State Police officers and 91with sheriff’s deputies.

Two dozen deputies had carried shotguns, the files say, but only nine were near the palm tree. As the FBI intensified its focus on those nine, it reenacted the shooting, with two agents standing where Smith and Brown last stood and others placed where deputies appeared in photos and films.

A land-surveying firm plotted the distance – 40 to 50 feet – between the students and deputies. It also marked some deputies’ locations within a triangle from which ballistics experts believed the shot had come.

But there were still big problems: All of the deputies denied firing the fatal shot or knowing who did. No image showed the exact moment it was fired. And no witness could definitively identify the shooter.

A couple of tips had come from Southern students, and the few Black deputies shared the chatter they were hearing. But nothing had checked out so far.

Few of the several hundred people there that day saw clearly what had happened. Tear gas filled the air. Many students were either fleeing or hunkering down in the building. And the event itself happened so quickly.

Even some deputies, who were wearing helmets with visors, had trouble identifying themselves in the photos. And two commissions that were investigating the shooting – one created by the governor, the other by civil rights leaders – also had come up with no clear leads.

So the FBI turned to an investigative tool that remains controversial today, asking each of the nine deputies who had held shotguns near the tree to take polygraphs or lie-detector tests.

The tests measure a person’s physiological response in answering questions, and they are not always reliable or allowed as evidence in court. A guilty person who stays calm may pass the test. Someone who is innocent but nervous might fail.

“It was just a tool,” said Ed Walker, an FBI agent from New York who was sent to investigate the Southern shooting. “But if somebody flunked a polygraph badly – and the examiner is experienced and tells you – you can be pretty sure the guy is lying.”

There was another option: Compel the deputies to testify before a grand jury. Ossie Brown, who had just been elected district attorney for East Baton Rouge Parish, had promised to bring the case before a state grand jury.

And if Brown did not get anywhere, federal prosecutors were willing to empanel their own grand jury, Stanley Pottinger, then the assistant U.S. attorney general for civil rights recalled in a recent interview.

Such a move, he said, would “be a last ditch in a sense, the last string on the bow.”

PART 2:50 years ago, 2 Southern University students were shot and killed. A sister wondered, 'Why? Why?'

Stress and a mental breakdown

By mid-December 1972, four of the nine deputies had passed polygraphs, saying they did not fire the fatal shot or know who did. Five others refused to take tests, and memos by FBI agents and Justice Department lawyers provide an inside look at the efforts to analyze their actions and persuade them to talk.

Gary Bruce Wall, a deputy and jailor, who stood 6 feet, 5 inches and weighed 250 pounds, was the first of the five to become the focus of investigators – and he had himself to blame, the memos show.

In his first FBI interview, Wall said he was on one side of the palm tree when a tear gas canister landed near him. He tried to scoop it up, but it exploded, he said, knocking him to his knees. He said he retreated, taking cover behind Big Bertha, the bright blue armored vehicle parked in the street, and never fired his shotgun.

Agents easily spotted Wall in the photos and film: He had a shotgun with a special attachment for skeet shooting. They also could see that he had never made any of the movements he described.

An FBI agent confronted Wall, saying that if he was wrong about reaching for the canister and taking cover, maybe he had fired his weapon without realizing it, too.

Wall also may have faced another issue. Mike Barnett, another deputy, said in a recent interview that he told the FBI he had heard a shotgun blast that was louder than the tear gas ones coming from behind him around the time of the fatal shot.

Barnett did not see the shooter. But when the FBI showed him film, he said he pointed to a prison guard who seemed to be firing a shotgun with a special attachment, though he did not know the deputy’s name.

When agents asked Wall to take a polygraph, he stalled and hired a lawyer who accused them of “zeroing in” on his client.

Meanwhile, Lt. Robert “Bobby” Carr, another deputy who declined to take a polygraph, also placed himself in investigators’ sights, FBI files show.

Carr had been with the sheriff’s office for nearly a decade and had led a squad of deputies near the palm tree.

In his first interviews, Carr told the FBI that he had fired two tear gas shells toward the students. He also acknowledged that after the first canister exploded, he ordered his men to “lock and load,” even though only higher officials were supposed to issue such an order.

What agents did not know was he had been telling top sheriff’s officials since early December that he might have fired a third shot. His worry festered and, on Dec. 19, Carr told his bosses that he needed to change his story.

The next day, Sheriff Al Amiss and two other top officials met with Carr at his home. According to the FBI files, Carr told them he now believed he had fired three shots at Southern and that the third might have been buckshot.

Amiss immediately told federal officials about Carr’s “pangs of remorse,” the memos show. Carr hired a lawyer, who gave the FBI a written statement on Dec. 22 saying Carr probably fired three shots but that all three were tear gas.

And as agents continued to review the images, they concluded that neither Wall nor Carr, if firing from where they had stood, could likely have hit the students.

Over the next few months, both Wall and Carr left the department. Wall moved to Texas and died in 2003.

His widow, Pamela Wall, said he did not talk much about what happened at Southern, but it “bothered him a lot, it did. He just always felt it wasn’t right.”

In recent interviews, Carr said he had a mental breakdown after the shooting and was hospitalized. Investigators thought he blamed himself for the students’ deaths, but Carr said the stress of helping the agents pushed him over the edge.

“It was just a combination of everything that was taking place,” Carr said. “It was the hours we put in, trying to think over all of what took place, and trying to figure out who was there.”

Saying no to polygraphs

Three others who declined to take polygraphs were among the deputies in the area from which the shot came, according to several FBI and Justice Department memos.

All three – Melvin Story, Paul Potts and Wayne Cambre – gave the FBI accounts of their actions. But each responded differently in declining the polygraphs.

Story, a Navy veteran who had fought at Iwo Jima and Okinawa, said tear gas had entered his mask and that he did not remember who was standing next to him and never fired his shotgun. He politely declined the polygraph, one memo said, “with little or no comment.”

Potts, a former Army Ranger and a member of the sheriff’s new tactical team, told agents he put on his mask when he saw tear gas and did not retreat. He said he held his shotgun, barrel pointing up, and never fired.

Potts said he knew he would pass a polygraph but did not want to help narrow the field of suspects out of loyalty to the group. A fellow deputy probably “made a mistake,” he said, and if that deputy was convicted, “the whole group should be convicted.”

Cambre, a Vietnam combat veteran, told the FBI he had removed the live ammunition from his shotgun before going to campus. During the encounter, he said, he dropped to his hands and knees to avoid getting hit by something students had thrown and then got up on one knee. According to an FBI memo, he said he then fired a tear gas shell into bushes behind the crowd of students.

Cambre also told the FBI he saw Smith and Brown fall but did not realize they had been shot. After retreating from the gas, he said, he fired a second tear gas shell to disperse students gathering behind the deputies.

But when agents asked him on Dec. 12, 1972, if he would take a polygraph, Cambre became “extremely angry, hostile, and obstinate,” according to FBI memos.

Referring to his work as a deputy on other cases, Cambre said: “If I can get up on the stand and testify in court that results in a conviction, I certainly can tell anyone that I did not shoot the two students, and this should be enough.”

He also said the FBI “has now stopped investigating and started harassing,” the memos said.

Both Story and Potts have died. Cambre reiterated in a recent interview that he did not shoot the students and acknowledged that he was angry at the agents.

“I have no respect for the Yankee FBI agents,” he said.

He added that earlier in 1972, a fellow deputy who was a close friend had been killed in a shootout with Black Muslims. He said he asked the FBI agents why they were not as aggressive in investigating that shooting.

“They laughed at me,” he said.

Still just ‘educated guesswork’

By early 1973, the FBI had gathered as much evidence as it could. But it was circumstantial.

Jeffrey R. Whieldon, a prosecutor in the Justice Department’s criminal division in Washington, noted there was “no specific information” that identified the shooter. Even with the “careful analysis” of the images and the likely angle of the shot, he wrote, the names and locations of some of the nine deputies who had shotguns near the tree remained “merely a matter of educated guesswork.”

He also saw other hurdles to building a case: What if the deputy who fired the shot had made a mistake – forgetting whether live or tear gas shells were in his gun – and had no intent to shoot the students?

And what if he did not realize amid the chaos that he had fired the shot? In that case, Whieldon wrote, he also might be able to pass a polygraph saying he did not.

With Justice Department approval, the FBI shared its files with Ossie Brown, the district attorney in Baton Rouge, who was about to start calling deputies before a state grand jury.

If new evidence emerged, the state could seek the most appropriate charge, from murder or negligent homicide on down to assault with a deadly weapon. The federal government could only charge violations of the victims’ civil rights.

The state grand jury convened that March and met almost daily for four months to consider the Southern shooting and other cases. Brown’s team brought in 67 witnesses, including forensics experts, deputies and state troopers.

“They said they narrowed it down to a line of deputies,” one of the grand jurors, Billy Badeaux, recalled. “When they brought them up to testify, they said these are the six guys that were in that line where we think the shots came from.”

Fifty years later, he remembers feeling that some of the deputies were covering for each other. “One of them knew what the other was gonna say, and they all said the same thing,” Badeaux said.

The state grand jury wrapped up on July 28, 1973, without identifying the shooter.

A dramatic final witness

At that point, the FBI was ready to close the case. But Whieldon, the criminal prosecutor, argued in September 1972 that given the public importance of the case, the Justice Department had a moral obligation to convene a federal grand jury

“Its sole purpose would be to see if someone will ‘crack,’” Whieldon wrote.

Pottinger, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, agreed and told the FBI to check if Story, Potts and Cambre would take polygraphs. All three declined again. So Justice officials began planning how, as one memo put it, to get the “secret few” deputies to talk.

Steve Mayo, then a young assistant U.S. attorney in Baton Rouge, recalled how he and Whieldon pushed together tables in the office library in the spring of 1974, laying out blown-up photos showing the line of deputies.

“He and I were trying to figure out together which gun fired the deadly shot,” Mayo said.

And in a memo on May 8, prosecutors said they were willing to offer immunity from prosecution to any of eight deputies who could provide information that would “significantly aid” the grand jury.

The grand jury met in Baton Rouge from May 20 to May 28. Jurors heard from 35 witnesses, including Story, Potts and Cambre.

All three were sworn in, and each of them denied firing the fatal shot or knowing who did, Justice memos say. But for the first time, each of the three also said he would consider taking a polygraph, the memos say.

Cambre said in the recent interview that he remembers prosecutors trying to pit the deputies against each other.

“They treated us like crap,” Cambre, now 75, said. “They accused us, pointed fingers, saying, ‘This deputy said that about you, and that deputy said this about you, and you said this about that deputy.’ And I just told them ‘I don’t give a damn what somebody else said.’”

Asked how he thought the shooting could have happened, Cambre said in the interview that he did not know but that he presumed it was “probably an accident.”

About three weeks after the grand jury met, Story and Cambre again declined to take lie-detector tests. But Potts – who had repeatedly refused out of loyalty to fellow deputies – agreed to go ahead.

According to FBI memos, Potts said during the exam that he had looked to his right through the tear gas at Southern and saw a deputy on one knee firing some type of shot toward the students in front of the administration building.

Potts named the deputy, but the name is blacked out in the files released publicly. Potts’ description resembled Cambre’s account that he was on one knee when he fired his first tear gas shot into bushes by the building.

If Potts was referring to Cambre, he also supported Cambre’s account that he only had tear gas shells in his shotgun.

Potts described an exchange between himself and the other deputy as they retreated to the street behind the palm tree.

“What are you shooting?” Potts said he asked.

“Tear gas,” the other deputy said.

Potts said he watched as the deputy ejected two unused shells from his gun, and they both appeared to be tear gas.

When the polygraph examiner asked Potts if he had fired buckshot, he answered “no.” The examiner then named a number of other deputies – one by one – and asked if, to Potts’ knowledge, each had fired the fatal shot. Potts’ response to each name: “No.”

Potts passed the test, and with that, the investigation was effectively over.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11525457/Just-one-person-Twitter-stood-say-Trump-NOT-banned.html,Just one person at Twitter stood up to say Trump should NOT be banned,"Only one Twitter employee said Donald Trump should not be banned and warned then-CEO Jack Dorsey, who was on vacation in French Polynesia, that he was 'gatekeeping speech for the entire world.'

The latest Twitter leaks from journalist Michael Shellenberger revealed what went on at the social media company in the aftermath of the deadly January 6 Capitol riot that resulted in booting former President Trump from the platform.

As Twitter made its decision, the files showed that a single, junior worker voiced their opposition, warning Dorsey and their coworkers about the free speech implications.

'This might be an unpopular opinion but one off ad hoc decisions like this that don't appear rooted in policy are imho a slippery slope and reflect an alternatively equally dictatorial problem,' the employee said about banning Trump.

'This now appears to be a fiat by an online platform CEO with a global presence that can gatekeep speech for the entire world - which seems unsustainable.'

The employee specified that their concerns were fueled by Trump's suspension from Facebook, saying that booting the president from the most popular social media sites was dangerous.

'That's the space that fills with the idea (conspiracy theory?) that all social media heads and internet moguls at every layer sit around like kings casually deciding what people can and cannot see, and it's unhelpful to the internet ecosystem as a whole.'

The latest Twitter files released on Saturday night revealed that a sole junior employee spoke out against banning Donald Trump from the platform, warning then-CEO Jack Dorsey that it makes it seem like he and other tech CEOs are gatekeeping free speech

Shellenberger also tweeted screengrabs of messages between Twitter executives, with one appearing eager to ban Trump as they discussed stricter policy changes with former safety chief Yoel Roth.

The person, whose name was redacted, specifically asked Roth if a new change regarding penalties over 'incitement of violence' would 'affect our approach to Trump.'

Although Roth said it didn't, the former president was canned the following day, on January 8, specifically over 'risk of further incitement of violence.'

The newest batch of Twitter documents - now known as the 'Twitter files' - comes after yesterday's leaks where it was revealed that FBI agents pressured the social media company to censor conservative commentators who pushed unfounded claims that the 2020 election was stolen.

In the direct aftermath of the deadly January 6 Capitol Riot, Jack Dorsey (left) was on vacation in French Polynesia and delegated much of the decision making to Yoel Roth, then-head of safety and trust, who navigated the process to ban Trump

After two days of chaos at Twitter, with several employees appearing eager to boot the former president, Trump finally saw his account suspended on January 8

In the latest Twitter files, Shellenberger noted that Twitter had long-resisted calls to ban Trump, explaining in 2018 that banning a world leader would be problematic.

However, everything changed following the January 6 Capitol riot, which resulted in the death of five people as rioters stormed the Congressional building.

The former president was accused of inciting the riot, and many called on Twitter to permanently ban him.

Shellenberger said files showed that Doresy was on vacation at the time and delegated much of the work to Roth, Twitter's head of trust and safety, and Vijaya Gadde, head of legal, policy and trust.

While Dorsey appeared to be hands-off on the issue, he did email employees telling them to 'remain consistent in its policies.'

Roth and other employees, however, don't appear satisfied, according to their messages on January 7, with the former safety head saying employees are not happy about the company's lack of action against Trump.

'A few engineers have reached out to me directly about it, and I'm chatting with them, but it's so clear they just want to know that someone is doing something about this, and it's not that we're ignoring the issues here,' Roth wrote.

The employee on the other end, whose name is redacted, replied: 'I think there's also an opportunity to help people understand that, while it seems obvious and simple that we 'should' permaban his personal account, we can't afford to take that immediate action without first 'playing the movie out' and anticipating all the other things that can happen, and then figure out the plans for those possible scenarios.'

While executives appeared to be mulling their options, Roth messaged a coworker the following day, revealing that Dorsey 'just approved repeat offender for civic integrity.'

The rule would create a system where five violations would result in permanent suspension.

'Progress,' the employee replied in excitement. 'Does this affect our approach to Trump, who I think that we publicly said had one remaining strike? Or does the incitement to violence aspect change that calculus?'

Roth, however, said that Trump 'continues to have his one strike,' which would have kept his account safe.

But the account was still banned due to that very 'risk of further incitement of violence.'

Messages between Roth and employees showed that they were dissatisfied with Dorsey's initial approach on Trump. Employees wanted to take initiative to ban his account, but Roth and an unnamed staffer noted that it was important to wait and see how things play out first

The following day, Roth appears excited when telling a staffer that a change has now been enacted to ban an account after five strikes

The employee immediately asks if it means Trump would get the boot, but Roth notes that the former president only has a single strike against him at the time

As the decision to ban Trump approached, chaos was engulfing the social media company after the former president was banned from Facebook and Instagram.

According to messages between a sales executive and Roth, Dorsey had sent around an email saying that Twitter 'will permanently suspend [Trump] if our policies are violated after a 12 hour account lock.'

When the executive asks Roth if violations other than election fraud claims count for Trump, specifically tweets 'inciting violence,' the former saftey chief safety that the ban would be placed for 'any policy violation.'

Then when the sales person asks if Twitter would sidestep its long-standing rule to provide 'public-interest exceptions' for world leaders in order to ban Trump.

'In this specific case, we're changing our public interest approach for his account to say any violation would result in suspension,' Roth replied.

A Twitter engineer also messaged Roth about the debate to ban Trump, suggesting it wasn't right for the company to give the former president special treatment just because of his position.

Roth responded: 'I think you're spot on. 'To put a different spin on it: policy is one part of the system of how Twitter works.

'...We ran into the world changing faster than we were able to either adapt the product or the policy.'

A sales executive goes on to message Roth about mounting pressure Twitter is receiving to ban Trump following the suspensions from Facebook and Instagram. It mentions that Dorsey called for a permanent suspension on Trump if he violates policies

The sales executive questions if Twitter would be foregoing its long-time exception for important public figures, and Roth confirms that they are in this case

Along with justifying its decision to ban Trump, Roth also appeared to push for the permanent suspension of US Rep. Matt Gaetz in order to build an argument for booting the former president.

Gaetz had seen his Twitter account restricted last year violating policies against glorifying violence when he called on Antifa members to be hunted down, and during the uproar to ban Trump, an employee messaged Roth about calls to ban Gaetz.

Roth said that people were working on that, but that 'it doesn't quite fit anywhere.'

The Twitter files also revealed that the company inadvertently affected unrelated tweets when trying to suppress posts from the far-right conspiracy theory group, QAnon.

Twitter at the time was working to suppress tweets making the unfounded claims that the 2020 election was rigged, targeting phrases like 'Stop the Steal' and 'Kraken.'

The latter of which referred to Trump-aligned attorney Sidney Powell's vow to 'release the Kraken' when reiterating voter fraud claims, a term popularized by QAnon.

Roth and an employee acknowledge that an error was made blacklisting 'kraken,' as both the mythical sea monster and a cryptocurrency exchange share the name.

Along with the ban for Trump, Twitter appeared to be ready to ban US US Rep. Matt Gaetz, who had his account restricted for glorifying violence on the platform

The Twitter files also revealed that the company inadvertently affected unrelated tweets when trying to suppress posts from the far-right conspiracy theory group, QAnon

The newest Twitter files build on the previous batch, where it was revealed that federal authorities nudged Roth to suppress the First Amendment rights of conservative commentators who pushed the idea of fraud during the 2020 presidential election.

The leaks from journalist Matt Taibbi also show the tech giant's staffers openly discussed banning former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee over a joke.

Taibbi tweeted a screengrab of a message between Twitter executives following a report from the FBI highlighting tweets from former Tippecanoe County, Indiana, official and Republican, John Basham.

Basham alleged between two and 25 percent of ballots by mail were being rejected due to 'errors.'

He later tweeted: 'An unexpected number of registered Republicans are returning ballots,' while alleging the vote by mail had been a Democratic Party plan to gain an advantage in the election.

Former Tippecanoe County, Indiana, official and Republican, John Basham's tweets alleging election fraud were flagged by Twitter staff

Rather than remove the tweet, Roth opts to place a 'Learn how voting is safe and secure' label on the message.

Roth, who quit his role at Twitter last month following Musk's takeover, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com on Saturday.

Basham responded to the leak on Twitter saying: 'The Twitter files show that the FBI violated my First Amendment right by getting Twitter to take action against my tweets!

'The federal government has no right to determine what I may print or what I may say.'

Musk defended the FBI in a tweet that read: 'With rare exception, the FBI seems to want to do the right thing.'

He did concede that under Twitter's former leaders the company 'operated as s Democratic Party activist machine.'

One exchange (left) shows Roth explaining he will miss 'the FBI and DHS meetings.' Roth is also seen joking (right) about a mysterious meeting on his calendar, saying it is 'DEFINITELY not a meeting with the FBI I SWEAR'

Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee's joke about his dead grandparents voting in 2020 was also flagged by Twitter staff

In another case, when former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee joked: 'Stood in the rain for hour to early vote today. When I got home I filled my stack of mail-in-ballots and then voted the ballots of my deceased parents and grandparents. They vote just like me! #Trump2020.'

On Slack, one Twitter staffer said: 'Putting this tweet on everyone's radar. This appears to be a joke but other people might believe it. Can I get your weigh in this?'

Roth says in the conversation: 'It's a joke' but also says that Huckabee is 'literally admitting in a tweet to a crime.'

He went on: 'Yeah. I could see us taking action under 'misleading claims that cause confusion about the established laws, regulations, procedures, and methods of a civic process' but it's not one that we could really label in a useful way, so it's removal (of a stupid and ill-advised joke) or nothing.'

Roth added: 'I'm maybe inclined not to remove without a report from voting authorities given it's been a while since he tweeted it and virtually all of the replies I'm seeing are critical/counterspeech.'

The documents released Friday primarily related to the months prior to the January 8, 2021 decision to ban Donald Trump from Twitter. Trump is seen on January 6 prior to the Capitol riot

Staffers at Twitter argued that 'historical context' and 'current climate' should factor into the decision to suspend Trump's account ahead of his January 8, 2021 ban

The previous Twitter thread also covered the months and weeks leading up to then-President Donald Trump's ban from Twitter following the Capitol riot, shedding light on the increasingly frenzied internal efforts within the social media site to moderate his baseless claims of election fraud.

Some of the most intriguing documents relate to the apparent cozy relationship between top Twitter executives and the FBI, though Taibbi did not reveal any direct evidence of the agency's intervention in the decision to ban Trump.

In an undated chat on the messaging app Slack that Taibbi says took place after the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot, Roth is seen joking about a mysterious meeting on his calendar, saying it is 'DEFINITELY not a meeting with the FBI I SWEAR'.

A separate message mentions 'a report from the FBI concerning 2 tweets,' which appeared to relate to claims about ballot fraud in the November 2020 election.

The message notes that one of the tweets, claiming mail-in ballots were being 'shredded', was adjudicated false, but that the second one claiming up to 25 percent of mail-in ballots were being 'rejected for errors' was found to be within Twitter policy.",Q4

https://lawandcrime.com/crime/delphi-suspect-faces-murder-charge-with-underlying-offenses-and-remains-held-on-20-million-bond-new-court-records-indicate/,"Delphi Suspect Richard Allen Faces Murder Charges with Underlying Offenses, New Court Records Indicate","Delphi Murders suspect Richard Matthew Allen, 50, stands accused of murder under a specific subsection of Indiana’s statute which involves at least one underlying offense, a court docket in the case made public for the first time on Wednesday indicates.

Most, if not all, of the actual documents in the file remain sealed, but a series of entries on an online Indiana court docket sketch the outlines of the closely watched criminal matter. Law&Crime has cross-referenced the terse and unilluminating docket entries to shed some light on the case.

The entries do not currently list a defense attorney for Allen, but they do say he’s being held on the aforementioned $20 million bond in “cash or corporate surety.” It had previously been reported that Allen was being held without bond.

Citing the local prosecutor’s office and the local sheriff’s department, Indianapolis FOX affiliate WXIN reported Wednesday evening that the bond entry was some kind of error, but the prosecutor’s office never returned Law&Crime calls to confirm the dollar amount listed on the docket when we inquired about it earlier Wednesday afternoon. Nor was Law&Crime able to reach the Carroll County Clerk of Court’s office; it is closed as a matter of usual business on Wednesday afternoons. The Clerk of Court’s office previously told Law&Crime on Tuesday that it considered the online docket to be the best source of information about the matter going forward.

A smattering of other entries in the case docket are dated Friday, Oct. 28, 2022, when news leaked out that Allen had been arrested. It is on that date that the prosecution formally was opened and a “verified request to prohibit public access” to the records was filed. An immediate order issued by Carroll County Circuit Judge Benjamin A. Diener sealed various records in the case.

The information and a probable cause affidavit — both of which Carroll County Prosecutor Nicholas C. McLeland said on Monday would remain sealed — were also filed on Oct. 28.

McLeland and the state police announced on Monday that the charges are in connection with the deaths of Liberty “Libby” German, 14, and her best friend Abigail “Abby” Williams, 13. The young teens vanished while walking the Monon High Bridge Trail near Delphi, Indiana, on Feb. 13, 2017. The trail traverses an abandoned stretch of the old Monon Railroad and crosses a tall trestle.

The court docket indicates, as McLeland previously announced, that Allen is charged with two counts of murder. Until now, we didn’t know precisely which subsection of Indiana’s murder charge was at play. The docket says Allen is charged with murder under Ind. Code § 35-42-1-1(2), which is a murder involving a specific underlying criminal offense.

Basic Murder Law in Indiana

By way of comparison, let’s start with Ind. Code § 35-42-1-1(1), the Hoosier State’s basic murder statute. It defines and criminalizes murder as having occurred when a person “knowingly or intentionally kills another human being.” Those words are brief, but the reality is more complex — perhaps explaining why prosecutors did not choose this particular option in Allen’s case.

To secure a conviction on the basic charge, according to Indiana’s model jury instructions, the state must prove four elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the defendant (2) killed (3) each specific victim in a (4) knowing and intentional matter.

That might sound simple, but at times, it is not.

Proving the fourth element can sometimes be vexing. A review of a few Indiana criminal appeals suggests that convicted defendants do litigate the issue of whether prosecutors proved their crimes were “knowingly or intentionally” committed — especially in cases which involve an accomplice or a theory of accomplice liability.

Plus, in Indiana, voluntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense to murder, and the model jury instructions suggest that it can operate as somewhat of a default when coupled to a murder charge. Voluntary manslaughter involves a killing committed in “sudden heat.” The jury instructions say the state has to prove a lack of “sudden heat” to convict an individual of murder. If the state fails to prove that sudden heat did not exist, manslaughter is proven, and the jury default to that count, the model jury instructions indicate.

Murder During Another Crime

That background is important as we look toward the charge the docket says Allen actually is facing. It’s verbose, but in some ways it is less complex.

The specific charge being alleged against Allen applies when a defendant:

(2) kills another human being while committing or attempting to commit arson, burglary, child molesting, consumer product tampering, criminal deviate conduct (under IC 35-42-4-2 before its repeal [this involves deviate sexual conduct]), kidnapping, rape, robbery, human trafficking, promotion of human labor trafficking, promotion of human sexual trafficking, promotion of child sexual trafficking, promotion of sexual trafficking of a younger child, child sexual trafficking, or carjacking (before its repeal)[.]

It is unclear from the docket precisely which underlying offense or offenses is alleged in the Delphi case — but the list of possibilities contained within the statute is harrowing.

It is possible that kidnapping is alleged because the authorities long ago publicized a brief video clip recorded by Libby German of someone saying “guys, down the hill.” Most of the clip has never been made public, nor have many other details about the grim case. But, again, the docket is silent as to the specifics.

Regardless of which underlying offense is at play, the murder charges — as they are currently listed under Ind. Code § 35-42-1-1(2) — will require prosecutors to prove as follows: (1) that the named defendant (2) killed (3) each specific victim (4) while “committing or attempting to commit” the underlying offense.

And that might be easier, depending on the facts of the case. It appears from the statutes themselves and from the model jury instructions that prosecutors will not have to dance around proving a lack of “sudden heat” (should the lesser-included offense come into the equation). Nor will prosecutors have to negotiate the minefield of proving that the deaths themselves were knowing or intentional.

Generally speaking, statues such as the one cited in Allen’s docket require prosecutors only to prove that deaths occurred during the commission of an underlying offense — even unintentionally. Again, depending on the facts of the case, that burden can oftentimes be easier for the state to carry.

The decision of which charge to apply to a case is strategic, and here, prosecutors aren’t saying much. Beyond announcing the charges and indicating that the case file itself remains sealed, they’ve remained tight lipped. McLeland’s office has refused to return Law&Crime’s phone calls even to confirm whether the bail amount is indeed accurate.

Additional Details

According to the newly revealed docket, initial hearing for Allen was held on Friday, Oct. 28, at 10:30 a.m.

The docket also reveals — for the first time — when Judge Diener will hold a hearing to ascertain whether any of the currently sealed records in the case will be made public. That hearing is slated for Nov. 22, 2022, at 9:00 a.m., the docket says.

As prosecutors previously announced, a pretrial conference is scheduled for Jan. 13, 2023, at 9 a.m.

A jury trial in the matter is currently scheduled to last five days. It’s scheduled to begin on March 20, 2023, and to conclude on March 24, 2023. It’s rare that a trial date scheduled this early in a proceeding would, indeed, occur on time, but it does happen from time to time. Much will depend on whether Allen waives his right to a speedy trial or enforces that constitutional right.

Under Indiana Criminal Procedure Rule 4, defendants can file a motion for an “early trial.” If such a motion is filed, trial must be held within 70 days of the date of the request. That same rule also contemplates that a criminal trial be held within six months of an arrest — though defendants can request delays, usually so their attorneys can examine evidence and mount a defense.

Law&Crime was unable to secure additional information about the case because the clerk of court’s office was closed for the aforementioned reason.

https://apnews.com/1b0c7575627136cb1fb6d672465081eb,Chief justice in Ohio map flap: Court attacks harm democracy,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ohio Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor isn’t rattled on a personal level by the political attacks she endured from fellow Republicans during Ohio’s protracted redistricting fight. She’s confident she “did the right thing” in ruling their proposed political maps unconstitutional.

What does concern the retiring jurist is the ignorance and lack of respect for foundational government principles that she believes their actions demonstrated.

O’Connor drew GOP wrath for joining three Democrats on the seven-member Ohio Supreme Court to repeatedly invalidate the state’s new, Republican-drawn legislative and congressional maps. The maps remain in limbo as O’Connor exits the court Dec. 31 because of age limits.

“The people that voiced a need to remove me from office through impeachment really don’t have a grasp on our Constitution, or democracy, or checks and balances,” O’Connor, 71, told The Associated Press in a year-end interview last week. “And, unfortunately, they are in the Legislature.”

O’Connor — a former common pleas judge, county prosecutor, lieutenant governor and public safety director — said that she received overwhelming support from the public while the court fight raged, so “it certainly didn’t take courage for me to withstand the slings and arrows of the Legislature.”

“My advice to them was, please review the Constitution and maybe go back to, what is it, fourth or fifth grade, and learn about our institutions,” she said. “And maybe, just maybe, review what it was like in Germany when Hitler intimidated the judiciary and passed those laws that allowed for the treatment of the Jewish population.”

O’Connor said, “This country cannot stand if the judiciary is intimidated.” That’s what she believes lawmakers were attempting to do when they repeatedly defied court orders related to the maps, missed deadlines and threatened to impeach her.

The court ultimately decided not to hold the Legislature or members of the Ohio Redistricting Commission in contempt, O’Connor said, because it could have created a constitutional crisis.

“I did not want to create that on my watch,” she said. “I don’t think it was necessary.”

O’Connor dismissed suggestions that her gender played into the virulence of the pushback against her. That has included a fight over the placement of her official court portrait and the removal of her image from the photo gallery at Ohio Republican Party headquarters.

“No, because I think they think that if you’re a registered Republican, that’s going to affect everything you do in your job,” she said.

The few critics who contacted her felt the same way, she said.

“They said, ‘Ohio is a red state, why are you trying to turn it blue?’ These were the type of things that people were saying,” she said. “It’s like, OK, I’m a judge. I’m not trying to turn it blue or red or purple or pink. That’s not my role.”

O’Connor, the longest-serving woman in statewide elected office in Ohio, has been a consistent voice at the state and national levels against the politicization of the judiciary. In retirement, she has pledged to champion a constitutional amendment that fixes Ohio’s redistricting process, which was put in place in separate, widely supported ballot initiatives in 2015 and 2018.

She said that it’s too soon to say exactly what the proposal or the campaign for its passage will look like, “but it’s not going to be a one-woman band, let’s put it that way. There are a lot of people interested in doing this right.”

O’Connor didn’t mince words when asked about an 11th-hour effort to increase the threshold for passing constitutional amendments from a simple majority to a 60% supermajority. The idea was championed by Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose and state Rep. Brian Stewart, both Republicans.

“It’s a pretty transparent attempt to thwart a constitutional amendment,” O’Connor said.

LaRose has said the new threshold would assure changes to Ohio’s founding document that have strong bipartisan support. A resolution that would have put the question to voters died in the House last week for lack of votes. Legislative leaders said they may try again in January.

At the end of the day, O’Connor said that she’s “not traumatized” by being forced to leave office because of her age.

“I always joke that there’s that scene in ‘Braveheart’ where they’re running down the field and Mel Gibson’s yelling, ‘Freedom!’ You know? I get it. I understand what he was talking about,” she said.",Q4

MARICOPA COUNTY, Ariz. — Wearing a shirt with two of her sister's pictures on it, Beatrice X. Johnson stands back in Perry Park in Phoenix.

""Even though this wasn't the home we chose for her, this is the home she chose,"" Johnson said.

Johnson's sister, Dorothy Jean Dale-Chambers, lived at Perry Park, unsheltered.

While Chambers lived here, Johnson said she and other family members would come to check on her and bring her food.

""She was so funny; she loved music,"" Johnson said.

In April 2022, Chambers and her boyfriend, Joseph Gutierrez, were struck by a truck and killed in the nearby crosswalk at 32nd and Yale streets.

""I want my sister to be remembered as a human being and not a throwaway,"" Johnson said. ""She was not a throwaway. Joseph Gutierrez was not a throwaway.""

The couple is just two people out of 736 people experiencing homelessness that have died so far this year, according to Maricopa County data.

There could be another 450 people, but the county hasn't determined if they were homeless.

Their names now hang on a banner at one of Central Arizona Shelter Services' shelters in honor of National Homeless Persons' Remembrance Day on Wednesday.

""We really are at a crisis,"" said Lisa Glow, president and CEO of CASS.

The hundreds who have died this year already exceed last year's total by 42%, and the year isn't over yet.

""They represent individuals, and they're individuals you may know. They are individuals who never imagined they would be homeless,"" Glow said.

While the data provided to 12News by Maricopa County doesn't include those who've died so far in December, at least 112 of those known to be homeless this year were murdered. At least 60 people died of natural causes.

""We do know that people who experience longtime homelessness have more health issues. They die younger. So we need to get them off the streets and provide the support that's needed,"" Glow said.

While CASS and other organizations have expanded shelter space this year and have more plans for the future, Glow said more is still needed.

""The lack of shelter is leading to those increased street deaths. We've even had babies die in the streets, lot of seniors dying on the streets. That definitely keeps me up at night,"" Glow said.

Despite her sister being struck and killed months ago, Johnson still returns to help those who live unsheltered at Perry Park, recognizing the need there

""There are those of us out here, who will be relinquishing our last breath to make sure that this doesn't happen to the next person who's unsheltered,"" Johnson said.

by Vittoria Scarpa

19/10/2022 - Francesca Comencini directs the first few episodes of the new series which loosely revisits Sergio Corbucci’s 1966 film in a contemporary, female key

A contemporary, female, psychological revisiting of the western genre which leaves room for a new typology of heroes and antiheroes, which drills down into characters’ emotional spheres and, through the utopian dream of a city which welcomes everyone with open arms, which also speaks of the present: Francesca Comencini’s TV series Django has enjoyed its world premiere within the 17th Rome Film Fest’s Freestyle section. Helming the first four episodes of the series, and acting as artistic director for the entire project, the Roman director (Lo spazio bianco , Stories of Love that Cannot Belong to This World , series Gomorrah and Luna nera ) has pulled a blinder with this ambitious English-language production by Sky and Canal+, which boasts an exceptional international cast and is loosely based on Sergio Corbucci’s 1966 movie. The first two episodes, which were screened in Rome, left audiences thrilled and fascinated. But they’ll have to wait until 2023 to see the remaining eight, which Enrico Maria Artiale (The After Match , series Romulus) and Brit David Evans (Downton Abbey) will take it in turns to direct.

(The article continues below - Commercial information)

In the meantime, Roman audiences were given a taster of this new Django, who borrows the features of the brilliant Matthias Schoenaerts, a gunslinger with a melancholic air and a father tormented by feelings of guilt, who goes hunting for the truth about his family’s massacre in New Babylon, a town built in a crater in Texas. Seven years have passed since the end of the American Civil War, and a small community of white and black people live in this place where weapons aren’t allowed and where everyone is free and equal. The founder of New Babylon, John Ellis (Brit Nicholas Pinnock), is about to marry young orphan Sarah (German actress of Italian origin Lisa Vicari), when the arrival of a mysterious cowboy called Django calls everything into question and throws the city off-balance.

After an adrenaline-filled fight scene where the new arrival shows his strength, not to mention his good heart, Sarah’s eyes meet Django’s: he’s the father she hasn’t seen since she was a child. The sole survivor of the family massacre, Sarah holds her father responsible for what happened and refuses to forgive him. But Django doesn’t give up; he’s willing to do anything it takes to win back his daughter’s love, a deep and tender love which is conveyed through glorious flashbacks to a happy, past family life. He subsequently offers Ellis much-needed help to defend New Babylon from Elizabeth Thurman (the brilliant Noomi Rapace, who was handed the Progressive Career Award in Rome by jury president, director Marjane Satrapi). Ultra-Catholic Elizabeth is the powerful governor of neighbouring Elmdale who would like to annihilate New Babylon’s sinful community, depriving them of all aid. But New Babylon realises it has a new weapon in its armoury to guarantee its survival: oil.

A male protagonist wrestling with his emotions; a female antagonist who proves to be the fiercest defender of the patriarchal order… In Comencini’s Django, the roles are subverted to astonishing effect, against the backdrop of a society where diversity is seen as an opportunity for the future by some, and as an out-and-out threat by others: in short, it’s an incredibly current context. All of which is enveloped in a visually captivating style and endowed with a frantic pace, suffering no shortage of shoot outs, hangings, staring contests and wild landscapes. It’s definitely a good start for this new take on the Wild West.

Django is an Italian-French co-production by Sky and Canal+. It will be broadcast in 2023, screening exclusively on Sky and streaming on Now in all territories where Sky is active, as well as on Canal+ in France, Switzerland, Benelux and Africa. International distribution is entrusted to Studiocanal.

25-year-old Jordan Jacobs was sentenced to life behind bars on Wednesday.

On July 7, 2021, Jacobs was walking in Plano when he passed Steven Gambles, a complete stranger who was meeting a friend for dinner.

Jacobs told his girlfriend that Gambles had been looking at her, so he was going to rob him in retaliation, according to investigators.

Prosecutors say that Jacobs went back to his apartment and changed into a long sleeve security jacket, dark pants and a mask as a disguised. He then drove around the area waiting for Gambles to return to his car.

SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. – The rustic bar and restaurant known as Steamers Bar and Grill will be reopening under the ownership of Paul Brenner and Heather Cords.

Paul and Heather were customers first. One night in 2019 they stopped by Steamers and were having a cocktail at the bar when they overheard then-owner Kelly Sheehan talking to a patron about wanting to sell. The pair were living on the west slope, with Heather working at the El Dorado Saloon. Paul was in food and beverage in San Francisco before a 20-year career in IT. Before COVID he was working with a hospital network.

That one night in 2019 started the conversation, then COVID hit. Then the Caldor Fire threatened the community. Then it turned into nights working behind the bar and getting to know the customers as they prepared to purchase the business that started decades ago as a personal home before becoming TJ’s Peanut Farm, then later Steamers.

They started the process with licensing with the Alcohol Beverage Control (ABC), talking to customers to see what they liked, and what they’d like to see changed. They met with staff and they’re staying to work under Paul and Heather.

The name Steamers is a tribute to the original mode of transportation on Lake Tahoe – the steamships. They will bring back old steamer photos, and menu items will bear the names of some of those original ships like the SS Tahoe, the Emerald, and the Meteor among many others.

As they wait for the final permits, the pair have been cleaning, scrubbing, fixing lighting, and replacing the old fryer, and creating a new logo.

“Old buildings have surprises,” said Paul of things they’ve found.

They hope to be open by Halloween.

The hardest part of going through the closed phase has been keeping staff waiting to work and without a salary.

There is a live music space that they will fix up, and they’re planning to keep popular activities at the bar, and they already sponsored a softball team. A lot of Heather’s customers at the El Dorado Saloon in El Dorado Hills were already Steamers’ customers, so she’ll see a lot of familiar faces once opened.

Oh, did I mention they’re keeping the famous tacos?

Steamed clams will also find a place on the menu, as well as other favorites, along with items for those gluten and dairy free.

For first-time bar owners, Steamers was the perfect size for them and they’ll be announcing their opening date on Facebook and their website https://www.steamersbargrill.com/. Many people have noticed vehicles in the parking lot and stopping by for lunch, beer and cocktails. Paul and Heather say it’s been tough to tell everyone they’re not open yet, but with the final permits almost in hand, it won’t be long.

Back when the building that houses Steamers was built, it was the home of Columbus “Flip” Brandi. In those days people bought one-acre parcels on US50/Lake Tahoe Blvd. for $500. He built his business on part of that parcel which was the weekly newspaper Lake Tahoe News (where the cinderblock building that was most recently Verizon was built and will soon be home to Limonada Tahoe, made famous with their lemonade at farmer’s markets).

Flip got the nickname for knowing martial arts. He drove the South Lake Tahoe school bus, and long-time local Dave Wakeman said he’d sweep out the bus in exchange for judo lessons. Dave said Flip was also boxer Jack Dempsey’s instructor. The house did not survive the big winter of 51/52, just like over 100 other buildings that fell down. It was originally in the shape of a barn and the roof caved in that historic winter. Most fell down in spring because the vast amount of snow kept the walls up and the snow was stacked up to the eaves. Once the snow melted the walls would bow out, then the roof would come down. Flip rebuilt just as many others did.

The business has had several owners, including Victor and LuLu Jacobsen, Barb Carpenter, Tom Miller, Doc Llamas, and most recently Kelly and Dennis Sheehan.

Court records are providing more clarity on what could have happened before 47-year-old Rory Mehen and 45-year-old Sara Mehen were shot and killed at the Hartland Inn in New Meadows on Oct. 1 -- and prosecutors have filed to seek the death penalty.

John Cody Hart was identified as the suspect who allegedly shot and killed the couple, after he was found not competent to stand trial for assault charges in Washington. Hart was awaiting admittance to Western State Hospital, Washington's psychiatric hospital, if and when a bed opened up.

On that Saturday, around 12:45 p.m., police responded to reports of an active shooter -- they rushed in to the hotel to find the couple, who owned the hotel, dead in the main office.

According to an affidavit, Hart told Washington County detective Jordan Doggett that he had gone through drawers in rooms inside the inn, looking for socks that he thought belonged to his children. At that time, a man and a woman asserted to him that he could not be going through other residents' rooms.

""John told us they then snatched everything from his hands, making him feel like a thief. They then called the cops,"" the affidavit said. ""John stated that this made him angry, that it caused him pain, and that he felt the couple were like Bonnie and Clyde.""

The affidavit says call records show a deputy was called to the inn where he spoke with Hart and cleared the hotel at 12:20 p.m. The 911 call of shots fired came in 24 minutes later, at 12:45 p.m.

Before the shots rang out, the affidavit says Hart went back to this room after the socks were taken from him and ""prepared for the worst.""

""He then heard Pope Gregory and John Paul say, 'are you going to let Bonnie and Clyde do that to our family,'"" the affidavit says. ""John told me that he didn't spite those people, and that they still have life in their soul, not in their flesh.""

The document says that Hart then told detectives he went to the front counter and shot the man and woman.

The affidavit said there is probable cause to believe that Hart murdered the two in the first-degree -- ""these actions took ample time,"" the document said.

The prosecuting attorney for Adams County filed to seek the death penalty in this case, where they said ""the murder was especially heinous,"" that Hart ""exhibited utter disregard for human life,"" and that Hart could ""probably constitute a continuing threat to society.""

Hart is being held without bail until his next hearing. A status conference is set for Oct. 17.

Hart's case in Washington

KTVB filed a public records request with the superior court in Clark County, Washington, where Hart was charged with felony assault in August of 2021, to obtain a recording of the hearing in which a judge let Hart out of jail.

An evaluation found Hart wasn't competent to stand trial for his assault charges. Judge Robert Lewis entered a competency restoration order for a 90-day restoration at Western State Hospital, the state psychiatric hospital, on March 17,

Hart was waiting in jail until a bed opened up; 127 days after the judge's order, he still sat in jail.

Hart, his attorney and the prosecution appeared in front of Judge Lewis via video conference in the July 22, 2022 review hearing on Hart's competency.

In this hearing, the defense asked Hart be let out because he was assaulted in jail and was waiting too long to get transported to Western State Hospital.

The lead prosecutor tried for months to get Hart into the hospital, but told KTVB this week that a bed wasn't open.

In this July hearing, another prosecutor told the judge they expected Hart to be transported just days after this hearing, on Aug. 1. They asked the judge to push this matter back until then to see if Hart did in fact get admitted.

The judge, however, sided with the defense.

""The court has reviewed this matter extensively at request of the defense and given the state ample opportunity both from local representatives and from the State of Washington to provide an explanation as to why - despite repeated dates when they indicated he would be transported - Mr. Hart has not been transported for competency restoration,"" Judge Lewis said. ""His motion to dismiss is denied. His motion to release is granted. He'll be released on supervised release.""

""I do this with some reluctance as the charges against Mr. Hart are very serious,"" the judge told Hart, his defense and the prosecution, ""He's charged with a Class-A felony: assault in the first degree. Apparently, however, the seriousness of his charges is not sufficient for the state to place a priority upon his competency restoration. I simply can't continue to hold him on the expectation that maybe someday they'll come pick him up.""",Q4

McCarthy’s fundraising team raised $20 million between July and September and raised more than $72 million in 2022, a record for the GOP leader. For the 2022 election cycle, McCarthy has raised $145 million.

The Republican leader’s intensive fundraising serves as a war chest Republicans could use to take back the House. Republicans only need to take back a net five seats to take the speaker’s gavel from Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).

McCarthy said in a statement on Tuesday, “As we get closer to Election Day, Republicans are charging ahead in our pursuit to take back the House. Thanks to our tremendous supporters we are closer than ever to achieving this goal, and bringing accountability back to our nation’s capital. We need to continue to focus on the end goal, and ensure that come November 8th we finally fire Nancy Pelosi.

The California conservative said that he transferred $52 million so far during the 2022 cycle to the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).

NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer (R-MN) told Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle that Pelosi has been making a worldwide “farewell tour” for months as she travels around the world. He noted that the Democrats’ campaign arm has been financially cutting off vulnerable Democrats for months.

Emmer guaranteed that Republicans would take back control of the House, McCarthy would be speaker, and that GOP could win control of the Senate “at the same time” because of turnout across the country.",Q4
https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/361152,Former staffer tells FBI Trump ordered Mar-a-Lago docs moved,"An employee of former President Donald Trump told the FBI that the ex-president ordered boxes of documents at Mar-a-Lago to be moved ahead of a search of the residence by federal agents, NBC News reported.

The source told the news outlet that the FBI possesses security video allegedly showing staffers moving boxes out of a Mar-a-Lago storage room.

The FBI raided Trump’s Florida home on August 8 where it discovered over 300 documents with classified markings inappropriately taken from the White House as well as thousands of other government documents.

According to the New York Times, the classified documents included material from the CIA, the National Security Agency and the FBI.

Trump has claimed that federal agents could have planted documents during their search. In a social media post on Wednesday, Trump called the federal raid an “unprecedented and unnecessary break in of my home.”

“There is no ‘crime’ having to do with the storage of documents at Mar-a- Lago, only in the minds of the Radical Left Lunatics who are destroying our country, and were just forced by the courts to give me back much of what they took (STOLE?) during their unprecedented and unnecessary break in of my home,” Trump said. “These people are CRAZY!!!”

According to the Washington Post, Trump lawyer Christina Bobb signed a letter in June certifying that Trump had complied with a May grand jury subpoena and had returned a large number of classified documents stored at Mar-a-Lago.

But the claim that boxes were moved ahead of the federal search appears to contradict the statement from the Trump camp that classified records had been returned in June.

Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich on Wednesday said that the Biden administration had politicized the investigation.

“The Biden administration has weaponized law enforcement and fabricated a document hoax in a desperate attempt to retain political power,” Budowich told NBC News. “Every other President has been given time and deference regarding the administration of documents, as the President has the ultimate authority to categorize records, and what materials should be classified.”",Q4

The new chapter, like the national organization, is led by a group of “experienced Americans,” people over the age of 60. When it comes to the fight against climate change, the chapter leaders say a simple way to do so is for people to take a look at where they keep their money.

“When I learned how important it is to make sure that the money that you have in a bank, or a credit card or in any type of investment is not being used to fuel the … dirty fuel pipeline,” member Mimi Plevin-Foust said, “I was very glad to know what a difference an individual can make.”

Dittie Wolin, a member of Third Act Ohio’s coordinating committee, said individuals and large companies moving their retirement funds to different banks can have a significant impact.

“People over 60, we have 70% of the wealth in this country, and a lot of that is tied up in our retirement funds,” she said. “So individually, we can move our retirement money out of fossil fuel funding organizations and companies and stuff. But … there are retirement funds that are in the billions, … and if we can advocate for them to move the funds, then it's a huge shift in where the money is being spent.”

Ygal Kaufman / Ideastream Public Media Woman holding sign outside Chase Bank chants along with other protesters.

The nation’s biggest banks are some of the top funders of the oil and gas industry, which contributes greatly to climate change, according to a study published by Rainforest Action Network. Of the U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase was the top funder in 2021, with more than $61.7 billion invested in the industry that year and a total of $382.4 billion invested between 2016 and 2021.

Third Act Ohio Secretary Ted Wolner said banks like Chase are able to use money earned through their customers’ credit card use, investment or savings accounts and other bank services to then invest in other industries that will turn a profit for the bank itself, like the fossil fuel industry.

“All of that, over any number of countries in which Chase is located around the world, creates a huge investment pool that Chase can tap for whatever projects or purposes it deems will return the most amount of money to itself and chase shareholders,” Wolner said.

In an emailed statement, Head of Sustainability Communications for JPMorgan Chase Charlotte Powell said the bank facilitated more than $100 billion in green activities such as renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable transportation in 2021. The bank also doubled its green investment banking activity and was the largest underwriter, or purchaser, of green bonds used to fund environmentally-friendly projects last year.

“These efforts help put us well on our way to our target of $1 trillion for green initiatives over 10 years, including for technology that will tackle climate change but does not even exist yet,” Powell said. “We are also taking pragmatic steps to meet our 2030 emission intensity reduction targets in oil & gas, electric power and automotive manufacturing, while helping the world meet its energy needs securely and affordably.”

JPMorgan Chase also aims to finance and facilitate more than $25 trillion by 2030 to advance long-term solutions for climate change, according to its website.

But by funding fossil fuel projects, Third Act Ohio Secretary Ted Wolner said the big banks are going against recommendations made by The International Energy Agency in 2021.

“The Internal Energy Agency said almost a year ago that to have any hope of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, we have to stop funding fossil fuel projects -- any new ones -- now,” he said. “Obviously we're still funding them. We're digging the hole deeper.”

Ygal Kaufman / Ideastream Public Media Climate change protesters gathered outside Chase Bank in Downtown Cleveland.

Last month, members and leaders of Third Act Ohio protested outside of Chase Bank in Downtown Cleveland and have held other protests in the state.

Membership coordinator Judy Smucker participated in protests around Athens before working to establish the Ohio chapter. She said she wanted to help out, in part, due to a feeling of guilt knowing that future generations will have to grow up living with the effects of climate change she never experienced.

“We’re standing with all the young people. We're trying to help them have a future,” she said. “We're the ones that did this. We're the over-60 people. We're the ones that have been adding to the pollution of the world.”",Q4

Now, they want to get paid themselves.

At a Dec. 1 hearing in York County, the team, led by Columbia trial lawyer John Lay and former U.S. Attorney for South Carolina Peter McCoy, will request more than $374,000 in fees for their work.

That money would come out of the fund they have generated to compensate the crowd of plaintiffs Murdaugh, a once-respected Hampton attorney, allegedly wronged during a decadelong blitz of fraud, theft and betrayal. Though substantial, it won't come close to covering the millions Murdaugh is accused of plundering from the people around him.

Lay and McCoy, known as the Murdaugh “receivers,” contend they have more than earned their proposed 30 percent fee, having spent nearly 2,200 hours on the case since their appointment in November 2021.

They point to their work issuing nearly 70 subpoenas to law firms, banks, attorneys and other individuals and then reviewing the thousands of financial records they received in response.

They say they put a stop to efforts by Murdaugh and his associates to shift the 54-year-old’s assets to relatives and preferred creditors. And they tout their negotiations with Murdaugh’s lawyers, business partners and banks to resolve complicated legal disputes over what remains of his properties and wealth.

A comprehensive analysis of landfill searches for human remains suggests if searchers don't start within a month of a body ending up in a landfill — and commit to spending at least as long looking — the potential for recovery drops dramatically.

""At the 30-day mark, the chances of being successful are near even, but they drop precipitously after a month has passed,"" wrote co-authors Kimberlee Sue Moran and Brian Paulsen — a former police chief in Plattsmouth, Neb. — in their 2019 study, which they believe to be the only broad research on landfill search feasibility done in North America.

""A search should not be initiated if more than 60 days had passed between the body entering the landfill and the search being initiated.""

The findings could provide valuable context as government and Manitoba-based law enforcement agencies consider whether to search Prairie Green landfill, north of Winnipeg, for the remains of Morgan Harris and Marcedes Myran.

Winnipeg police believe the two women were killed and their remains ended up at that dump in mid-May of this year — a conclusion investigators say they reached on June 20, though they did not disclose that publicly until this month.

Winnipeg police said on Thursday, Dec. 1, 2022, they charged Jeremy Skibicki with first-degree murder in the deaths of all three women, as well as a fourth, whom community members have named Buffalo Woman. (Submitted by Cambria Harris, Donna Bartlett and Darryl Contois)

Police announced on Dec. 1 that Jeremy Skibicki was charged with first-degree murder in their deaths, and that of a woman who hasn't yet been identified but has been given the name Buffalo Woman.

Skibicki had been charged months earlier with first-degree murder in the death of Rebecca Contois, who was also killed in May, according to police. Her partial remains were found at the Brady Road landfill in south Winnipeg, following a search there in June.

The charges have not yet gone to trial. Skibicki's lawyer has said he plans to plead not guilty to all four first-degree murder charges.

Growing calls for search

Police have faced growing calls to mount a search of Prairie Green after initially suggesting it wasn't feasible.

Protesters, including family and loved ones of victims, have blocked the Brady Road landfill recently, calling for a search of the site for other missing people.

Manitoba's premier and Winnipeg's mayor announced on Dec. 8 operations at the Prairie Green had been paused following such calls. Last week, the federal government committed to footing the bill for a feasibility study on a possible search.

The authors of the American study, which was published in the journal Forensic Archaeology in January 2019, reviewed 46 landfill searches in the U.S. between 1999 and 2009. Of those, 20 — or 43 per cent — were successful. The successful searches took 17 days on average.

The research found one of the most important factors was the time between when a victim's remains ended up in a landfill and when the search began, according to Paulsen.

Searches that got underway within 30 days of remains being deposited were most successful, and searching for at least 30 days also increased the odds of success. Over 90 per cent of the successful recoveries happened within that ""magic"" window, said Paulsen.

The study discourages law enforcement from searching after two months had passed.

""There was instances of recovery after 30 days, but it was much, much rarer,"" Paulsen said in an interview with Marcy Markusa, host of CBC Manitoba's Information Radio.

Factors that might impede an investigation include how much time has elapsed, resources, weather conditions and potential hazards searchers could encounter, he said.

Success typically also hinges on whether landfill managers can roughly pinpoint the location of where remains may have been deposited.

That depends on the quality of record keeping at a landfill and whether or not garbage trucks dropping off loads there have GPS location data tracking, which is true of many jurisdictions in the U.S.

""Having that location is paramount, just a starting point, and it goes slow. It goes very, very slow,"" said Paulsen.

'Extremely hard' to call off search

One 2003 Nebraska case he was directly involved with shows the importance of that information, Paulsen said.

The father of Brendan Gonzalez, a four-year-old boy, confessed to killing the child and showed police to the trash bin where he discarded his son's body.

Police managed to pinpoint when that trash was taken to a landfill in Springfield, Neb.

But they didn't learn that information and start looking until about six months after the fact, Paulsen says — similar to the amount of time that has passed since remains of Harris and Myran are believed to have been taken to Prairie Green.

Investigators didn't have GPS garbage truck location data in that case, but the landfill manager ""was extremely confident that he knew exactly where we needed to go,"" Paulsen said.

""Absent of the landfill manager having noted where we were searching on the day after the murder, I don't know if we would've been so aggressive in going in,"" Paulsen said.

But after an unsuccessful month, the search was called off.

""It was extremely hard for myself and the assistant chief to be with the mother and the grandmother and say we were stopping the search,"" Paulsen said.

""Everybody was confident that we were going to find him ... but in the end it came down to we just didn't know where to go.""

That case is the only unsuccessful landfill search in Nebraska history, according to Paulsen. Two subsequent searches resulted in the discovery of remains.

In one case, the remains of a baby were found after a landfill was shut down within six hours of the infant's disappearance being reported, Paulsen said.

The other successful search was more extensive, but fell within the ""magic window"" of 30 days, he said.

Thomas McAfee, a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation who served as a senior team leader with the American bureau's evidence response team for eight years, agreed that the passage of time, availability of records and volume of debris are all factors in searches.

McAfee has been involved in four landfill searches where the FBI worked with local police forces. None resulted in the recovery of a body.

""You really need to have a lot of the pieces of the puzzle solved before you start digging,"" he said in an interview with Information Radio.

A search is less likely to be successful ""if you don't have solid, workable intelligence that the person went missing on date X and we shut down the landfill almost immediately, and we know they went to this dumpster, and this dumpster went to this area.""

But as officials consider whether to search Prairie Green in Manitoba, the likelihood of success isn't the only factor to consider, he said.

""There's typically a lot of emotions,"" said McAfee.

""Investigators want to do right by the victim and the victim's family — bring them home.""

Francisquini, who is wanted on a murder charge in the Nov. 18 death of his 11-month-old daughter.

The FBI in New Haven and Naugatuck police are requesting assistance in locating Francisquini, who should be considered armed and dangerous and mentally unstable, police said Tuesday. The reward for information that leads to his arrest and conviction has been increased to $25,000, police said.

Christopher Francisquini has ties to New York, Waterbury, and New Haven, where he was last seen on Quinnipiac Avenue, police said.

Toddler Camilla Francisquini was laid to rest last Friday in a private ceremony, police said.

Camilla Francisquini

Camilla was found dead by a family member inside a home on Millville Avenue in Naugatuck on Nov. 18. Her body had been dismembered, police said.

The toddler’s death was ruled a homicide and police have been searching tirelessly for her father, who police say is their prime suspect in the brutal slaying.

The Chief Medical Examiner’s Office ruled that Camilla’s cause of death was neck compressions and stab wounds, officials said.

Police obtained an arrest warrant charging Francisquini with murder with special circumstances — the most serious charge a person can face in Connecticut, which comes with a mandatory life sentence if convicted — and risk of injury to a minor.

Police said Francisquini was allegedly involved in a dispute with Camilla’s mother in Waterbury after the killing, police said. The mother was not injured in the dispute.

Francisquini then took off a court-ordered GPS tracking device and destroyed his cell phone, police said.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1715822/sarah-inam-murder-police-arrest-shahnawaz-amirs-mother-after-court-dismisses-her-bail,Sarah Inam murder: Police arrest Shahnawaz Amir's mother after court dismisses her bail,"Police arrested the mother of the main suspect in the Sarah Inam murder case outside a district and sessions court in Islamabad on Wednesday after a judge dismissed her pre-arrest bail.

Sameena Shah was initially interim granted bail on September 26, three days after police arrested Shahnawaz for allegedly killing his Canadian national wife.

The murder allegedly took place at a farmhouse located in the capital's Shahzad Town area, where Shahnawaz lived along with Sameena.

Police had issued arrest warrants for Shahnawaz's parents, Sameena and senior journalist Ayaz Amir, a day after his arrest. While Ayaz has been discharged from the case, Sameena had been on bail until now.

The matter of her bail was taken up by Additional Sessions Judge Sohail Sheikh today, before whom Sameena appeared along with her lawyer.

He dismissed her bail after the investigating officer submitted the case record to him, and the complainant's lawyer, Rao Abdur Rehman, presented his arguments against further extension in the bail.

""Sameena Shah has been nominated as a suspect due to her statements,"" he contended, adding, ""all [her] excuses are meaningless in the eyes of the law.""

He said Sameena could not escape the consequences and that she came to know about the murder.

According to the police record, her bail should not be extended further, he added.

He prayed the court to dismiss Sameena's pre-arrest bail.

The court accepted his request, following which Shahzad Town police arrested her outside the court.

Sameena's bail plea

In her petition, Sameena presented her version of the incident, stating that Shahnawaz had left her a WhatsApp message “before the heinous crime”, asking to set up Sarah’s rukhsati by speaking to her father.

“Everything was normal the night before the crime took place,” she said.

Sameena said she retired for the night after receiving the message and was informed about the incident by Shahnawaz, who had called her on her mobile phone at 9:12am the next day.

Thereafter, Sameena rushed to Shahnawaz’s room, the petition said, adding that by the time she reached the room, Sarah had already expired.

“The petitioner asked Shahnawaz to stay in her room and Ayaz (Amir) called the police, and within a few minutes, the police arrived and took custody of Shahnawaz,” the plea read.

Sameena termed the FIR “false and frivolous” and stated that she had no connection with the case or the murder. “But her name is being mentioned by the media that an application has been moved for her arrest,” the petition said.

Adding that Sameena “was not even an eyewitness to the incident”, the plea stated that “her reputable name is being added for no reason but to jeopardise her years [of] reputation, which clearly establishes the mala fide intent and ulterior motives”.

Moreover, the plea mentioned that Sameena was an elderly woman with health issues and said she was willing to furnish sureties against bail, as well as “comply with an investigation that may be conducted by law enforcement agencies”.

The case

Police have become a complainant in the case, with a first information report (FIR) registered for the murder on the complaint of Shahzad Town Station House Officer Nawazish Ali Khan at the Chak Shahzad police station, initially under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).

Later, police added Section 109 (punishment for abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) of the PPC to the FIR and initiated proceedings against Shahnawaz’s parents, Sameena and senior journalist Ayaz Amir.

The development came after Sarah’s uncle filed an application with police, alleging that Shahnawaz had murdered Sarah in connivance with his parents.

According to the FIR, Shahzad Town police station SHO Sub-Inspector Nawazish Ali Khan was present on Park Road near Chatha Bakhtawar when he got the information about the murder.

The FIR stated that when the police team reached the farmhouse where the murder had taken place, they were received by the mother of the main suspect who told them that her son had “murdered his wife during a scuffle”.

As per the FIR, she informed the police that her son was still present in the house. The police managed to enter the house and detained the suspect, it claimed, adding that the suspect’s hands were “soaked in blood” at the time of the arrest.

During the inquiry, the man identified himself as Shahnawaz Amir and told the police that he had murdered his wife with a dumbbell and hid her body in a bathtub in the bathroom, it claimed.

Police recovered the dead body on his information, the FIR said, adding that a wound was found on the head of the deceased. The police team also recovered the murder weapon from the house which was “hidden under a bed”, it added.

Subsequently, the body was moved to the Poly Clinic for autopsy and the murder weapon and the shirt of the accused were sent for a forensic audit.",Q4

The 19-year-old victim and her boyfriend had just returned from a restaurant and were sitting in a vehicle at the corner of W. 165th St. and Broadway in Washington Heights around 9 p.m. Monday when a fight broke out between two groups of men nearby, police sources said.

One of the men pulled a gun and began blasting away at his rivals.

Police investigate after a woman was shot on Broadway and W. 165th St. in Manhattan Monday.

At least four shots were haphazardly fired, cops said. A bullet punched its way into the pregnant woman’s car and hit her in the leg, cops said.

The woman lived just steps from where she was hit.

“The woman was hit in the thigh,” said Ozzy Orengo, who witnessed the shooting. “Her left leg was bleeding. Her neighbor was holding her up. She was crying. She was saying, ‘It hurts! It hurts!’ in Spanish.”

Medics took the woman to Harlem Hospital, where she was treated for a minor wound, cops said.

“She told the paramedics she was pregnant when they put her in the ambulance,” said Orengo, 60. “Her mother was out here without a coat. Her mother was upset and crying, and the neighbor gave her a jacket.”

The shooters ran up Broadway to a waiting car, another witness recalled.

“They were little kids laughing,” the man said of the group with the gunman. “I couldn’t believe it. They ran down the block. It was crazy. They hit that poor little girl and that car.”

No arrests were made. Cops were searching for the gunman Tuesday.

Opinion

Trump, the Black

Hole and Me

By Patrick Healy Mr. Healy is the deputy Opinion

editor. From 2018 to 2021,

he was the

politics editor at The Times.

When I was a political reporter at The Times covering the 2016 presidential race, a typical day went like this: Upwards of 16 Republican candidates would be crisscrossing the country, scrambling for slivers of voter and media attention, and then the 17th candidate, Donald Trump, would do something — hold a rally, give an interview, issue a statement, type a tweet — and all the political oxygen would be gone.

That may be an oversimplification, but Mr. Trump was a skilled disruptor, sucking up attention and knocking adversaries off kilter with blunt provocations like his juvenile tactics at the debates and his Muslim travel ban idea after a terrorist attack in California. By the time I became the politics editor at The Times in 2018 and Mr. Trump was president, I’d sometimes wake up in the morning and see a tweet of his and think, “There’s my day.” We had a very high bar for covering anything from his Twitter feed. Even so, his gravitational pull was unlike anything I’d ever seen in politics — relentless, immediate, destructive.

And it took a toll. How many people had their mental health affected by Mr. Trump? Are we supposed to think about the president on, like, a daily or hourly basis? I doubt even his supporters voted for that.

During those early Trump years, I saw a therapist who was helpful on many fronts, and I talked to him about the president from time to time. Those moments were a good stress relief: We would focus on the bigger picture, what I enjoyed in life and how the country had endured so much in its history. He encouraged me to keep a gratitude list, to focus on good fortune; once in a while, when Mr. Trump had done something irritating, my therapist would encourage me to pray for him. I learned at some point — I forget when — that my therapist was an admirer and supporter of Mr. Trump. If that colored our conversations, and sometimes they turned weird, I still valued having his perspective, seeing Mr. Trump through his eyes a bit.

But then came the pandemic and the 2020 election aftermath and the Jan. 6 attack. If many of us feel compelled to fixate on him — including plenty of Republicans I speak with — it’s because he’s done so much damage.

That apprehensiveness came rushing back as Mr. Trump’s announcement speech got underway in Florida on Tuesday night, as he talked about how America stood ready for a “golden age” when he left office and how “everyone was doing great” — ignoring facts like the deaths of 400,000 Americans from Covid by then, the profound damage to the economy and the deep fissures he carved in our society. How can he gloss over his record? How can he ignore the truth?

There’s something disempowering about letting Donald Trump dictate where your feelings swing day to day; there’s something empowering about focusing on something specific you want to change and putting your energy toward it. And the other thing to remember about feelings? They can disappear … just like that.",Q4
https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/weeklydemaddress,Weekly Dem radio address: Rep. Pope says medical experts are sounding the alarm on the lack of obstetricians and gynecologists in Wisconsin,"Hi, this is Representative Sondy Pope with this week’s Democratic Radio Address.

Starting, or adding, to your family can be one of the most joyful times in a person’s life. But for many women, finding maternity care is getting harder and harder. 27 of Wisconsin’s 72 counties do not have a single OB/GYN. The Mayo Clinic is ending labor and delivery services at its hospitals in Menomonie and Barron. And there are no maternity care providers of any kind in Rusk or Pepin counties.

This means that some of our neighbors and friends are at higher risk for poor maternal—and infant—health outcomes. And it’s only going to get worse.

The fear of being charged with a felony under Wisconsin’s archaic 1849 abortion ban, which is once again the law in our state, will make it difficult to recruit students interested in becoming OB-GYNs or family practice physicians in Wisconsin. You don’t have to take my word for it. Experts at the Wisconsin Medical Society and the UW Medical School are sounding the alarm.

My Democratic colleagues and I have tried to get the Republicans who control the Legislature to revisit the ban. But they refuse to work with us or Gov. Tony Evers. They have made it clear that they support a law enacted more than 170 years ago before women were even allowed to vote.

https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/shanquella-robinson-death-mexico-wants-american-extradited,Mexico wants American extradited for death of tourist Shanquella Robinson,"article

Mexican prosecutors have filed charges against a U.S. woman suspected of killing another American seen being beaten in a viral video.

Prosecutors in the state of Baja California Sur did not name the suspect in the Oct. 29 death of Shanquella Robinson.

But on Thursday, they said they had approached Mexican federal prosecutors and diplomats to try to get the woman extradited to face charges in Mexico.

Robinson's death at a resort development in San Jose del Cabo shocked people in both countries. The video raised suspicions that Robinson may have died at the hands of people she was traveling with.

Local prosecutor Antonio López Rodríguez said the case was being treated as a potential homicide and an arrest warrant had been issued for the suspect. The group Robinson was traveling with, however, left Mexico after she was found dead in a rented villa.

State prosecutor Daniel de la Rosa Anaya said the suspect was also an American, but did not identify her.

News outlets in Charlotte, North Carolina, reported that the people Robinson was traveling with gave differing versions of how she died, but that an autopsy revealed she died of a severe spinal cord or neck injury.

A video apparently taped at the luxury villa in San Jose del Cabo shows one woman, apparently an American, beating another woman identified as Robinson.

The video has been reposted many times on social media sites. In it, a man with an American accent can be heard saying, ""Can you at least fight back?"" The man did not appear to intervene in the beating.",Q4

Mercii Thomas says officers shot her with kinetic impact projectiles while she protested peacefully, knocking her out and causing a concussion. In May she sued the City and County of Denver, former Police Chief Paul Pazen, retired Cmdr. Patrick Phelan and three officers named as John Does.

Jury finds Denver police violated rights of protesters during 2020 George Floyd demonstrations; awards $14M

Magistrate Judge N. Reid Neureiter started a hearing Tuesday morning by scolding an attorney for the defendants, Sara Cook, for filing a dismissal motion, given refusals by other judges in similar cases to throw them out.

“The likelihood of me granting this motion to dismiss is close to zero,” Neureiter said, visibly annoyed.

Thomas’ lawsuit claims an officer shot her in the head with a kinetic impact projectile on May 30, 2020, while she demonstrated and had her hands up, knocking her unconscious. Her complaint says she had been trying to find a way out of the crowds of police and protesters to return to a hotel where she was staying. The wound required stitches and she still suffers from effects of a brain injury it caused, according to the complaint. Other officers continued to hit her with projectiles while Thomas lay on the ground, she claims.

Her lawsuit argues the defendants violated her First Amendment rights to free speech and assembly, her Fourth Amendment protection against excessive force and her Fourteenth Amendment right for due process. It alleges a failure to train and supervise by Denver, Phelan and Pazen. It also claims the city’s “customs, policies, practices, training, and supervision” led to the violation of Thomas’ rights.

Cook argued Thomas' allegations were unsupported regarding Denver’s liability for violations of her constitutional rights. She also requested qualified immunity for Pazen and Phelan, who was commander of the police department’s special operations division. Qualified immunity protects government officials from civil liability unless they have violated a clearly established right.

Judge denies Denver's request for new trial in 2020 protest lawsuit; agrees to reduce award against 1 officer

Featured Local Savings

But Neureiter denied the dismissal request in full Tuesday. He was moved by a recent order made by Judge Regina Rodriguez in another case arising from the 2020 protests with similar facts. Rodriguez adopted a recommendation made by Magistrate Kato Crews to allow the case to go forward. Neureiter also referenced a decision by Judge R. Brooke Jackson to issue a temporary restraining order in the early days of the protests limiting police’s use of less-lethal weapons and a later denial of a request for summary judgment. Jackson presided over a trial brought by a group of protesters that resulted in a nearly $14 million jury verdict against Denver.

“It would be a hard slog for me to grant a motion to dismiss when I’ve got three of my distinguished colleagues, on basically the exact same facts, denying a motion to dismiss,” Neureiter said.

He did not appear persuaded by Cook’s argument that Phelan and Pazen should be shielded from liability because they did not know about officers’ actions against Thomas specifically. Is it not enough, Neureiter asked, that they authorized the use of force against thousands of people and did not stop the indiscriminate use of munitions?

He also seemed skeptical of the argument that Thomas’ claims made in her lawsuit drew conclusions without support.

“The defendants authorized the use of (munitions) on peaceful protesters. … That’s not conclusory. That’s a factual allegation,” he told Cook.

“I don’t think it’s a fact that is entitled to the presumption of truth,” she replied.

Darold Killmer, a partner at civil rights law firm Killmer Lane & Newman representing Thomas, asked Neureiter to send a message to the Denver City Attorney’s Office by denying the dismissal request.

“This is the opposite of conclusory allegations. This is an astonishing presentation of (factual) evidence,” Killmer said.

https://lasvegassun.com/news/2022/nov/09/candidates-who-backed-overturning-trump-loss-are-r/,Candidates who backed overturning Trump loss are rebuffed,"Republicans made a striking decision earlier this year to nominate candidates for top statewide posts in swing states who backed overturning President Donald Trump's loss in 2020. Most of those candidates lost in the midterm election.

Doug Mastriano, who commissioned buses to take Pennsylvanians to the Jan. 6, 2021, protests in Washington failed in his bid to become that state's governor. Kristina Karamo, a community college instructor who spread misinformation about voting on Twitter even on Election Day, was crushed by Michigan's Democratic secretary of state.

Mathew DePerno, an attorney who filed a lawsuit spreading Trump's election lies in Michigan in 2020, lost his bid to be that state's attorney general. Audrey Trujillo, a political novice who cheered Trump's defiance of the vote in 2020, was defeated for New Mexico secretary of state.

Two such races remained too close to call on Wednesday — Arizona and Nevada. And in more conservative states, from Indiana to Kansas, election conspiracy theorists still won key positions.

Many observers argued that the 2022 midterm election has shown that imperiling democracy is not politically successful.

“It turns out that trying to overturn an election is not wildly popular with the American people,” said Whit Ayres, a veteran Republican pollster.

That even extends to Arizona, Ayres added, where a prominent former television newscaster-turned-election-conspiracy-theorist, Kari Lake, remains in a right race for governor against Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, whose campaign has been widely panned.

""The fact that it is close with a very polished, very good Republican candidate and a very weak, very unpolished Democratic candidate tells you how much of a weight election denial is on a Republican candidate,” Ayres said.

Lies and conspiracy theories about elections burrowed deeply into the 2022 Republican field, with nearly one-third of the party's 85 candidates for governor, secretary of state and attorney general embracing Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 loss.

About half of those won — almost all of them incumbents, except for candidates such as Kris Kobach, a member of Trump's 2016 voter fraud commission who won the race for attorney general in Kansas, and Chuck Gray, a Wyoming state representative who ran unopposed for secretary of state in that heavily Republican state.

More significant are the outcomes in the six states that clinched Joe Biden's win in 2020 and where Trump and his allies disputed his loss.

In most of those states, as in most of the country, the secretary of state is the top election official while the governor and attorney general often play key roles in voting rules and certifying election results.

In Georgia, Trump unsuccessfully backed a slate of election conspiracy theorists in the GOP primary in May, seeking revenge against incumbent Republicans who rebuffed his requests to overturn his loss.

On Tuesday, Trump lost bids to install supporters in three more of those pivotal states. In Pennsylvania, Mastriano would have had the power to appoint a secretary of state to oversee voting, but he was routed in the governors race by Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro. In Wisconsin, Trump’s pick for governor, Tim Michels, lost to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, dooming Republican dreams of disbanding or significantly overhauling the state’s bipartisan election commission.

In Michigan, Karamo and DePerno had been key players in spreading misinformation about Trump's loss in 2020. Along with Tudor Dixon, the party's nominee for governor who repeated Trump's election lies, they provided a drag on the GOP ticket that contributed to Democrats capturing full control of the statehouse for the first time in decades.

In two other competitive states — Minnesota and New Mexico — GOP candidates for secretary of state who echoed Trump's election lies lost badly, performing worse than the top of their respective tickets.

“There are more of us pro-democracy Americans who are not Democrats — who look at the Republican Party and say ‘That is not for me’ — and that was borne out last night,” said Jeff Timmers, a former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party.

Nevada and Arizona will continue to test that idea as ballots are tallied in their close races for top statewide posts.

Nevada is where former state lawmaker Jim Marchant organized a coalition of election conspiracy theorists to run for voting posts nationwide as he himself ran for his state's secretary of state position.

Democracy advocates were optimistic on Wednesday, especially as some Republicans conceded their losses without alleging mass fraud.

""We’re seeing a bit of a scramble for the right message” among election deniers online, said Emma Steiner, who monitors disinformation for Common Cause.

She said concessions from candidates including Dixon in Michigan and Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania make ""it a little more difficult for election deniers to continue.”

But even as advocates celebrated, they kept a wary eye on Arizona and Nevada and acknowledged that Trump has inflicted grave damage on the trust in democracy that helps bind the country together.

“Without a doubt, election denial is alive and well, and this is a continuing threat,” said Joanna Lydgate of States United, which has sought to publicize the danger of election conspiracy theorists. But she took solace in Tuesday's results.

“It was a really good night for democracy,” Lydgate said.

Trade minister Conor Burns has been sacked from the government after a complaint of serious misconduct. Burns, 50, has also had the Tory whip removed while the allegations are investigated. The Telegraph said Burns is accused of inappropriate remarks and actions towards a younger man. He denies any wrongdoing. An ally of Burns questioned whether his perceived criticism of Truss during the conference, when he questioned diplomacy by Instagram, played a role in his hasty sacking.

2. Russia ‘preparing for nuclear war’

Volodymyr Zelensky said officials in Moscow have begun to “prepare their society” for the possible use of nuclear weapons. “They are not ready to do it, to use it,” he told the BBC. “But they begin to communicate. They don’t know whether they’ll use or not use it. I think it’s dangerous to even speak about it.” Meanwhile, Russia has targeted Zaporizhzhia with explosive-packed “kamikaze drones” for the first time, said The Guardian.

3. Elderly powering Covid wave

The elderly are driving a surge in Covid-19 infections but many have still not had an autumn booster, reported The Mirror. Unlike earlier waves, which started in the young, the current coronavirus wave is being powered by over-70s, said the Office for National Statistics. All over-50s are able to get a jab but so far only 6.6m of the 26m eligible have had one. Prof Sir Stephen Powis, NHS England medical director, said: “The threat of a Covid-19 and flu season creating a ‘twindemic’ this winter is real.”

4. Three die in Donegal explosion

Three people have died as a result of an explosion at a petrol station in County Donegal. The incident occurred in the village of Creeslough shortly after 3pm on Friday. A number of victims are being treated for injuries and it is thought that there are still people trapped in the rubble. The force of the blast was so strong that it shattered windows in a number of nearby buildings. Local parish priest Fr John Joe Duffy told RTE it was a “tragedy beyond belief” and “the heart has been torn out of our community”.

5. Truss considers childcare reform

Liz Truss is planning a shake-up of the childcare subsidy system so parents, rather than nurseries, are handed government cash to spend as they see fit, according to reports. Currently, three and four-year olds in England are entitled to 15 hours’ free childcare a week during term time, with the funding for each place sent directly to approved providers, such as nurseries or childminders. Ministers believe the high costs and complexities of childcare cause unnecessary disruption for parents.

6. NY mayor calls for migrant help

The mayor of New York City has declared a state of emergency to address a “crisis situation” over an influx of migrants. More than 17,000 have arrived in the city from the southern border since April, and since September an average of five to six buses have been arriving in the city each day, said Eric Adams. The influx is on track to cost New York $1bn (£900m) this fiscal year, and the mayor is calling for federal and state funding to help with the costs.

7. Moors search called off

A search for the last victim of the Moors murderers has been called off after no evidence of human remains were found. Greater Manchester Police began searching Saddleworth Moor on Friday after detectives received information from an author. However, analysis of a photo purporting to show a human bone found it to be “considerably smaller than a juvenile jaw” and it “cannot be ruled out that it is plant-based”, said the force. Keith Bennett was one of five youngsters killed by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley in the 1960s.

Liverpool will host next year’s Eurovision Song Contest, the BBC has announced. The city beat off Glasgow to grab the chance to host the show, with the grand final on 13 May 2023. Although Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra won this year’s competition, the organisers, the European Broadcasting Union, said it would not be safe to host next year’s contest in the country. The head of the Eurovision Song Contest, Martin Osterdahl, said that Liverpool was the “ideal place” to hold the competition next year.

9. Truss and Rees-Mogg ‘fraught’

Liz Truss is locked in a cabinet battle with Jacob Rees-Mogg over proposals to offer government advice on saving energy, said the i news site. The Business Secretary is continuing to push for a public campaign to save energy – but Truss has vetoed the proposals because she regards them as “nanny state”. Discussions between the pair were described as “fraught”. Meanwhile, said The Times, “the mood among cabinet ministers is bleak” and “after the most tumultuous party conference in decades, riven by infighting, revolts and U-turns, few think Truss can survive in the long term”.

Prince William was “furious” about how Queen Elizabeth II’s private secretary was ousted following a power struggle with the then Prince of Wales and the Duke of York, according to a new book. Lord Geidt, who had acted as a mentor to Prince William for years, was forced out from the Royal Household in 2017 after falling foul of Andrew and Charles in his bid to modernise the monarchy.

By Dion J. Pierre, The Algemeiner

Police in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, arrested three men accused of harassing members of the Hasidic Jewish community last week.

According to Yeshiva World, earlier in the week Shomrim, a Jewish community watch group, received reports that the men had driven around the neighborhood shooting Hasidic Jews with a gel gun from a white sedan. The group sprung to action, alerting the New York Police Department (NYPD) and assigning 50 volunteers to patrol the area to ensure a rapid response to the next incident.

The perpetrators soon struck again on Nov. 8 targeting a victim near Kent Avenue and Park Avenue. Shomrim’s officers were near the scene and straightaway alerted the police, who, having knowledge already of the make and model of their car, stopped it and arrested them.

Charges from the NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force, which is processing the case, are forthcoming.

On Thursday, New York City councilman Kalman Yeger, told The Algemeiner that the incidents are a consequence of New York’s lax crime policies.

“This is typical of what’s happening in New York City: criminal activity being perpetrated by criminals who do not believe there are any repercussions for their crimes,” Yeger said during an interview. “And, if they get caught, they will in all likelihood be out if they’re not already out now and likely be punished with a slap on the wrist, emboldened to then go on and escalate and do something worse, until, at same point they do something so heinously violent that we look back and see that they could have been stopped.”

A former Virginia police officer, believed to have murdered a teenager’s family in Riverside, California, after “catfishing” her online, was killed in a shootout while trying to flee authorities, the city’s police department said in a news release.

The ex-cop was identified as Austin Lee Edwards, 28, of North Chesterfield Virginia. Detectives said they believe Edwards had met the teen through “catfishing,” a form of online deception in which someone pretends to be a different person.

Officers with the Riverside Police were dispatched Friday to check the welfare of a young female who appeared distressed while getting into a red car with a man, police said. While officers were responding, 911 dispatchers began getting calls about a fire in the same neighborhood, just a few houses away from where the welfare check originated.

Firefighters discovered three adult victims lying in the front entryway of the burning home. When they pulled them outside, it was determined they were victims of an apparent homicide, the release stated.

A preliminary investigation determined the young female described in the initial call was a teenager who lived where the house fire and homicides occurred, police said.

According to police, Edwards had developed an online relationship with the teen and obtained her personal information. He then traveled from Virginia to Riverside, where he parked his vehicle in a neighbor’s driveway and walked to the teen’s home, the release stated. At some point, authorities believe Edwards murdered the teen’s grandfather, grandmother and mother before walking back to his vehicle with the teen and leaving.

Several hours after the bodies were found, Edwards was spotted driving with the teen through San Bernardino County, police said.

According to the release, Edwards exchanged gunfire with the San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies attempting to stop him, was shot by deputies, and was later pronounced dead at the scene.

The teen was unharmed and later placed into protective custody of the Riverside County Department of Public Social Services, police said.

Edwards resigned from the Virginia State Police in October, according to the agency. Detectives in California learned he was “recently employed at the Washington County Sheriff’s Office in the state of Virginia.”

“It is shocking and sad to the entire law enforcement community that such an evil and wicked person could infiltrate law enforcement while concealing his true identity as a computer predator and murderer. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Winek family, their friends, officers, and all of those affected by this heinous crime,” said Washington County Sheriff Blake Andis.

The victims have been identified as Mark Winek, 69, his wife Sharie Winek, 65, and their daughter Brooke Winek, 38. The exact cause and manner of their deaths are still pending.

“Mark, Sharie, and Brooke were loving people who didn’t deserve this tragedy,” the family of the victims said in a Monday statement. The family also thanked “everyone for their love, support, prayers and patience during this horrific time.”

“We are still processing the new information provided by authorities and will be speaking further at a press conference in conjunction with Riverside Police Dept. later this week. Please respect our privacy at this time,” the statement said.

The cause of the house fire continues to be under investigation, although it appears to have been intentionally ignited, according to the police news release.

“Our hearts go out to the Winek family and their loved ones during this time of tremendous grief, as this is a tragedy for all Riversiders,” city Police Chief Larry Gonzalez said in the release.

“This is yet another horrific reminder of the predators existing online who prey on our children. If you’ve already had a conversation with your kids on how to be safe online and on social media, have it again. If not, start it now to better protect them.”

But now the Tesla and SpaceX boss is in control of the social media platform.

Here is a timeline of how the deal unfolded:

– April 4: A filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows Mr Musk bought up just over 9% of Twitter shares, at the time making him the firm’s largest shareholder.

Elon Musk (Brian Lawless/PA)

– April 5: Twitter announces Mr Musk would be joining the company’s board.

– April 11: Mr Musk reverses his decision and Twitter confirms the billionaire will not be joining the board.

– April 14: Mr Musk submits an offer to buy the company outright and take it private. He offers 44 billion US dollars (£36.5 billion) – or 54.20 US dollars (£45) per share.

– April 15: In response, Twitter plans to implement what is known as a “poison pill” policy, which would allow existing shareholders to buy stock at discounted rates to dilute Mr Musk’s holdings and prevent the sale. But Mr Musk and Twitter enter into negotiations over a deal.

– April 25: A deal is agreed on the price Mr Musk initially offered – 44 billion US dollars.

– May 10: During a public appearance, Mr Musk says he would reverse Twitter’s current permanent ban on the account of former US president Donald Trump.

– May 14: Mr Musk begins to raise questions over the number of bot accounts on the platform and says the deal is “temporarily on hold” while he tries to find out more about the levels of spam and fake accounts on Twitter.

– May 16: Mr Musk continues to spar publicly with Twitter executives, sending a poo emoji in response to a tweet from Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal which reiterates the firm’s belief that only 5% of accounts on the site are bots.

Mr Musk also uses a public appearance later that day to suggest a deal for the platform could be done at a lower price and estimates that Twitter is, at best, 20% bots.

– May 17: Mr Musk says the deal “cannot move forward” until he gets “proof” that bots are only 5% of spam accounts on the platform. A number of experts suggest he is trying to force the renegotiation of the deal at a lower price.

On the same day, Twitter says it still planned to “close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement” with Mr Musk.

– June 6: Mr Musk says he has a “right to terminate the merger agreement” in a letter from his lawyers to Twitter’s legal team over what he claims is the company’s lack of co-operation over the spam accounts data.

– June 8: Twitter agrees to give Mr Musk access to its data “firehose” which contains the data around all public tweets to help with his investigation.

The Twitter app (Lauren Hurley/PA)

– July 7: The Washington Post reports that Mr Musk’s deal to buy Twitter is “in peril” after his team concluded Twitter’s figures on spam accounts are not verifiable.

– July 8: The deal collapses after Mr Musk sends a letter to the SEC saying he is terminating the acquisition.

In the letter, he says Twitter has “not complied with its contractual obligations” surrounding the deal, namely giving him enough information to “make an independent assessment of the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on Twitter’s platform”.

In response, the chair of Twitter’s board, Bret Taylor, said it is “committed” to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement.

– July 12: Twitter launches legal action. Mr Musk later countersues, accusing the company of misleading his team about the true size of its user base and other problems he said amounted to fraud and breach of contract.

– July 19: Judges in the US state of Delaware set a date in October for the trial.

– August 5: Court documents show that Twitter accused Mr Musk of “looking for an excuse” to get out of the deal because the stock market decline meant it was no longer favourable for him.

– August 6: Mr Musk publicly comments on how he can move forward with the deal in response to a Twitter user who posts a series of tweets about the bid.

He says: “Good summary of the problem. If Twitter simply provides their method of sampling 100 accounts and how they’re confirmed to be real, the deal should proceed on original terms. However, if it turns out that their SEC filings are materially false, then it should not.”

– August 23: A former company executive at Twitter turned whistleblower, Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, says the microblogging website has substantial security problems that place personal user data and potentially national security at risk.

In response, Twitter disputes Mr Zatko’s account, describing it as a “false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies”.

– October 4: Twitter said it plans to close a deal to sell the company to Mr Musk after receiving an offer.

– October 6: A judge delays the looming trial between Twitter and Mr Musk in order to give the billionaire time to complete the acquisition.

Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in! pic.twitter.com/D68z4K2wq7 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 26, 2022

– October 26: Mr Musk posts a video of himself entering Twitter’s head office in San Francisco, just days before the court deadline to complete the deal.

He also changes his Twitter bio to refer to himself as Chief Twit and updates his location to Twitter headquarters in a sign the deal looks set to be closed.

A Mountain View Police Department investigative report revealed details about the circumstances that led to the June 18 homicide case at a Shoreline Amphitheatre Chris Stapleton concert, in which a man died after he was allegedly punched once in the back of the head by a Hells Angels Motorcycle Club member. The victim suffered a traumatic brain injury, was put on life support and died a week and a half later.

Four of the five defendants identified as suspects in the case posted bail and are out of custody, according to the District Attorney’s Office. Logan Winterton, the only suspect charged with murder, remains in custody.

In a separate incident earlier that night, an off-duty police officer was “brutally assaulted by a group of men near a collection of portable restrooms before they walked away from the area,” police said in a Nov. 15 statement. As officers began investigating the incidents, they found that the suspects involved with both incidents knew one another and were associated with the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club.

Off-duty police officer beaten

According to an investigative report prepared by Mountain View Police Department Detective Jason Roldan, the first incident on June 18 began as suspects David Wiesenhaven and Raymond Cunanan were waiting in line to use a portable restroom. The first victim of the night, the off-duty police officer, was also waiting in line. According to the report, video surveillance shows the victim approaching Cunanan and standing beside him.

After what appeared to be a brief conversation, the report said, Cunanan put his drink down while the victim remained standing in place. Cunanan then put both hands around the victim’s neck and forcefully pushed him backward, out of the camera’s view.

A short while later, the victim came back into camera range and walked unsteadily, the report said. Winterton and Wiesenhaven approached the victim and one of them threw a beverage on him. One of them punched him in the face and caused him to fall, but the report said it’s unclear who punched him due to the camera angle. While the victim was on the ground, Winterton, Wiesenhaven, Cunanan and Julio Moran kicked and punched him, the report said. After the assault, the four suspects left the scene together.

According to the report, medical personnel responded to the scene at around 9:50 p.m. The officer was transported by ambulance to Stanford Hospital and treated for a broken orbital bone, discoloration to his eyes, loss of consciousness and significant facial swelling.

Fatal punch to the head

Later that night around 10:40 p.m., several Hells Angels members and associates were congregating in the Stage Right Cafe area of the amphitheater, a group that included suspects Winterton, Dominic Guardado, Wiesenhaven, Cunanan and Moran, the report states.

Juan Gonzalez, 41, walked through the group.

Winterton “looked and waved his hands in the direction” of the victim, the report said. Shortly after, the victim returned to the group and walked toward Zoe McGaughran, identified as Guardado’s girlfriend.

Gonzalez touched McGaughran’s shoulder in front of several Hell’s Angels members, and then walked away, the report said. While the victim walked away, “Winterton paced back and forth waving his hands from side to side in the air” while looking at the victim, the report stated. Winterton rolled up his sleeves before separating from the group and walking toward the victim. He then faced the group and rubbed his fist against his open palm, the report states, before turning around and walking toward the victim. Guardado, Wiesenhaven and Cunanan followed him.

According to another person who was present, Gonzalez was punched in the back of the head one time and fell face forward into the concrete. The person was 4 to 5 feet away when Gonzalez was punched. The victim didn’t see the suspect coming or have time to break his fall, according to the witness, the report states. Winterton is the prime suspect in the murder of Gonzalez, police said.

Another individual who was present saw Gonzalez lying on the ground and being crowded by several men from Hells Angels. One of the perpetrators poured beer on Gonzalez and said, “This is what you get,” followed by an expletive, the report states.

According to the report, after the victim was punched to the ground, Guardado, wearing his Hells Angels vest, cornered the first witness against a food truck. He allegedly said, “You didn’t see nothing!”, the report states. According to the second witness, Guardado lifted the first witness by the collar. The witness said he feared for his safety because he believes the Hells Angels to be a violent organization, and the police are identifying this witness as a victim.

As Guardado, Cunanan, Winterton and McGaughran left the area, another individual followed after them and called concert security over the phone. Cunanan appeared to overhear the third witness because he turned around and blocked the witness’s path. Cunanan said, “You won’t want to go after this guy,” according to the report. The third witness, fearing for their safety, stopped following the group and ran to a nearby security office, the report said, and police are also treating that witness as a victim.

At 10:53 p.m., Gonzalez was treated on the scene and then transported to the Stanford Hospital Emergency Room, the report said. He suffered a traumatic brain injury and had no brain activity. He was removed from life support on June 29.

The Santa Clara County Coroner’s Office performed an autopsy and found the cause of death to be blunt force trauma to the head and the case is classified as a homicide.

Winterton, 37, a San Francisco resident was charged with murder and assault likely to produce great bodily injury, and he’s the prime suspect in Gonzalez’s death, according to police. Winterton remains in custody “on no-bail allowed as he is the sole individual charged with causing the death of one of the victims,” Deputy District Attorney Irene Williams told the Voice.

Guardado, 33, of San Francisco was arrested on charges of dissuading a witness to a crime, meaning he allegedly attempted to prevent someone from saying anything after the attack, police said. Cunanan, 42, a Pleasant Hill resident, was charged with both dissuading a witness and assault likely to produce great bodily injury. Wiesenhaven, 38, a San Francisco resident, was charged with assault likely to produce great bodily injury. Moran, 43, a San Mateo resident, was charged with assault likely to produce great bodily injury. These four defendants are out of custody after posting bail, Williams told the Voice.",Q4
https://www.wkbw.com/news/state-news/new-yorks-gun-law-gets-reprieve-from-federal-appeals-court,New York's gun law gets reprieve from federal appeals court,"NEW YORK (AP - MODIFIED) — A federal appeals court on Wednesday allowed New York to continue enforcing its new gun law as it considers a lower court ruling that would block key provisions.

The decision from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came six days after a federal district judge in Syracuse declared multiple portions of the law unconstitutional and placed a temporary hold on them.

The state promptly appealed the order. The decision puts a hold on U.S. District Judge Glenn Suddaby's order until a three-judge appeals panel can make a decision on the state's motion.

Suddaby on Thursday put a hold on several of the state’s new licensing rules for carrying handguns in public, including one that made applicants turn over information about their social media accounts.

The judge also chipped away at the list of “sensitive” locations where people cannot carry guns. He said the state couldn't ban people from carrying guns in New York City’s subway system or Times Square.

Attorney General Letitia James said she was pleased the law would stay in effect.

""My office will continue our efforts to protect the safety of everyday New Yorkers and defend our common-sense gun laws,” she said in a prepared release.

Gov. Kathy Hochul and lawmakers rewrote the state’s handgun laws this summer after a Supreme Court ruling invalidated New York’s old system for granting permits to carry handguns outside the home. The high court struck down the state’s longstanding requirement that people demonstrate an unusual threat to their safety to qualify for such a license.

https://www.vanityfair.com/news/donald-trump-repeats-dictator-comment,"With A Smile and a Smirk, Donald Trump Repeats “Dictator” Comment","Former president and current GOP frontrunner Donald Trump gleefully reminded the audience that he’d become a ”dictator” for the first day of a second presidential term in a rambling keynote at the New York Young Republicans Club (NYYRC) annual gala at the ritzy Cipriani restaurant on Wall Street.

During his 80-minute speech to a crowd of 1,000 MAGA donors, politicians, and influencers on Saturday, Trump brought up viral comments he made last Tuesday in a town hall with Fox News host Sean Hannity, who asked the former president whether he would commit to not abusing his presidential power to retaliate against political enemies if re-elected in 2024.

Trump replied that he would only be a dictator on “day one.” “We’re closing the border. And we’re drilling, drilling, drilling,” he said. “After that, I’m not a dictator.”

The GOP frontrunner returned to the line Saturday. “[Peter] Baker today in The New York Times said that I want to be a dictator,” Trump complained, referencing an article covering how Trump and his allies are “leaning into” the charge that they plan on assuming dictatorial powers if re-elected. “I didn’t say that. I said I want to be a dictator for one day.”

In recent years, the NYYRC winter soiree has become something of a gathering point for the American far-right conservatives. At last year’s installment, NYYRC president Gavin Wax declared “total war” on the right’s political enemies, vowing to “do battle in every arena. In the media. In the courtroom. At the ballot box. And in the streets.”

The club’s president reprised those remarks Saturday night. “Since I know the deep state is listening tonight, once President Trump is back in office, we won’t be playing nice anymore,” Wax said. “It will be a time for retribution. All those responsible for destroying our once-great country will be held to account after baseless years of investigations, and government lies and media lies against this man,” he said, vowing “to turn the tables on these actual crooks and lock them up for a change.”

Trump greeted Wax’s speech warmly, twice calling it an “excellent speech.”

In his first-ever appearance at the 111-year-old annual event, the former president claimed that Democrats’ “newest hoax” is to call him a threat to democracy. “This is their new line. Here we go again — ‘Russia, Russia, Russia,’ ‘Mueller, Mueller, Mueller,’ ‘Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine.’ One hoax after another,” Trump added.

Trump also delivered a message to President Joe Biden, who greeted his original “day one” comment by joking, “Thank God, only one day.” “I can only say to Joe: Be very careful what you wish for, but [what] you have done is a terrible thing.”",Q4

QUETTA: One person was killed and 25 others were injured, 12 of them seriously, in a bomb blast at a sweet shop in Kohlu town of Balochistan on Friday.

Police said the bomb pla­nted by unidentified miscreants inside the shop in the main bazaar area went off when a large number people were there for purchasing sweets.

The shop was completely destroyed in the powerful blast. Many nearby shops and buildings were also damaged.

Soon after the explosion, police and personnel of other law enforcement agencies rushed to the site and shifted the body and the injured to the district headquarters hospital.

Police say time bomb, weighing over 2kg, was planted in a shop; nearly a dozen taken to hospital in Dera Ghazi Khan

“We have received one body and 25 injured,” Dr Asghar Marri, medical superintendent of the hospital, told Dawn, adding that the condition of at least 12 of the injured was serious.

They were shifted to Dera Ghazi Khan for treatment, as they received multiple injuries in the blast, he said. Officials said rescue teams reached the site and retri­eved some of the people from the debris of the shop.

Police rejected a perception that it was a gas cylinder blast, as initial investigation suggested it was bomb blast. “It was a time bomb, weighing over two kilograms, planted inside the sweet shop,” senior police officer Sariab Khetran confirmed when reached by telephone.

He said the bomb disposal squad personnel visited the site and collected evidence.

Balochistan Education Minister Mir Nasibullah Marri, who belongs to Kohlu district, reached the blast site and visited the hospital. He inquired after the health of the injured and asked the hospital management to provide best possible treatment to the victims.

CTD Kohlu registered a case against unidentified people and started an investigation. No one has claimed responsibility for the blast.

Acting Governor Mir Jan Mohammad Khan Jamali, Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo, Adviser on Home and Tribal Affairs Mir Ziaullah Langove and provincial minister Noor Moha­mmad Dummar strongly condemned the blast and said the elements involved in this inhuman act would be arrested soon.

At the time the student, identified as ""John Doe,"" made the comments over messaging platform Discord, it had been less than a year since two teenagers shot up a classroom and murdered 18-year-old Kendrick Castillo at STEM School Highlands Ranch — the same institution Doe attended.

""Plaintiff is a young man who was wrongfully expelled from STEM School for attempting to cope with trauma induced by being present at the May 7, 2019, STEM School shooting. Instead of attempting to help this student, STEM School punished him for doing nothing,"" Doe's lawyers argued in court.

Doe protested his discipline to the school district's board of education and then to a judge in state court, arguing there was no documentation of a hitlist. But a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals found sufficient evidence existed to justify the district's concerns about Doe.

""Even if the actual hit list was never presented to the Board, numerous student statements alleging its existence were,"" wrote Judge W. Eric Kuhn in the Oct. 6 opinion. ""And the other evidence before the Board — student statements, Discord screenshots, and Doe’s Discord transcript — support the Board’s conclusion that Doe posted school-shooter-themed profile pictures, usernames, memes, links and jokes.""

In the school district's narrative, Doe posted content in various Discord chatrooms in March 2020, including jokes about school shootings plus a picture of a guitar case and gun with the caption ""school shooter starter kit."" Doe also changed his username to ""the guitar case guy,"" ""showingmyguntoaguitarcase"" and ""Devon the Racist"" — references to his school's 2019 shooting, where the perpetrators brought a gun inside using a guitar case. Devon Erickson was later convicted of Castillo's murder.

Doe also allegedly shared a file in a chatroom with a hit list of STEM school students and staff, singling out ""6th graders,"" ""blacks"" and ""homosexuals."" Simultaneously, he played the song ""Pumped Up Kicks,"" whose subject matter is school shootings. He deleted the document before he left the online chatroom.

Another student who witnessed the posts made an anonymous report to the Douglas County Sheriff's Office. The school district interviewed other students who were present and they corroborated the allegations, including about the hit list. The school found Doe's actions merited expulsion under Colorado law, which authorizes such punishments for behavior on or off school property that ""creates a threat of physical harm"" to other children.

Featured Local Savings

Doe's parents requested a hearing, during which a hearing officer saw evidence of Doe's allegedly threatening and racist posts. The hearing officer recommended a one-year expulsion and the district's superintendent adopted the sanction.

The elected school board affirmed that decision in September 2020 and, when Doe's parents filed a petition in court, Jefferson County District Court Judge Ann Gail Meinster found the evidence reasonably supported Doe's expulsion.

""The district has an obligation,"" Meinster wrote last year, ""to maintain the safety of all students. The record presented shows adequate concerns for the school board to assert their responsibilities.""

Doe then appealed to the Court of Appeals. He argued that, in addition to his auditory processing disorder, he also had autism spectrum disorder that Douglas County School District refused to diagnose in a proper or timely fashion. Because state law prohibits expulsion for students when their actions are a manifestation of their disability, Doe believed the district wrongly denied him that opportunity.

""The statute does not require a student to have an identified disability, but just a disability. In this matter, John had autism spectrum disorder, diagnosed or otherwise, at the time of the alleged incident,"" his lawyers wrote.

They also denied the existence of the hit list.

The Court of Appeals panel believed the evidence was sufficient to expel Doe, and waved aside Doe's claims about autism spectrum disorder. The school board had no evidence suggesting Doe had the condition. It even gave Doe the opportunity to present evidence that was unavailable during earlier proceedings, but Doe still did mention an autism diagnosis, Kuhn noted in the opinion.

The panel denied all of Doe's claims, including his challenge to the constitutionality of the state law allowing for expulsion in response to a student's off-campus speech. Because Doe raised the issue for the first time before the appellate court, the panel declined to consider it.",Q4
https://www.prokerala.com/news/articles/a1377225.html,SIA chargesheets dreaded terrorist who infiltrated BJP ranks in J&K,"Srinagar, Dec 31: In a major blow to the terror ecosystem in Jammu and Kashmir, the State Investigation Agency (SIA) of the J&K Police has filed a chargesheet in a special court against four members of the terror group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) who were reviving militancy in the Union Territorys Jammu province.

Ahmed Ali Fayyaz Srinagar, Dec 31: In a major blow to the terror ecosystem in Jammu and Kashmir, the State Investigation Agency (SIA) of the J&K Police has filed a chargesheet in a special court against four members of the terror group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) who were reviving militancy in the Union Territorys Jammu province.

Those figuring in the chargesheet include Talib Hussain Shah, arrested and involved in a number of grenade and IED blasts. Shah had succeeded in infiltrating the Minority Morcha of the BJP where he had been appointed as in charge of information technology and social media cell in the Jammu division. He also worked as a news anchor on a web portal for some time but went into hiding after two blasts in Rajouri in March and April 2022 in which four persons sustained injuries.

Shah had gained access to senior BJP leaders in Jammu and was at least once spotted among the visitors of a senior BJP leader and a Union Minister in New Delhi. He became a suspect only after he disappeared in Rajouri in May 2022.

Shah was declared as an absconder and he was overpowered by some villagers along with Faisal in a remote village of Reasi district on 27 June 2022. Two AK rifles, one pistol, seven grenades, and a quantity of ammunition were recovered from them.

Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha announced a cash reward of Rs 5 lakh for the villagers who captured Shah and his associate.

According to official sources, Shah aka Abu Ahmad of Draj in Jammu's Rajouri district had recruited a number of youths to revive the terror ecosystem in different districts of the Jammu region before he went underground and was dramatically captured by some civilians in adjoining Reasi district early this year.

The charge sheet was filed against Shah and his three associates in a special court for their involvement in terror activities at the behest of their Pakistan-based handlers, the SIA said in a statement.

The investigation has also established that on the directions of Pakistan-based handlers, Shah had recruited many youths of Jammu and Kashmir and had revived the terror ecosystem in Chenab Valley and Pir Panjal areas of the Jammu region.

""Investigation also proved that the accused persons are also involved in minority killings and creating fear psychosis among the general masses. They have been directed to carry out attacks on security forces and vital installations to meet the objective of secession of J&K from the Union of India,"" the statement added.

The investigation has revealed that Shah was involved in five major incidents of drone dropping collection in which he received arms, ammunition, explosives and Indian currency from Pakistan. He planned and executed a number of grenade and IED attacks in the Pir Panjal mountain range which divides the Kashmir and Jammu provinces.

Shah allegedly received two groups of terrorists who were transported from Kashmir to Rajouri by his associate Mohammad Shabir S/O Ghulam Hussain R/O Draj. With the arrest of Shah and Faisal, the J&K Police claimed to have solved five major terror-related cases including a murder case in Targain, a blast in Kotranka, firing on one Ranjeet Singh besides grenade attacks in Anus jhuggi and Shahpur.

Shah's terror module was also allegedly involved in the grenade attack at the house of the BJP worker Jasbir Singh of Khandli on 12 August 2021. A two-year-old Veer Singh had died in the blast. According to Police, Shah had carried out this attack on the instructions of Pak-based handler Mohammad Qasim aka Suleiman a resident of Angrala, Mahore, PoK.

https://www.fox17online.com/news/local-news/michigan-women-fight-to-preserve-abortion-1-chat-at-a-time,"Michigan women fight to preserve abortion, 1 chat at a time","UTICA, Mich. (AP) — At a wine bar in suburban Detroit, about a dozen women strategized about how to preserve the right to abortion in their state.

This was not a typical political event; there were no microphones, no literature to hand out and few who would consider themselves activists. Among them was a mother of four whose only previous political experience was pushing for later school start times, a busy medical student and a retired teacher who, at 75, has never felt comfortable knocking on doors or cold calling for a candidate.

“But I feel strongly about abortion,” said Mary Ann Messano-Gadula. “Women should be able to take care of their own bodies.""

Messano-Gadula, who attended the late September “Vino the Vote” event with two friends, described herself as the most shy of the bunch. But she said she planned to do what organizers asked of attendees — post some Facebook messages and text some friends to try to get them to support an amendment to the state constitution guaranteeing abortion rights.

“I'm going to give it a shot,"" she said.

Across Michigan this year, similar, more intimate events are playing out alongside the larger, traditional get-out-the-vote efforts, with major stakes for both abortion rights and the candidates — mostly Democrats — who support them.

Michigan is one of a handful of places where abortion rights will be on the ballot in November, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June and left the issue to states to decide. A ban approved in 1931 was suspended, then struck down by state court rulings, but it is no guarantee that the procedure won't one day be outlawed.

That has mobilized people in Michigan, as it has done in previous elections this cycle, including in Kansas and New York. And it could have major implications beyond the state.

Michigan is one of the country's most competitive presidential battlegrounds. It was also among the states where former President Donald Trump and his allies tried to overturn his 2020 loss to Joe Biden, falsely claiming the election was stolen. Voters this fall also will decide statewide offices, including governor and secretary of state, who will be in place for the 2024 election.

The race for governor already has centered around abortion. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer filed a lawsuit prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling seeking to overturn the 1931 ban and said she ""will continue using every tool in my toolbox to fight like hell for women and health care providers.” Republican Tudor Dixon, who opposes abortion except to save the life of the mother, has criticized Whitmer for supporting abortion without limits, and suggested voters who support the constitutional amendment could vote in favor of it and still support her campaign for governor.

The issue already has generated intense interest among voters and pushback from Republicans and abortion opponents. Reproductive Freedom for All, the coalition supporting the abortion-rights amendment, collected over 750,000 signatures on petitions to put the question on the ballot — more than any other ballot initiative in Michigan history.

Opponents turned out in force for a meeting of the Board of State Canvassers, the once-staid panel that decides what questions and candidates qualify for the ballot. With anti-abortion protesters outside the building audible inside the hearing room, the board split along party lines, with two Republicans voting no and two Democrats voting yes. That meant the measure didn't qualify for the ballot, but Reproductive Freedom for All appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court, where justices — a majority of whom were appointed by Democrats — ordered it be put on.

Red, Wine & Blue, the organization that held the wine bar gathering, is among the members of the RFFA coalition in Michigan. Their strategy is to ask suburban women — a key swing demographic in recent elections — to reach out to and talk with friends, family members and other acquaintances and ask them to vote.

The model, known as relational organizing, was used successfully by candidates such as Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia, who won a runoff election to help Democrats win control of the U.S. Senate, and Pete Buttigieg, who went from little-known mayor of South Bend, Indiana, to a top candidate for the party's 2020 presidential nomination.

Greta Carnes, who led the effort for Buttigieg's campaign, said it is particularly effective in turning out suburban women and on the often sensitive and personal issue of abortion. The approach is also more efficient and effective, because people can contact dozens of people in a matter of minutes via text, and a voter receiving a message from someone they know is more likely to read and consider, rather than delete it.

“Especially on an issue like abortion, we can't just have activists” knocking on doors, Carnes said.

Lakshmi Vadlamudi, a medical student from Franklin, Michigan, saw firsthand the power of using her personal network when she helped gather signatures to put the abortion question on the ballot this summer. She told a few friends she would be in a parking lot one day collecting signatures, and word spread like wildfire, she said.

Vadlamudi started getting text messages from people wanting her to come to their house so they could sign. Her Indian “aunties” — women with whom she is close but not related — wanted to circulate their own petitions. Some had family members in the medical profession and feared legal repercussions of performing an abortion if the 1931 ban takes effect, while others worried for their daughters or granddaughters. They ended up with 20 filled petitions.

“We got as many as we could get our hands on,” Vadlamudi recalled. “People kept asking,” she said, and interest in the issue hasn't stopped.

Red, Wine & Blue's Michigan group is aiming to reach 157,000 voters in the state through these “relational” contacts, according to Katie Paris, the organization's national director. The group's leader in Michigan, Kelly Dillaha, said they are recruiting 5,000 women to contact their networks and report back to the group on their progress via an app.

Kathy Nitz, a mother of four from Rochester Hills, started working with Red, Wine & Blue after volunteering at her kids' schools, leading the PTA and spearheading an effort to start schools later in the morning. Those issues always felt like “safe” topics, she said. Talking about abortion, on the other hand, was a bit like saying the word “Voldemort” — the name that characters in the “Harry Potter” books fear would bring great danger if uttered.

But Nitz has grown more comfortable with the topic, even discussing the nuances with her very Catholic and anti-abortion mother. And she believes these small conversations among women like herself could add up.

“What I’ve come to realize as a suburban woman and mother myself is that we’re undervalued. We are underappreciated and under estimated, but we’re also strong,” Nitz said. ""We build communities, we make networks. That’s what we’ve always done.""",Q4
https://www.wfae.org/united-states-world/2022-10-30/cinemas-have-reopened-in-kashmir-after-2-decades-but-few-moviegoers-are-showing-up,Cinemas have reopened in Kashmir after 2 decades — but few moviegoers are showing up,"SRINAGAR, India — Huge movie posters showing muscle-bound Indian action stars adorn the newly built Myoun INOX Cinema multiplex in southern Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir's largest city.

Inside the four-story building, young Kashmiris grab buckets of popcorn before taking their seats to watch Vikram Vedha, a new Hindi-language cop-vs.-gangster action film.

The big-budget movie is a hit across India. But in Indian-administered Kashmir, Oct. 1 marked the first time a film was screened in a cinema in 22 years. And on opening day, only a few dozen moviegoers have shown up.

Among them is Ummi Kulsoom Gulzar, 32, whose uncle used to take her to the movies in the city when she was a child.

/ Showkat Nanda for NPR / Showkat Nanda for NPR Poeple watch Vikram Vedha at Myoun INOX Cinema in Srinagar Oct. 1.

""I brought my 5-year-old niece today,"" she says with a smile. ""To keep the legacy going.""

But there is nothing ordinary about going to the cinema in Indian-administered Kashmir. Just to reach the cineplex, people need to pass through a police checkpoint manned with heavily armed officers. Then they are then frisked at the theater entrance for bombs and weapons. Only those who've bought tickets online ahead of time are allowed in.

Although Kashmir — famed for its idyllic scenery, snow-capped peaks and lakes — was a popular setting for Bollywood movies, cinemas here have been on the front line of an insurgency that has inflicted pain on this Himalayan region for decades.

/ Showkat Nanda for NPR / Showkat Nanda for NPR Students from the National Institute of Technology Srinagar talk to a security guard as they wait to enter the newly opened multiplex in Srinagar on Oct 1.

Now, after decades of unrest, the Indian government is claiming that it has restored calm in Kashmir. Supporters say reopening cinemas — three so far, with seven total planned — is one way to show that. But government critics dismiss the move as little more than a propaganda stunt.

The region has a long and troubled past. Since India and Pakistan gained independence in 1947, they've fought three wars over Kashmir. India currently controls about two-thirds of the region; Pakistan, the rest. The nuclear-armed neighbors still disagree over its boundaries.

For the past three decades, an armed insurgency claimed tens of thousands of lives as it fought India's rule. New Delhi blames Pakistan for backing separatist militants — an accusation Islamabad denies. Some of the separatists want an independent territory; others want to become part of Pakistan.

Vijay Dhar, 81, a co-owner of the new Srinigar multiplex, has lived through the years of violence. His family has owned movie theaters here since the 1960s.

But in 1989, militants declared all cinemas un-Islamic, ordered them shut — and attacked ones that stayed open.

""We had a bomb blast in the theater,"" he says of one of his family-owned properties. ""They burned it.""

In 1999, his family reopened that theater but later had to shut it due to the lack of audience.

Kashmir used to have about 15 movie theaters — all of them were forced to close their doors. Some of them became malls; others became hospitals. Many are still heaps of bricks — blown up by the militants.

For 70 years, until 2019, Indian-administered Kashmir held a special status. A clause in India's constitution gave the region autonomy. But in 2019, the Indian government ended that autonomy. It flooded the region with more troops than ever before and cut off the internet.

Now, three years later, the troops are still there. The mood in Srinagar remains tense, and many residents — who do not want to be named for fear of governmental reprisals — say that things are far from normal.

Documentary filmmaker Sanjay Kak, whose 2007 film examined militancy and state repression in Kashmir, says civil society has been crushed and the opening of the new cineplex is an effort by New Delhi to portray to the world that all is normal in Kashmir.

The government helped cinema owners open up again, by issuing permissions and providing them with security. The multiplex was inaugurated by the administrative head of Jammu and Kashmir.

""There is something slightly bizarre about all this attention being focused on a commercial multiplex in a place which is riven by violence,"" Kak says.

/ Showkat Nanda for NPR / Showkat Nanda for NPR Moviegoers in the Myoun INOX Cinema lobby on Oct. 1.

Srinagar's main mosque, the Jamia Masjid, had been shut for over a year, Kak says. In such a situation, with restrictions in a Muslim-majority region on praying in a mosque, he says, the cinema ""cannot be seen as having any significance in the life of the people of Srinagar or of Kashmir in general.""

One of the biggest challenges facing the owners will be drawing audiences to keep the business going. The new cineplex plans to show three films a week in its three movie halls. Across India, movie houses face stiff competition from home viewing, especially since the pandemic began.

""I'm [a] movie buff and this business is something I am doing from the heart,"" says Dhar. ""If it works, it works.""

Also this week, an analysis by ProPublica , the Texas Tribune and the Washington Post found that a chaotic, fractured medical response to the Robb Elementary School shooting further delayed care for victims in May.

On Wednesday, the leaders of the Southwest Texas Regional Advisory Council, the organization charged with coordinating regional emergency healthcare in southwest Texas, defended the medical response.

A teenage gunman killed 21 people that day, including 19 young children.

Interim Superintendent Gary Patterson, discussing the school security report, explained that there ""was access gained on one exterior door at a campus that was in a cafeteria loading dock area,”

The auditor randomly attempted to gain access to three of the district’s schools over a two-day period. The attempt was successful at one of the schools. Patterson said all of the doors were locked, but the latch of the door opened for the cafeteria delivery was faulty. The loading dock is not in a fenced-in area.

The auditor was stopped by staff in the cafeteria, which did not have students at the time. Patterson said staff will receive additional security training before the school restarts in January.

The school safety report also included an update on campus safety improvements.

Patterson said material issues have caused delays in the installation of security barriers and replacement doors. “The high school and the junior high school have zero percent completion because we are still waiting on those doors,” he said.

Safety improvements including door replacements, fencing and security cameras are being paid in part through $4.9 million in grants. The district also said it expects to continue interviews to fill campus police positions after the holidays.

Eva Mireles deserved better! They all did! Over 375 officers and she was the only one who put those kids lives before her own. — Angel Garza (@AngelG0510) December 20, 2022

Deadly delays

The news analysis of video footage and other records from the day of the shooting concluded that two of the three victims who died after being rescued had critical delays in access to medical care.

It took 16 minutes to locate an ambulance for teacher Eva Mireles, even though two were parked just around the corner. She died without ever leaving the school.

Medics called for a helicopter to airlift 10-year-old Xavier Lopez to a hospital but opted to drive him instead when a chopper wasn’t immediately available.

Families of the victims responded on social media with sorrow and continued calls for accountability.

Mom I’m so sorry this happened https://t.co/M0GKAjXujs — Adalynn ✞💛 (@addy_celeste) December 20, 2022

Law enforcement vehicles and school buses blocked ambulances from accessing the school. And medical helicopters were told to wait at an airport three miles away.

Experts told the news outlets the biggest barrier to timely access to medical treatment was the long delay in confronting the gunman. But they said the fractured medical response also worsened their chances of survival.

State Sen. Roland Gutierrez, who represents Uvalde, said in a statement that the Texas Department of Public Safety should take responsibility.

“In a few weeks, the Texas State Legislature will convene for the first time since the massacre at Robb Elementary,"" the Democrat said. ""I pray my colleagues will join us to hold DPS accountable, take common-sense steps to stop gun violence, and do right by Uvalde families.”

On Wednesday, the leaders of the Southwest Texas Regional Advisory Council, the organization charged with coordinating regional emergency healthcare in southwest Texas, defended the medical response to the Robb Elementary shooting in an open letter to the medical providers they coordinate.

The open letter obtained by KSAT said the news analysis had a “negative slant.”

“Given the challenges of the scene, the decisions and care provided by our medical team members in Uvalde was admirable,” STRAC CEO Eric Epley said.

Epley said Uvalde EMS had medic units on scene in less than three minutes, and some patients initially transported by ambulance met air teams at designated locations for transport to hospitals.",Q4

An American veteran and father of five died on Tuesday after sustaining injuries fighting alongside Ukrainian forces in the east of the country, his sister told CNN.

Dane Partridge, 34, from Rexburg, Idaho, had been fighting in Ukraine since the end of April, his sister Jenny Corry said.

Partridge and the other men he was with were clearing trenches when they were ambushed by two Russian vehicles, Corry said. The men were caught in a firefight. Partridge received shrapnel in his brain and suffered from a broken neck and injured arm, Corry said.

Partridge was taken to a hospital in Zaporizhzhia on October 3. He laid in a coma for eight days and passed away on Tuesday while he was still on life support, Corry said.

Earlier on Thursday, a State Department spokesperson confirmed that a US citizen recently died in the Donbas region of Ukraine but they did not confirm their identity.

Partridge was a volunteer fighting alongside Ukrainian forces, Corry said.

“He had a spiritual conviction to just go. He did not have a plan aside from putting on his backpack and showing up in Poland and figuring it out from there,” Corry said.

Once he arrived in Ukraine, he joined the international legion of foreign fighters, a group of volunteers from countries around the world fighting alongside Ukrainians, Corry said. Partridge was also involved with an organization called LEGS, Logistical Emergencies Getting Solved, helping to organize rescues of injured civilians in Ukraine, Corry said.

Corry said she was frequently in touch with Partridge in the months he was fighting in Ukraine.

“He said it was something that he’d never encountered before,” Corry said of Partridge’s descriptions of his time in Ukraine. “It was more than what he had personally experienced in Baghdad.”

Partridge’s sister said he is a veteran and served in the US Army from 2006-2012. He deployed to Baghdad for Operation Iraqi Freedom for 15 months from 2007 to 2009. The US Army confirmed Partridge did serve during that time with one deployment to Iraq, according to US Army spokesperson Matt Leonard. He held the rank of private first class at the end of his service, Leonard said.

Corry described Partridge’s feeling that he “just needed to serve” in Ukraine.

“He needed to be always working in a job that would allow him to serve his fellow men, and that’s how he lived, and that’s how he died,” Corry said. “He thought he was fighting for a noble cause.”

Partridge’s body will be returned to the US, Corry said. It is currently in transit back from Ukraine, she added. The family plans to bury Partridge in a Veterans Affairs cemetery in Idaho, she said.

Four other Americans are known to have been killed in the country fighting alongside Ukrainian forces during the ongoing conflict with Russia. Willy Joseph Cancel, 22, was killed on April 25, his mother Rebecca Cabrera told CNN.

US citizen Stephen Zabielski died in mid-May, the State Department confirmed, and two other Americans died in the Donbas region in July, the State Department said. One of them was Luke Lucyszyn, his mother Kathy Lucyszyn told CNN.

Raddatz traveled to the southern border to see the Biden border crisis with the governor. That’s more than the president or the vice-president (the border czar) have done. Abbott said that if Title 42 ends on Wednesday, as it is scheduled to do, he anticipates catastrophe along the southern border. “If the courts do not intervene and put a halt to the removal of Title 42, it’s gonna be total chaos.”

There are interesting points that media people like Raddatz are making in the discussion about the lifting of Title 42. By interesting, I mean gaslighting. Raddatz described Title 42 as a Trump policy and she said that the only people she hears calling the border open and accepting of illegal immigrants are people like Governors Abbott and DeSantis. Both points are a little too cute by half.

As far as Title 42 being a Trump policy goes, that’s false. It is a public health policy that the CDC recommended that the former president put into effect to mitigate the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. Yes, Trump was the president at that time but it wasn’t a policy created by his administration, which is the implication when a television host labels the policy as a Trump policy.

From a transcript released by ABC News on Sunday: (emphasis mine)

RADDATZ: We joined Governor Greg Abbott of Texas as he surveyed the border this week. One of the Republican governors fighting to keep Title 42 in place, that Trump policy implemented at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic which allows the U.S. Government to immediately expel most migrants as a public health risk. Since March of 2020, it’s been used nearly 2.5 million times.

Words matter and while this may seem like nitpicking, it is how the debate is framed to convince the public that it must be something that should be halted because the bad Orange Man put it into effect. The fact is that while Biden and his administration give lip service to ending Title 42, they have only recently set about seriously doing that. They never fully enforced the policy but they didn’t end it, either.

Raddatz asked why GOP-governed states are legally challenging the end of Title 42, since the pandemic is supposed to be over. Abbott said that may be true but Title 42 is useful during times like this when there are millions of illegal immigrants trying to cross the border without proper screening or vetting. The ACLU notes that Title 42 hinders asylum-seekers at the border.

Raddatz pressed Abbott on how to justify keeping Title 42 in place when it is a public health order, not official immigration policy. “Whether it’s COVID or some other issue, when you have people coming in from across the globe, without knowing at all what their health status is, that almost by definition is a public health risk,” Abbott responded. “There’s every reason to keep that in place.” But immigration advocates and those fighting to repeal Title 42 have questioned the GOP states’ motive for wanting to keep the policy in place. “They have been fighting to end COVID restrictions everywhere since the beginning. And now all of a sudden, they want a public health restriction solely when it comes to asylum-seekers. I think the real game here is that they’re trying to close the border,” said Lee Gelernt, the lead attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union’s challenge to Title 42, in a statement.

A particularly galling assertion by the likes of Raddatz is that the people really encouraging illegal immigrants to cross the border are people who are criticizing the administration’s lack of action to close the border, including Governors Abbott and Ron DeSantis. That takes cojones. Abbott reminded her that Biden campaigned on doing away with all of the policies and agreements in place that the previous administration used to secure the border. He did just that on his very first day in office.

The Biden administration insists they’ve been preparing for the end of Title 42, pointing to the hiring of more Border Patrol staff and contractors. Biden officials are also pushing back on claims from Abbott and other Republican officials that the end of Title 42 equates to an open border. “I don’t think I’ve ever heard President Biden say, ‘We have an open border, come on over,'” Raddatz said. “The people I have heard say it are you, are former President Trump, are Ron DeSantis. That message reverberates in Mexico and beyond. So they do get the message that it is an open border and smugglers use all those kinds of statements.” Abbott argued that malicious actors have seized on Biden’s border policies since he became president. “It was known from the time that Joe Biden got elected that Joe Biden supported open borders,” Abbott said. “It is known by the cartels, they have sophisticated information. Whether or not the Biden administration is going to enforce the immigration laws or not is known across the world but most importantly, known among the cartels.”

It’s amazing how it is Republicans who are to blame for the Biden border crisis, though Democrats have been in charge of everything for the past two years. The legacy networks are happy to cover for Biden and point fingers in the direction of Republicans. Of course Greg Abbott is speaking out about the border, Texas is a border state that shares 1200 miles of border with Mexico. He and other border state governors have been left to deal with the crisis and chaos on the border since it began. As I said, Joe Biden hasn’t even bothered to make the trip and see for himself what is going on. He doesn’t care. The Biden border crisis is intentional and it is a dereliction of duty. The media doesn’t care, either, and they continue to cover for his administration.",Q4

STOCKTON, Calif. — There is growing concern across the city of Stockton after a series of killings could possibly be linked to a single person.

Stockton Police Department has described a disturbing pattern of killings happening in a few mile radius in central Stockton. All of the victims were men and were gunned down while walking alone in dimly lit areas with no cameras.

Police say the pattern resembles that of a serial killer, sending concern across the city.

Despite the news, 80-year-old Eleanor, of Stockton, still walks her neighborhood regularly. She lives near where the first incident unfolded in July along Kermit Lane.

“I’ve been doing it for years and so I’m familiar with the neighborhood and the people,” Eleanor said, who asked ABC10 not to use her last name. “There’s more focus on it, and I will have to be more careful.”

Between July and September this year, Stockton police have identified five killings that might be connected to the same suspect.

The victims are all men ranging in ages from 21 to 54 and all but one are Hispanic. Police say some were in cars, walking or asleep but all were alone.

The Department released a single image of a person of interest with a tall slender build who was identified near two of the crime scenes.

""We're all taking this hard because of how much he meant to us in our lives,"" Pia Lopez, sister of one of the victims.

Pia Lopez is the sister of Lorenzo Lopez, who was killed before sunrise Tuesday. It was the latest attack that Stockton police believes to be connected.

""By definition, we can very well call this a serial killing, but at this time, we don't know if it's one person or two or three,"" said Police Chief Stanley McFadden.

Sandra, a Kermit Lane resident, said violence has hit their area before. Her home was even marked by a single stray bullet in her garage window.

“Everything is locked up tight as a drum, you know? We have an alarm, we have many precautions that we take,” Sandra said.

However, she says her neighbors look out for one another, and her family takes precautions. She also says feels safe in faith and prayer.

“I feel confident we’re pretty well secured in our homes,” Sandra said.

Police are offering $85,000 for information leading to an arrest. Meanwhile, authorities say detectives are working around the clock on the case.",Q4
https://torrentfreak.com/filmmakers-win-4-2m-piracy-damages-from-defunct-vpn-hosting-company-221108/,Filmmakers Win $4.2m Piracy Damages from Defunct VPN Hosting Company * TorrentFreak,"A group of filmmakers has won over $4.2 million in damages from the defunct hosting company MICFO. The order is tied to a default judgment that finds the company liable for contributory copyright infringement through its VPN customers. It also opens the door to follow-up liability claims against these VPN providers.

Copyright holders have tried a wide variety of options to tackle online piracy over the years, including through direct legal action

More recently we have seen lawsuits against people who allegedly downloaded and shared pirated content, but operators and developers of pirate services have also been sued.

A group of US-based independent movie companies has expanded its legal reach by going after third-party intermediaries. The makers of movies such as “Hellboy,” “Hunter Killer,” “Rambo V: Last Blood,” and “The Hitman’s Bodyguard” have taken aim at VPN services and their hosting companies.

This legal campaign has already returned several successes. Earlier this year, the filmmakers won $14 million in damages in their case against VPN provider LiquidVPN. Other companies including Torguard, VPN Unlimited and VPN.ht settled their disputes and agreed to block torrent traffic on U.S. servers.

Hosting companies haven’t been spared either. Sharktech, for example, initially fought back but later agreed to settle and block prominent pirate sites including ‘Pirate Bay,’ ‘YTS’, and ‘RARBG’.

$4.2 Million in Damages

Last week, another victory was added to the list. At a federal court in Colorado, United States District Judge R. Brooke Jackson issued a judgment against the defunct hosting company MICFO, awarding $4,200,000 in statutory damages for contributory copyright infringement.

The judgment is a clear win for movie company Millennium and its affiliates. For MICFO, which is no longer operational, it only adds to its troubles.

In addition to this civil lawsuit, MICFO finds itself at the center of a criminal case. The hosting company and its owner were indicted by a grand jury in Charleston, South Carolina in 2019, and stand accused of a scheme to fraudulently obtain IP addresses from ARIN.

These IP-addresses were sold to major companies such as Amazon and Saudi Telecom for millions of dollars. MICFO also used the IP-addresses to serve its own clients, which included VPN companies Hide My Ass, NordVPN and Proton.

Ignored Piracy Notices

The filmmakers accused the hosting company of turning a blind eye to piracy activities allegedly committed by the subscribers of its VPN clients. In practice, this meant that it didn’t forward any of the piracy notifications that were sent.

“Defendant failed to take any action against these customers in response to the Notices because it was motivated to receive subscription funds from the customers rather than terminate service,” Judge Jackson writes in his order.

MICFO was held liable for copyright infringement through a default judgment and after an evidentiary hearing, the court ruled that maximum statutory damages of $150,000 per work is appropriate here. With 28 movies at play, this brings the total to $4,200,000.

This damages award is “more than reasonable,” Judge Jackson argues, as the movie companies calculated that the actual damage they suffered is much higher.

“The Court finds Plaintiffs’ request for maximum statutory damages of $4,200,000 more than reasonable in view of Plaintiffs’ lost revenue of nearly $7,000,000..,” the order reads.

Open Ends

MICFO is no longer operational. The company and its CEO pleaded guilty in the criminal wire fraud case and will be sentenced soon. Interestingly, that appears to be good news for the filmmakers, as the US Government seized close to $17 million in funds and assets in that case.

Part of the seized assets could be used to pay the damages award. And indeed, Judge Jackson’s order clarifies that the Plaintiffs may execute judgment immediately to claim restitution from the District Court in South Carolina.

The filmmakers are also assigned any third-party contract breach claims the hosting company has against its clients. This includes any claims against the VPN companies it served.

MICFO’s terms of service required its customers to indemnify the hosting provider in the event of liability claims. This means that the filmmakers can use this as a stick to go after the hosting company’s VPN clients.

More Legal Action

Over the past several years, Millennium Funding and affiliated film companies have established a record of obtaining leverage in court, which can then be used for related matters, both in and outside of court. It wouldn’t be a major surprise to see this pattern repeat.

The only active VPN case that we’re aware of is against VPN provider PIA, which recently defeated the direct infringement claims through a motion to dismiss. The contributory and vicarious copyright infringement claims remain, however.

Following the partial dismissal, the filmmakers filed an amended complaint against PIA and the case is still ongoing.

Department of the Interior

Washington, D.C.

11:57 A.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT: Hello, hello! (Applause.) Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Please, take a seat if you have one. I say that because one day I said, ""Take a seat,"" and everybody said, ""He doesn't even understand there's no chairs out here."" (Laughter.)

Well, Deb — thank you, Madam Secretary, for that introduction. Thirty-five generations of ancestors in New Mexico and the first Native American Cabinet Secretary in American history. (Applause.)

Deb, I want to thank you for your leadership in the Interior Department and the stewardship of the nation-to-nation relationships that I say to my fellow leaders out there. And I mean that sincerely.

To all the Tribal leaders: Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you for being here and for your partnership.

I made a commitment when I ran for President. As a matter of fact, I made a commitment when I was basically a 30-year-old senator and a student of Danny Inouye, the senator from the state of Hawaii, who made it clear to me — because I said ""Indian Country."" He said, ""No, Indian nations."" Indian nations. You know, I — I made a commitment that my administration would prioritize and respect nation-to-nation relationships. And I'm — I'm going to make sure that happens.

I hope our work in the past two years has demonstrated that we're meeting that commitment. And that's why I re-launched this convening and elevated an event into a White House Tribal Nations Summit because — after the previous administration failed to convene any events, anything on this scale.

On my watch, we're ushering in a new era of — and advancing a way for the federal government to work with Tribal nations. And it starts by appointing Native Americans to lead the frontlines of my administration.

You know, starting with Secretary Haaland — Haaland, we — we've followed dozens of Senate-confirmed Native American officials, over 60 Native American appointees all across my administration, including in the federal courts.

I restored the White House Council on Native American Affairs to improve interagency coordination and decision-making.

Together — I emphasize the word ""together"" — together, my entire administration is advancing the economic agenda and making historic investments in Indian Country — and, I might add, that are long overdue.

Facing a pandemic and economic crisis that disproportionately impacted Tribal nations, I invested more than $35- — $32 billion in the American Rescue Plan, the largest one-time-ever direct investment in Indian Country in American history.

During the pandemic, Native Americans were contracting — contracting the virus three times — three times the rate of other groups and losing their lives at twice the rate of other groups.

But together, we used that funding to help Tribal communities go from one of the most — most harmed groups by COVID to one of the most vaccinated communities in the entire country. (Applause.)

And to all my fellow leaders, you used that funding to address other critical needs as well, such as housing, food assistance, support for Tribal economies, and for schools and language.

In fact, last year, Jill, my wife, traveled with Deb to the Cherokee Immersion School in Oklahoma. The Cherokee Nation used part of this funding to start building a second school and revitalize the use of the Cherokee language.

By the way, she spent a lot of time on other reservations — other Nations as well. I'm worried she's not going to come home one of these days — (laughter) — when she goes. You think I'm joking. I'm telling you, if I hear more about the Navajos than I hear about me — (laughter). You all think I'm kidding, don't you?

At any rate, learning Native languages leads to better outcomes in school, it builds confidence in students, and passes down old traditions to new generations. It matters. But it didn't stop there. Together, we're continuing to make a difference.

I also made the largest single investment in our nation's infrastructure since President Eisenhower's national highway program — the biggest investment in Indian Country infrastructure ever in history. More than $13 billion in rebuilding infrastructure in Indian Country. And to state the obvious, it's long overdue.

And we're putting it to work together — building water infrastructure for clean drinking water, safer plumbing systems; delivering affordable, high-speed Internet; repairing roads and bridges; restoring waterways that are now blocked by roads and highways that affect the migration of salmon that's essential to the livelihoods and cultures of so many Tribes; electrifying diesel school buses so Tribal children don't breathe that polluted air generated by diesel engines.

And in South Dakota, $29 million of infrastructure funding to help us repair two old dams built in the '40s, and the other — the first in the '40s, the other in the '60s — on the Pine Ridge Reservation.

For years — for years and years now, the Tribes have lived in the shadow of disaster, worried the dams would break and destroy their communities. So, soon they will be able to sleep a much more peaceful night, knowing those dams have been fully repaired and rebuilt.

This past summer, we also ushered in a new era of confronting and adapting to the climate crisis. I signed a law that made the biggest investment ever — ever in all of history — that includes $700 million exclusively for Native communities.

I see our Secretary of Agriculture here, who has also made it clear and made a major contribution on seeing to it that we use farmlands to absorb carbon from the air and so much more, and pay farmers for doing it.

It's going to help mitigate the impacts of extreme droughts and wildfires and rising sea levels that affect sources of Tribal foods, Tribal resources, Tribal traditions, and Tribal ways of life.

It's going to bring clean electricity into your homes. It's going to develop homegrown clean energy so Indian Country helps lead the future to the goal we've set of 100 percent carbon-pollution-free electricity by the year 2035.

You're all part of that, and you're going to help lead that.

To ensure these investments reach Native lands, my administration is going to work with the Tribes to help them transition to clean energy development and do it quickly. That includes the federal government, as the largest single energy consumer in the world, buying more carbon-free electricity from Tribal energy producers.

We're also going to launch a new electric vehicle initiative for Tribal nations to ensure that our nationwide electric vehicle network includes Native communities. And, as all of you know, there are Tribal communities at risk of being washed away — washed away by superstorms, rising sea levels, and wildfires raging.

I've flown over literally several thousand acres of the storms and the fires set in the West in particular and also down in the Southwest. And it's devastating.

That's why today I'm announced a $135 million commitment to help 11 Tribal communities from Maine, Louisiana, Arizona, Washington State, and Alaska to move, in some cases, their entire communities back to safer ground and pay for that.

I've also requested $9.1 billion — that's with a ""B"" — billion dollars for the Indian Health Services. I've asked Congress, for the first time ever, to make that funding mandatory — (applause) — a mandatory part of the federal budget.

That means the funding would always be there, and it insulates Indian Health Services from budget uncertainties to [that] make it harder to deliver the care Indian Country needs and deserves.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you!

THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank — we got to get it done. I need your help in getting it done.

And here's another thing that's very important to me: In last year's summit, I signed an executive order to improve public safety and the criminal justice for Native Americans, and to respond more effectively to the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous people.

Since then, the United States Departments of Justice and Interior have created a lead, new federal agency enforcement strategy that makes — that takes the special circumstances of these crimes into account.

This is a priority to me and to the Justice Department. And so, it's using the Violence Against Women Act, which I wrote myself 30 years ago — as my — my sister would kid and say, ""with my own paw."" I sat down and wrote that because I feel so strongly about it — to end the scourge of violence against women everywhere.

This year, I was proud to sign a reauthorization of this law that includes historic provisions that strengthen Tribal sovereignty and safety.

And today — (applause) — and today, I'm announcing even more critical actions that are the result of a meaningful and deliberate consultation process with you all. My administration listened, we heard you, and we're implementing many of the changes you asked for.

Today, I signed a new presidential memorandum that improves consultation between the federal government and Tribal nations based on key principles. Consultation has to be a two-way, nation-to-nation exchange of information. (Applause.)

Federal agencies should strive to reach consensus among the Tribes. (Applause.) And there should be adequate time for ample communications.

The federal agencies should prepare a public record for what's transpired during those consultations. And Tribal nations should know how their contributions influenced the decision-making.

And this is a new presidential memorandum requires all relevant federal agencies to get annual training on Tribal consultation process. (Applause.) Let me say that again: all federal agencies. And so, folks, this is a whole changed approach.

My administration will also continue using all the available authorities, including the Antiquities Act, to protect sacred Tribal lands.

Deb was with me — (applause) — Deb was with me last year at the White House when I restored the national monuments at Bears Ears and the Grand Staircase-Escalante in Utah — (applause) — the National Canyons and Seamounts in New England.

And last month, I traveled to Colorado to declare Camp Hale-National Continental Divide the first new national monument in my presidency using the Antiquities Act. Millions of acres. (Applause.)

Look — and there is so much more. There's so much more that we're going to do to protect the treasured Tribal lands.

When it comes to Spirit Mountain and its surrounding ridges and canyons in southern Nevada, I'm committed to protecting this sacred place that is central to the creation story of so many Tribes that are here today. And — (applause).

And I'm grateful to so many of you who have led the fight to protect it. I especially want to thank Nevada's congressional delegation. I know there's a lot going on and — well, I can see a couple here now.

I see — Dina Titus is here. Dina, how are you? Thank you for the support.

Is — is Catherine here — Cortez Masto? She was — she — and Senator Rosen — they both are — there's a little action going on in the United States Senate to try to prevent a gre- — rail strike.

Is Representatives Lee and Horsford here? Well, you got the best of the group here, Dina. She's an old friend and a strong supporter. And I look forward to being able to visit Spirit Mountain and experience it with you as soon as I can.

And, folks, look, I also want to thank Raul, Chairman of House Natural Resources, and — for his leadership across the board on all the efforts I've talked about here today. I'm also announcing that Deb, as Secretary of Interior, will continue to work with the Secretary of Agriculture — as I said, is here — to co-stewardship the federal lands, because that's what it is. (Applause.)

We've already signed over 20 new agreements with Tribes this year, giving them a greater role in the stewardship of federal lands that are important to their cultures. And it's not stopping there. We have 60 additional co-sponso- — co-stewardship agreements currently under review. And I'm announcing today that the Secretary of Commerce is going to formally join these efforts as well.

So, let me close with — (applause) — with a word my dad used all the time: respect. Everyone is entitled to be treated with respect and dignity — the dignity that comes from just being who we are. This is especially true for Tribal nations to whom the United States owes a solemn trust and treaty obligations that we haven't always lived up to.

When I talk about respect, here is what I mean by respect: respect for Tribes as nations and treaties as law.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)

THE PRESIDENT: Respect for — beg your pardon?

AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)

THE PRESIDENT: I thought — I thought you said ""no.""

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you!

THE PRESIDENT: I was — I was getting a little worried. I thought you said — someone said ""no."" (Applause.)

Respect for Indigenous knowledge and Tribal consultations as a key part of the federal agency decision-making. (Applause.)

Respect means we'll defend Tribal sovereignty and self-government and self-determination. And we'll supp- — (applause).

And we'll support Tribal economies and keep fighting for better Tribal healthcare, child care, education, housing, public safety, and so much more.

And respect means being there in person to show it. (Applause.)

You've seen Jill. You've seen my wife, Jill, in Indian Country. She's at a funeral this morning for the mother of a friend of ours. And — but I've spent a lot of — she's spent a lot of time — I've spent a lot of time in Indian Country as a senator and vice president. But I can say here today I intend to make official presidential visits to Indian Country to make it official. (Applause.) Let's do it.

And I will do so in the enduring spirit of our nation-to-nation relationship — the spirit of friendship, stewardship, and respect. It's taken too long for us to recognize this is the only way to move forward, but my administration is doing all it can to demonstrate our commitment to those timeless ideals.

So, thank you. Thank you for being here. Thank you for your leadership. Thank you for your partnership. And I'm sure I'll make mistakes, but you know me. Don't hesitate to correct me when I make them. I know you; you won't hesitate. (Laughter.) But I really mean it.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: You got that right!

THE PRESIDENT: I really mean it. Well, I'll tell you what: No one has ever done as much as President as this administration is doing. Period. Period. (Applause.) I am committed.

And as my grandfather Finnegan would say, ""That's the Irish of it."" Thank you all very much. (Applause.)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Four more years!

THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I don't know about that.

Thanks. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Finally, finally, finally. Let's keep it going, okay? Thank you.

Officers responding to a call found a 14-year-old boy and 16-year-old boy dead shortly after 5 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 17, at an apartment in the 3000 block of Continental Colony Parkway in Atlanta, Deputy Chief Charles Hampton Jr. with the city’s police department said during a news conference posted on Facebook.

Three others, an 11-year-old boy, a 15-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl, were injured and taken to a hospital, Hampton said. Two of them had been shot and one had been grazed by a bullet.

Police are not aware of any other injuries.

Hampton said police learned the shooting stemmed from “some type of dispute on social media.” One group showed up to the apartment with guns and others began firing, he said.

Police did not say how many teenagers were involved.

“Both parties had weapons and right now we have individuals down at headquarters being interviewed by homicide detectives to determine what their involvement is,” Hampton said.

Hampton said the investigation is still “very active” and asked anyone with information to report it to CrimeStoppers.

“I hate being here talking about kids and gunfire,” Hampton said. “Again we just ask parents to know where your kids are, know what they’re doing, check rooms. And again it’s just too many guns in the hands of our youth.”

He called the situation troubling and said police are “here trying to figure out exactly what happened” so that the individuals involved can be held responsible.

“This should be a time that we are getting ready for the holidays but we have at least two families that will be planning for funerals,” Hampton said.

3 law schools dinged for low bar pass rates

Image from Shutterstock.

Updated: On Tuesday, the ABA posted notice that the Ave Maria School of Law, the University of the District of Columbia David A. Clarke School of Law and Vermont Law School are out of compliance with Standard 316, which requires a bar passage rate of at least 75% within a two-year time period.

The most recent bar pass data, which the council of the ABA’s Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar released in April, is based on 2019 graduates. In notices dated Dec. 13, the council asked the three schools to submit reports by Feb. 1. The reports will be considered when the council meets in May.

At the Ave Maria School of Law, its two-year bar pass rate was 67.21% for 2019 graduates and 83.58% for 2018 graduates.

In a statement, the law school described its 2019 bar passage rates as “an anomaly.” Immediate steps were taken to correct that, according to the law school, which claims that its class of 2020 two-year bar passage rate is now at 89.7%. The law school expects the matter to be resolved with the council in February.

At the University of the District of Columbia David A. Clarke School of Law, it law school’s two-year bar pass rate is 67.24% for the class of 2019. The class of 2018 had a 75.38% bar pass rate.

Twinette Johnson, the acting dean of the University of the District of Columbia David A. Clarke School of Law, told the ABA Journal that her school’s 2019 graduates who didn’t pass a bar on their first attempts faced problems in 2020 because of pandemic complications surrounding the tests.

“I believe some of our class of 2019 lost the opportunity to take the bar,” Johnson says.

The law school was also found to be out of compliance with Standard 316 in May 2020. In August 2020, the council determined that the law school had come back into compliance with Standard 316.

For Vermont Law School, 2019 graduates had a 67.54% bar pass rate, compared to 82.84% for 2018 graduates.

“We were surprised and disappointed to learn in the fall of 2019 that our July bar passage had dropped,” the law school said in a statement, which described its class of 2019 bar pass rate as “an anomaly.”

According to the statement, the law school has devoted resources to its academic success program and teaching program and has reviewed admissions policies and procedures.

Earlier this year, the council posted notice that the Western Michigan University Thomas M. Cooley Law School received a two-year extension to come into compliance with Standard 316.

Later in the year, the council gave a three-year extension for bar pass compliance to the Inter American University of Puerto Rico School of Law and the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico School of Law.

https://verticalmag.com/news/sikorsky-to-enter-the-aam-race-with-new-hybrid-electric-vtol/,Sikorsky to enter the AAM race with new hybrid-electric VTOL,"Sikorsky is developing a hybrid-electric VTOL demonstrator vehicle as part of its effort to enter the advanced air mobility (AAM) space — with its Matrix autonomous technology at the heart of the new system, the company told Vertical.

The Sikorsky Autonomy Research Aircraft (SARA) is a reconfigured S-76B that Sikorsky uses for a range of tests and experiments to mature its Matrix technology. Ted Carlson Image

The new system will use a turbine to generate electricity, said Igor Cherepinsky, director of Sikorsky Innovations. The Lockheed Martin subsidiary is on track to begin building the demonstrator aircraft sometime in 2023, he said. It will use the Matrix autonomy system as its core operating system.

The new vehicle will “be our first foray into what the next generation of commercial aircraft will look like,” Cherepinsky said. However, it would have applications across different sectors, with the eventual goal of developing “an electric propulsion system for both commercial and military applications.”

Sikorsky has further developed its Matrix autonomy system over recent years, perhaps most notably through its work with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) — with Matrix a key part of the Aircrew Labor In-cockpit Automation System (ALIAS).

The technology was on display in October 2022 at the U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona through the Project Convergence 2022 (PC22) technology gateway exercise, where DARPA and Sikorsky demonstrated the ability of an autonomous Black Hawk to conduct battlefield logistics missions. Such applications would form the backbone of any offering in the commercial sector as well, Cherepinsky said.

“The crux is that the workload is much lower and the machine understands a lot of the basic flying and basic mission parameters,” he said. “The aircraft can avoid obstacles, and it can pick landing zones. If you think about the commercial space, AAM is also in our sights.”

The company began investing in autonomy before the launch of ALIAS, which began in 2015. The aim has always been to develop the technology for use across the company’s product lines, both military and commercial, Cherepinsky said.

“We do lots of commercial missions today, everything from carrying VIPs to delivering people to oil rigs, cargo, search and rescue and firefighting missions,” he said. “We intend to stay in those mission spaces.”

Sikorsky has several purely commercial customers who are interested in Matrix, one of which is undergoing certification with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. Cherepinsky could not provide further details due to business confidentiality. He said this platform is fixed-wing rather than rotary-wing, although the potential of the technology cuts across both sectors. Matrix is applicable to any helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft, including those made by other companies.

“It is our hope that within the next three to five years, you’re going to see those products in commercial service,” he said.

The company has also worked with other partners beyond the military, including NASA, whose AAM National Campaign has used the Sikorsky Autonomy Research Aircraft (SARA) for research flights.

SARA is a reconfigured S-76B that Sikorsky uses for a range of tests and experiments related to Matrix. NASA and Sikorsky have developed a multi-year partnership to continue the technology as part of NASA’s integration of automated systems (IAS) concept.

Cherepinsky said the focus of the work with NASA is to identify the type of regulations that need to be in place to ensure safe and efficient operations of autonomous vehicles. He said NASA has integrated some of its own software into Matrix, “and we’re flying them on our aircraft to showcase approach procedures, for example — how would a smaller eVTOL or a larger AAM vehicle operate within new vertiports, which obviously would look very different to today’s airports?”

This would also consider the interaction of autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles in dense airspace where they may have to deconflict with one another, as well as deal with obstacles like birds, etc.

The eVTOL sector is a further potential target for Matrix in the coming years, with the technology capable of essentially flying the platforms and “delivering the promise of eVTOL air taxis that are operated by you and me, not pilots,” Cherepinsky said.

There is some distance to go to full certification, but the technology is largely here today, though there remain challenges in areas such as perception — the ability to reliably detect objects, for instance.

“How do you prove that the sensor is able to see something at a given distance? That’s not an easy problem to solve,” he said.",Q4

PORTLAND, Maine — Mary Grove has lived in Cumberland for 23 years. For a portion of that time, her family was dealing with an invisible struggle: substance use disorder in their youngest of two sons.

""When our younger son was in high school, it was very clear that things were starting to unravel for him,"" Grove said.

She said early signs of a problem included the abuse of his Adderall pills, alcohol, and weed during his freshman year of high school. Then during his senior year, the situation took a turn for the worse.

""I think the worst point was when he went in the E.R. one night, and nobody knew anything,"" Grove said.

Coming up on @newscentermaine, I’ll tell you about The Family Restored. It’s a non-profit that addresses substance use disorder by helping the family members and friends of those battling addiction. How it has helped Mainers in different ways at 6 p.m. pic.twitter.com/rY8Yv52lxf — Chloe Teboe (@ChloeTeboe) October 26, 2022

Grove added she and her family struggled to know what to do and how to help him until they heard about The Family Restored through a friend. The nonprofit, based in the Greater Portland area, was founded in 2014 and helps the family members and friends of those battling addiction.

""The meetings are facilitated by addicts in recovery, and each week there’s somebody who’s somewhere in recovery who comes in to speak,"" Grove said.

She said hearing that perspective helped her family learn how to set appropriate boundaries, which eventually helped her son. In 2016, he ended up going into recovery and has been sober now for six years and counting. Grove said without The Family Restored, that journey could have looked entirely different.

""I don’t think we would have understood that what we thought was helping was really hurting him and enabling him,"" Grove said.

Eric Girard is the executive director of The Family Restored. He founded the nonprofit after his own struggles with addiction and knowing how it hurt his loved ones.

""Families often find themselves pretty lost with nowhere to turn and desperate for answers,"" Girard said.

Girard added The Family Restored offers educational workshops and support groups for family members and friends dealing with these complicated situations. It also provides scholarships to people who need and want recovery through donations and fundraising.

""The financial barrier of getting into treatment can be the difference between someone getting well or not or continuing in the cycle of addiction,"" Girard said, noting treatment can be more expensive than people think.

""If you’re seeking more of inpatient treatment [or] a longer stay, [or] if you're attending any kind of insurance-based program, and you don’t have insurance, it could be as much as $10,000 to $20,000,"" Girard said.

So far, The Family Restored has given scholarships to 675 people, totaling about $850,000. That money has helped people like Jacob Desfosses, who got a couple of months of his housing at Portland Sober Living (that The Family Restored operates), paid for through this scholarship.

""Giving people opportunities to settle in sets them up for greater success further along,"" Desfosses said.

He said his decade-long fight with addiction cost him relationships, family, friends, and jobs. He said support from places like The Family Restored has helped him start writing a new chapter.

""I’m in a place I never thought I’d be in now, all because of people who gave me an opportunity and wanted to help out and truly cared,"" Desfosses said.

The Family Restored offers in-person meetings in Falmouth, Portland, and South Portland, and people can also join remotely. You can learn more here.",Q4
https://www.fox29.com/news/chester-sees-dramatic-reduction-in-gun-violence-and-deadly-shootings,Chester sees dramatic reduction in gun violence and deadly shootings,"First Trenton and now Chester is reducing gun violence, and their drop is 60 percent.

City, county, state and federal leaders shared the results of the Chester Partnership for Safe Neighborhoods (CPSN) since it launched in 2020.

There has been a 59.7% decrease in non-fatal shootings since 2019 (87 to 35)

There has been a 60% decrease in gun violence homicides since 2020 (25 to 10)

There has been a 55% decrease in gun violence incidents since 2019 (100 to 45)

CPSN is composed of public agencies, community groups and law enforcement all sharing the common goal of curbing gun violence.

""If you commit a homicide in the City of Chester, we are going to get you. If you fire a gun at somebody in the City of Chester, we are coming for you,"" said Jack Stollsteimer, Delaware County District Attorney.

Chester currently has a 70 percent homicide clearance rate, which is the highest in over 20 years, of murders ending in arrests.

MORE HEADLINES:

DA Stollsteimer said law enforcement is zeroing in on individuals who are most likely to shoot or be shot to prevent crime and offer services.

""Anybody who is actually in law enforcement and who understands what we’re doing here, gets that this is the only proactive strategy there is to actually stop gun violence. They just need to bite the bullet and do it in the City of Philadelphia and that would help the whole regional problem, by the way,"" said Stollsteimer.

Mayor Thaddeus Kirkland said crime prevention and quality of life investments also make a difference, including additional city cameras and bright LED streetlights.

""Our goal is to make sure that no one loses their life to any type of violence in our community,"" said Mayor Kirkland.

The nonprofit Making a Change Group is a stakeholder in CPSN. The founder and executive director Cory Long has been mentoring youth in Chester for nearly 20 years.

""We’re starting to see the fruits of our labor with a safer community and homicide rates down, which for me, is very personal,"" said Long, a Chester native. ""I know these parents, I know the moms, I know some of these kids. With our GVINE, our Gun Violence Intervention Network and Empowerment program, we have credible messengers in specific neighborhoods in the community that are reducing and mitigating violence.""

District Attorney Stollsteimer said after seeing the results in Chester, the gun violence reduction approach will be expanded to other communities in Delaware County including Sharon Hill and Darby Borough.

Last year, city leaders from Philadelphia met with Chester officials to discuss gun violence prevention tactics.

On Wednesday, Philadelphia council members made a similar trip to Trenton where law enforcement, social services and city departments are partnering to effectively reduce gun violence.",Q4

https://apnews.com/article/georgia-savannah-70066494af4b2f7865d0709a92cc622a,"Police: Missing Georgia toddler believed dead, mom a suspect","SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — Police who spent more than a week searching for a toddler who was reported missing from his home have gathered enough evidence to conclude that the boy is dead and name his mother as a suspect in his death and disappearance, the police chief said Thursday.

Authorities are still searching for the body of 20-month-old Quinton Simon, Chatham County police Chief Jeff Hadley said during a news conference. Police consider the boy’s mother, Leilani Simon, a suspect, but Hadley said she hadn’t been charged as of Thursday afternoon.

The toddler’s mother called 911 on the morning of Oct. 5 to report him missing, saying she had last seen her son inside his playpen. Police and volunteers quickly fanned out across the neighborhood just outside Savannah to look for the child, who was described as last seen wearing a Sesame Street T-shirt and black pants.

In the days that followed, police obtained a warrant to search the child’s home with assistance from FBI agents. They drained a pool in the backyard and used search dogs to comb woods near the house.

Hadley declined to specify what led police to believe the boy is dead.

“What I can say is the evidence we have so far based on multiple search warrants and interviews has led us to the conclusion that Quinton is deceased,” the chief said.

He also wouldn’t say why police suspect the boy’s mother, though he said she is currently the only suspect. Asked why police named her as a suspect but hadn’t charged her, Hadley said: “We will only do that when we feel we have everything we need.”

It wasn’t immediately known Thursday if Simon had a lawyer who could speak on her behalf.

Police reports and court documents show there was turmoil in recent weeks between the child’s mother and grandmother, Billie Jo Howell, who had legal custody of him and an older sibling. Quinton, his mother and his mother’s boyfriend lived with Howell.

Simon called police on Sept. 7 following an argument with her mother over laundry in which she said Howell had shoved her against a wall, according to a police report. No one was charged and an officer found no injuries other than Simon’s reddened elbow.

The following day, Quinton’s grandmother filed papers in Chatham County Magistrate Court to have Simon and her boyfriend evicted from her home, WTOC-TV reported.

“Just want them to move out as quick as possible. ... They have damaged my property and at this point no one is living in peace,” the Sept. 8 court document read.

A few weeks later, on Sept. 28, a Superior Court judge ordered Leilani Simon to pay $150 per month in child support.

Quinton’s mother reported him missing a week later.

FBI agent Will Clarke, who supervises the bureau’s office in Savannah, said agents were assisting local police in their search for Quinton within a few hours of him being reported missing. Clarke said the FBI sent a team that specializes in child abductions to help.

Hadley said his officers and the FBI had conducted an “exhaustive” search. He vowed that they won’t stop.

“Sadly, we still have not found Quinton,” Hadley said. “But our search and our investigation will continue, and it will continue with every available resource we have.”",Q4
https://odishatv.in/news/odisha/-do-or-die-this-odisha-ex-army-man-s-call-to-youth-on-vijay-diwas-192504,'Do or Die' - This Odisha ex-Army man's call to youth on Vijay Diwas,"There are numerous veteran Indian Army soldiers in Odisha who fought valiantly in wars. And battle-time anecdotes from them are not any less either. There is one army veteran who has witnessed as many battles from close quarters and was indispensable for the forward soldiers. His mention is rendered important as India celebrates Vijay Diwas, win over Pakistan in 1971, today.

Meet ex-serviceman, Sulabh Behera from Karlapatna village in Kendrapara, who served the Indian Army as a Signals man from 1956 till retirement in almost all the combat operations and wars since 1961. And his call for today’s youth is ‘do or die’.

When OTV caught up with him on Friday, Behera, wearing a big moustache, was gleaming with pride. Vijay Diwas is more of his day, of course! He is a part of the famous win that saw the creation of Bangladesh as an independent nation.

Reminiscing his service days, Behera said, “My first active war was in 1961 Goa operation when Indian Army pushed away the Portuguese from the shores of Goa in a military operation and included the province in India. The second war was in November 1962. It was Deepawali and the Chinese opened fire on us. We even did not have any winterwear to keep us warm at that altitude. Though we lost that fight, we never let that fight get better of us. We ended it in a positive note by killing some Chinese as well.”

“The next war was in 1965 with Pakistan. It was long fought battle spanned from April till December that year. We finally won that war. I fought the most memorable war of my life in 1971. This was against Pakistan as well, but this war wasn’t ours to fight. On humanitarian grounds, we helped liberate the East Pakistan (Now Bangladesh) from the clutches of the inhuman treatment by Pakistan Army,” Behera added.

Asked about his message to the young generation wishing to join the military, Behera said, “Do or die; this is the only motto in Indian Army. This is the only sentence that will keep you motivated to serve Mother India till your last breathe.”

Though Behera was not in the uniform, he did not forget to wear his stars on his chest during the entire interview, displaying his Indian Army heritage with pride.

They also took a swipe at Walker’s 1.7 million votes and wondered “Who are these … people?!” One even said Walker looked happy that he lost.

“I was surprised it was so close though,’ racist Sunny Hostin said before scoffing at Walker’s supporters. “As mentioned, 1.7 million people voted for Herschel Walker. Who are these 1.7 million people?!” she sneered in disgust.

Whoopi Goldberg asserted that all they cared about was winning and Hostin called that “terrible”:

GOLDBERG: People who wanted to win. I mean, remember what we've heard in the past. HOSTIN: Just people who wanted to win?! And that's what's terrible. GOLDBERG: It's just about winning.

Behar agreed and added that they also wanted “power.” She also suggested that Walker looked “relieved” to have lost the race because “these white guys,” like former President Trump and Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), were only interested in “using him.”

Seeing an opportunity to attack “the white guys,” Hostin threw a hissy fit and whined about Republicans calling out Democrats for being obsessed with identity politics, and proposed that it was actually the other way around:

You know, the Republicans are always arguing about identity politics and how Democrats use too much identity politics, and we talk too much about race and we talk too much about the LGBTQ plus community, and it's not about identity politics. They made that race about identity politics. They tried to find a black man because there was another black man running.

She went on to call Walker “the worst, most unqualified, most undignified black man” and found it insulting that he was nominated to go up against “Senator Raphael Warnock who has so much dignity and is actually a pastor at Martin Luther King's former church!” “Like, how dare you think that that is okay,” she decried.

Of course, there was no mention of Warnock evicting his parishioners from their homes owned by the church, nor the allegation from his ex-wife that he ran over her foot with his car.

And to close out her argument that the GOP plays identity politics and not Democrats, she announced that she was registering her disgust “as a black woman.”

A couple of minutes later, Goldberg spouted off again this time building off of Hostin and arguing that Republicans only select women and minority candidates because they can be controlled:

GOLDBERG: You know, we saw them do it when John McCain was running [with Sarah Palin]. They decided, oh, we got to put somebody who can run against -- HOSTIN: “Oh, let's put a woman in there.” GOLDBERG: Yes! “Let’s put a woman.” BEHAR: Oh, Sarah.

Goldberg seemed to agree with Behar’s assertion, saying she was confident Walker “started recognizing that this was not a, ‘oh, we think you can do this.’ This was, ‘you'll do this and we'll tell you what to do.’”

This racist appeal from The View was made possible because of lucrative sponsorships Vicks and Red Lobster. Their contact information is linked.

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, Strain and his restaurant, Pure Wine Cafe, had already weathered two devastating floods that claimed lives and wiped out businesses all along Ellicott City’s historic Main Street.

When the pandemic arrived, “the whole world sort of felt what we had felt in Ellicott City” after the floods, Strain said. “The other side of those things is never the same.”

(Karl Merton Ferron/Baltimore Sun Staff)

Sometimes the only response to change is to evolve. That’s what Strain decided to do with the 13-year-old Pure Wine Cafe, a cozy tapas and wine bar that closed at the end of July to morph into something new.

Pure Wine’s successor, Revel & Main, puts a focus on tacos and tiki drinks like the “Tia Mia,” a blend of white rum, mezcal, orgeat and lime, and the “Blue Hawaiian,” an electric-blue cocktail laced with tropical flavors like pineapple and coconut. There are a half-dozen tacos on the menu for now, including a bulgogi-marinated, braised steak taco topped with pickled veggies, rice and sriracha aioli that’s reminiscent of a Pure Wine favorite.

The restaurant, which opened late last month, reinvigorates the intimate Pure Wine Cafe space with a menu that appeals to post-pandemic Covid tastes.

“Craft cocktails are a huge category right now and will continue to gain traction in the food and beverage world,” Strain says. There’s Instagram-worthiness to consider, too: “Taking a picture of a glass of wine is great, but taking a picture with a colorful cocktail and a great garnish is better,” he said.

Regulars will still find traces of the beloved Main Street wine bar at Revel & Main. The new restaurant maintains a thoughtful wine list, and the taco selection draws inspiration from a weekly Taco Tuesday special at Pure Wine Cafe.

Revel & Main has a half-dozen tacos on the menu for now, including a bulgogi-marinated, braised steak taco topped with pickled veggies, rice and sriracha aioli that’s reminiscent of a Pure Wine favorite. The restaurant also serves appetizers such as truffle fries, birria mac and cheese and a “Maryland elote salad” (read: roasted corn, queso fresco and, of course, Old Bay), as well as a dessert menu with sweets like tres leches bread pudding and creme brulee.

On top of the menu changes, Strain is making tweaks at Revel & Main to fit the post-COVID hiring landscape.

Many of the restaurant’s staff are new to the hospitality business, and Strain has developed his cocktail recipes with easy-to-follow “systems” that help bartenders turn out drinks quickly and consistently. He says he’s building the business with an eye toward expansion.

“Change is hard for everybody; it was hard for me, honestly,” he said of this next phase. “But when you put yourself in the position where you embrace a little bit of fear, good things can come from that.”

Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah says India's involvement in terror activities in Pakistan is highly condemnable and we will take up this issue at the United Nations.

He was addressing a news conference in Islamabad on Tuesday along with Inspector General Counter Terrorism Department Punjab Imran Mehmood.

The Additional IG gave a detailed briefing about the investigation and findings of incident of car bomb blast in Johar Town Lahore last year and proofs of India's involvement in it.

The Interior Minister said Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari will take it up on UN Security Council debate tomorrow.

He said real face of India will be exposed on the basis of these clear evidences.

Rana Sanaullah said in an effort to justify and cover up its brutalities in Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, India hoodwinks international community and perpetrates terrorism in Pakistan.

He said Kulbhushan Jadhav and all his activities are an evidence to corroborate the fact.

The Minister said entire Pakistani nation has rendered matchless sacrifices in war against terrorism alongside security forces and we now need to accelerate our efforts to expose India's real face to extirpate terrorism.

On the occasion, Additional Inspector General CTD Punjab Imran Mehmood briefed the newsmen about the investigation in Johar Town blast in which 3 civilians were killed and 22 including police personnel were injured.

He said the investigation has revealed that India has done terror financing worth 8 lac 75 thousand dollars through RAW agents, who were involved in this terror incident.

The Additional IG said we have identified this whole network of Indian funded terrorists and their facilitators during investigation of the Johar Town bomb blast.

Elucidating the complete detail of terrorists and their facilitators, Imran Mehmood said four of the accused have been convicted and awarded three times death sentence on the basis of concrete evidence while other three's case is sub judice. He added that red warrants had been issued by Interpol of remaining operators and agents.",Q4

by John Boivin

Local Journalism Initiative Reporter, Valley Voice

A little bear that was rescued in New Denver last month died soon after arriving at a wildlife sanctuary in Smithers.

“With sadness we have to share that the New Denver bear has passed away,” announced a Facebook post from the Northern Lights Wildlife Society last week. “We are honoured to have been able to make his last days pain-free, warm and giving him a feeling of being cared for.”

The tiny bear – it was yearling, but weighed only about 40 pounds at capture – was trapped in New Denver on Nov. 27 after hanging around town a few days.

A local resident who watches out for problem bears in the community thought it might be an orphan, whose mother and sibling were killed on the highway north of New Denver during the summer.

The bear was trapped by trained local volunteers, and then shipped to the wildlife society’s rescue operation in Smithers. The rehabilitation facility has been rescuing injured or orphaned young wildlife since 1989, releasing them back in the wild whenever possible.

There was no word on why the small bear died after arriving at the centre, and no response from the Northern Lights Wildlife Society to our requests for information.

Former Georgia Representative Julian Bond and Black Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver once said that when Rosa Parks chose to stay seated on that bus in Montgomery, Alabama, somewhere in the universe, a gear in the machinery shifted, and everything changed.

A gear-shifting moment.

In the history of this country, in the ongoing fight against racial oppression, against a white supremacist narrative, and against the racial apartheid laws that were passed and upheld, there have always been gear-shifting moments when individual people have taken a stand. It happened in 1850, when Harriet Araminta Tubman, a year after her self-emancipation, chose to go back to Baltimore, Maryland, to help lead her niece and her niece’s two children to freedom. A gear shifted. It happened in 1770, when Crispus Attucks, a Black and Indigenous sailor and whaler, chose to get involved with the growing kerfuffle in Boston. In 1864, when the 22nd Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Colored Troops marched from Camp William Penn through the streets of Philadelphia on their way to fight, gear shifted.

Trending New Heart Drug From Novartis Gets FDA Approval

When Mamie Till told them in 1955 to leave her son’s casket open so that the world could see what those white men had done to her son, a gear in the machinery of the universe shifted, it happened again in 1966 with Kwame Ture and Mukasa Dada’s declaration of Black Power after the “March Against Fear.” In 2014, after police officers killed unarmed Eric Garner in New York and unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Black people came together under the banner and hashtag of Black Lives Matter to march, protest, and demand change. Gears shift when we choose to fight, when we choose to stand up, and when we refuse to back down. The moral arc of the universe does not bend on its own toward justice, it bends because we push it and because we are willing to continue to do it until change does happen.

In 1926, when Dr. Carter G. Woodson—the founder of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH), the son of formerly enslaved parents, a former sharecropper and miner, and the second Black person to receive a Ph.D. in History from Harvard University—sent out a press release announcing the first Negro History Week, a gear shifted. He chose February because the Black community was already celebrating the historic achievements on the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln (2/12) and Frederick Douglass (2/14). Dr. Woodson did not wait for the celebration of our history to be proclaimed, he proclaimed it. He did not wait for someone to permit him to celebrate what we had contributed to this country, he celebrated it. Dr. Woodson understood that Black parents had been teaching their children our history since we arrived in this country. Our stories and achievements had been carried by the wind and buried in the soil. It had been whispered as bedtime stories, spoken from the pulpits on Sunday mornings, and woven throughout our songs and poems of resistance and survival. America did not have to tell us who we were to this country; we told them.

[This post contains video, click to play]

America did not have to tell us that we built this country, our fingerprints are etched into the stone. America does not have to proclaim Black History Month, we proclaim it. We live in the legacy of Dr. Woodson, and as we have done for 98 years, we will celebrate who we are and all that we have accomplished. We stand at the intersection of the past and the future; what we do at this moment will determine how the next gear shifts. The 2025 Black History Month theme is African Americans and Labor, which focuses on the various and profound ways that work and working of all kinds – free and unfree, skilled and unskilled, vocational and voluntary – intersect with the collective experiences of Black people and the transformational work that we have done throughout the U.S., Africa, and the Diaspora. We are celebrating our visible labor—from the work we did back then to build the White House to the work we do right now to hold the White House accountable, from repairing the roads to teaching in our schools, from stocking shelves to packing and unloading trucks; from working in the federal government to our ongoing labor in the state and local offices—and, our invisible labor—from raising and teaching our children to caring for our aging family members, from finding ways to practice revolutionary self-care to finding ways to hope beyond hope in a country that frequently targets and terrorizes Black people. We bear witness to what it means to work hard every day and to get sick and tired of working so hard.

As the president of ASALH, one of the many legacy keepers of Dr. Carter G. Woodson, I am excited to proclaim and uplift the start of Black History Month 2025. I believe that ASALH is a lighthouse that you do not notice until you need it. When boats are caught in a storm or fog, they look for the lighthouse to help guide them safely back to the shore. We have been standing as a lighthouse proudly proclaiming the importance of Black History and helping people to understand that it is only through studying the quilted narrative of our historical journey that one can see the silences, blind spots, hypocrisies, and distortions of American history. We do not celebrate because we are given permission, we celebrate because we are the permission givers. We do not wait for Black History Month to be proclaimed, we proclaim it. We do not wait to be seen, we see ourselves. We do not have to be told the story of America because we are writing it, we are telling it, we are owning it, and we are pointing the way to it. We invite you to join us as we once again celebrate and center the incredible contributions that Black people have made to this beautiful and imperfect nation.

The Supreme Court has rejected another challenge to former President Donald Trump’s ban on so-called bump stocks, which allow a semi-automatic weapon to fire rapidly like a machine gun.

The ruling came on Nov. 14, after the court recognized a constitutional right to bear firearms in public for self-defense in a June decision striking down a New York law that required an applicant to demonstrate “proper cause” to obtain a license to carry a concealed handgun in public.

Significantly, the court also found that gun restrictions must be deeply rooted in American history if they’re to survive constitutional scrutiny.

The ruling has prompted a raft of legal challenges to gun control measures, several of which have been successful.

The ruling also came after President Joe Biden signed a gun control law in June that promotes so-called red flag laws, which encourage reporting gun owners who may be a danger to themselves or others.

Although Trump avoided new gun control measures during his presidency, he promised to ban bump stocks after they were used in a massacre of concertgoers in Las Vegas five years ago.

A group of individuals and gun dealers upset about the Trump ban brought a class-action lawsuit seeking a ruling that the prohibition was an illegal seizure that violated the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution by confiscating private property without providing just compensation.

The case is McCutchen v. United States (court file 22-25).

The U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which considers monetary claims against the federal government, held that the ban was within the government’s authority to outlaw public health and safety hazards.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the ruling, determining that the property right in bump stocks was limited by the preexisting federal ban on machine guns.

While individuals may seek a federal permit for a machine gun, the process is arduous and expensive.

The ban came after gunman Stephen Paddock attached bump stocks to semiautomatic rifles that he used to shoot Route 91 Harvest Music Festival attendees from his hotel room on the Las Vegas Strip on Oct. 1, 2017.

Paddock killed 58 people, wounded hundreds of others, then eluded capture by killing himself. Although theories abound, there has been no official determination of his motives for perpetrating the deadliest mass shooting by an individual in the nation’s history.

The Trump administration banned the sale and possession of bump stocks in late 2018, with the Department of Justice amending the regulations of its Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), finding that bump stocks fall within the definition of “machine gun” under federal law because they “allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger.”

Owners of bump stocks were ordered to destroy them or surrender them to the ATF.

The Supreme Court refused to block the government at that time from enforcing the prohibition and has turned down other challenges to the ban since then. Maryland issued its own bump stock ban, but in May 2021, the Supreme Court refused to take up a challenge to it, as The Epoch Times reported

The litigants in the McCutchen case argued in their petition that the Federal Circuit’s holding “raises fundamental questions about the nature of personal property in a nation in which nearly every object is subject to some general grant of legislative authority to an agency.”

“By redefining the nature of title to personal property in a country dominated by grants of general regulatory authority to executive branch agencies, the Federal Circuit has removed a bedrock restraint on government power and eliminated a means of redress for citizens harmed by exercises of such power,” the petition reads.

“If the Federal Circuit is right, then federal agencies can, with a stroke of a pen, outlaw not just the future sale but the mere private possession of cars that burn too much gas, or light bulbs deemed too inefficient, and so on—without paying a dime of compensation to their owners.”",Q4

Deputies from the Charlevoix County Jail alerted troopers Sunday about an alleged plot involving Caleb Beesley, 26, authorities said in a statement.

Troopers had recently started investigating Beesley for allegations of felonious assault and false imprisonment, according to the release.

""Beesley began a relationship with a woman in April 2021 and allegedly brutally assaulted her for over a year, in several different states, as they traveled together,"" officials said. ""She had been hospitalized because of the attacks.""

Hours before his scheduled released from jail for serving a sentence on an unrelated charge, the Charlevoix County prosecutor authorized additional charges against Beesley for the new allegations. Bond was set at $100,000.""Upon being informed of the new charges, Beesley devised a plan to kill his ex-girlfriend,"" state police said Tuesday. ""Beesley offered to pay another inmate’s bond, provide him additional funds and gifts in exchange for the murder.""

Beesley posted his $100,000 bond and was released on a tether; the inmate he spoke with alerted jail officials.

An arrest warrant was authorized for solicitation - homicide and bond violations. Meanwhile, troopers learned Beesley’s tether was defective but figured out he likely lived with a new girlfriend in Traverse City, MSP said.

Authorities tracked his vehicle to an apartment complex there and arrested him after hours of surveillance.

Beesley was arraigned Tuesday in 90th District Court. The judge did not authorize bond and he remains in jail.

Christian psychologist Ashley Trieu thought she had already come to terms with her body’s limits.

After years of questioning, she began to accept her cerebral palsy on a mission trip to Africa 15 years ago when she and her group leader, who is quadriplegic, discussed Paul’s thorn in the flesh.

“I realized that God had chosen to heal me at a spiritual and emotional level but not physically,” said Trieu, now a 35-year-old mother of two. “And by the end of that trip, I was not just tolerating [my disability] but embracing it.”

Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.

Then came the coronavirus.

In 2020, COVID-19 landed Trieu in the hospital. Her bout with the virus necessitated bimonthly autoimmune infusions that she will need the rest of her life. It also made her realize how much she still expected a certain level of control over her health—and how she’s needing “to rest more in the Lord’s embrace.”

Trieu is one of an estimated 7 million to 23 million Americans who are experiencing long COVID. Around 10 percent to 20 percent of those who contract the disease continue to have symptoms months later; they vary in severity but often include fatigue, brain fog, and breathlessness.

Scientists are still studying what’s behind long COVID, whether the infection persists in tissues and creates inflammation, triggers autoimmune issues that become chronic, or reactivates latent viruses like Epstein-Barr.

Regardless of the etiology, one thing is clear: Both patients and clinicians are learning to live with more uncertainty. And the people around them—family, friends, and church members who seek to care for those with this complex illness—must help them adjust to their new normal.

While church communities regularly care for the sick in their flock through prayers and meals, long COVID isn’t the same as other illnesses. It’s a new condition that emerged in the midst of political clashes and social isolation. There are no clear tests for it, and no timeline for healing. In many ways, it resembles other complex, poorly understood diseases like chronic fatigue. Sufferers can feel misunderstood and are often looking for people to believe them and take their pain seriously.

It meant a lot to Melody Maxwell that her fellow church members in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, brought meals for her for months at a time while she was too ill to grocery shop and cook for herself.

Maxwell has been living with long COVID since a 2020 infection abruptly curtailed her active church life, hiking activities, and rigorous teaching schedule as an associate professor of Christian history at Acadia Divinity College.

“I appreciate those who have stuck with me throughout these long months,” said Maxwell, who has kept friends and fellow Wolfville Baptist Church members updated through her blog. “I wish I weren’t in it for the long haul, but I’m grateful for those friends near and far who haven’t forgotten me throughout it all.”

Beth Crosby is a fellow church member and retired grandmother of seven who has kept in touch with Maxwell regularly through this process.

“I think it’s important to trust and respect the person’s process, and maintain hope on their behalf,” said Crosby. “Our hope is in an eternal God. This allows us to walk alongside a person in uncertainty.”

But others haven’t experienced the support and care they expected. Trieu, who previously served on staff at her church, thought of her community as a place of safety and acceptance. As she suffered from long COVID, their silence was devastating. “There was no real follow-up, no meals,” she said. “It was tough because I had considered these people my family.”

Many in her church were skeptical of masks and vaccination. “Some saw masks as a liberation thing or a fear thing, but I just saw it as a safety thing,” said Trieu, who lives in Kalamazoo, Michigan. “To me it was no different than a peanut allergy. Would we tell someone we wouldn’t accommodate them and to not be afraid?” She and her husband have begun visiting other churches.

Dean and Karen Fritzemeier of Muskegon, Michigan, also changed churches as a result of long COVID, which Dean contracted in October of 2020.

Before then, the 52-year-old walked seven miles a day, taught math at a community college, and served as a deacon at church. His severe long COVID symptoms have left him unable to work, and he relies on a wheelchair to get around outside the home.

“My brain fog feels like a constant heavy dose of Benadryl,” said Dean Fritzemeier, noting that this is a blessing and a curse—it’s hard to think clearly but it also dulls the pain of reflecting on his condition.

Karen Fritzemeier, who has struggled with chronic health issues herself, stopped homeschooling their two children to return to work to support the family.

“I wrestle with forgiving people, but God has taught me how to forgive and show grace, while also setting boundaries,” she said. Their previous church dropped precautions early in the pandemic. When Dean’s health declined, his fellow deacons provided yardwork help but refused to acknowledge his diagnosis for political reasons, she said.

The Fritzemeiers now attend a different church and have received significant financial help from family, friends, and their church community. “Every time I begin to get nervous about money, God says, ‘Here, Karen, I’ve got this,’” she said. A fundraiser for Dean’s hyperbaric chamber treatments this summer raised $6,000, covering the need completely.

Dean and Karen marvel at how their roles have changed (“I used to be the one with a handicapped tag, now he is”), and how their marriage is stronger than ever. “We have learned to live one day at a time because we have to,” said Karen Fritzemeier. “There is still a lot of joy in every day. We don’t feel sorry for ourselves.”

Making life changes

So much of learning to live with a chronic illness like long COVID involves adjusting to new limitations and needs.

Laura Martino is the director of clinical operations for Good Samaritan Health Centers in Norcross, Georgia. Good Samaritan, which offers free healthcare for the uninsured and serves many immigrants, has seen dozens of its patients develop long COVID and is creating protocols to treat them.

“Patients come to us scared and tired and often embarrassed,” said Martino. “But we are able to come alongside them and say, ‘You’re not crazy, and we will walk with you through this as long as it takes.’”

One man came to the clinic’s drive-up tent clinic during a frigid day at the beginning of the pandemic, having just been discharged from the hospital with COVID-19 complications. Wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE), Martino and an assistant got into his car and examined him, then refilled his oxygen and referred him to a pulmonologist and cardiologist.

Nine months later, the man saw big improvements with his long COVID. But he had to make a number of life changes to make this possible: keeping his specialist appointments, remembering to take his medicines, making better food choices to manage his other chronic conditions, and accepting the counseling provided by Good Samaritan to help his wife manage the stress of becoming a caregiver.

This whole-person approach is a necessary part of healing from complex illnesses like long COVID.

“I used to work 50- to 60-hour workweeks but now can only work 20 hours a week,” said Joshua Lickter, pastor of Incarnation Anglican Church in Roseville, California, who has had long COVID for two years. “And I now preach just two times a month instead of four. Any more and I wouldn’t be able to do other things like meet with people one on one and grow our community.”

In his early days of long COVID symptoms, the traditional tools of spiritual formation that he used to lean on—praying, reading the Bible, fellowship—became difficult.

“I used to have a robust morning and evening prayer schedule using the Book of Common Prayer, but suddenly my brain wasn’t working right, and I couldn’t pray or retain Scripture like I used to,” said Lickter, 51. He turned to audiobooks and audio prayers.

He also began to seek God in nature, withdrawing into the Sierra Nevada mountains every few months to practice stillness and reflection. “God speaks to me through the beauty of creation, and I realized this was actually helping rewire my brain,” Lickter said.

His bishop, who is a trauma therapist, explained that mindfulness rewires neural pathways and can help with traumatic stress. Researchers largely agree; for all we don’t know about long COVID, they’ve found mindfulness and support groups help.

Grappling with suffering

Lickter believes his theology of suffering, shaped as his wife coped with a connective tissue disease, helped prepare him for the blows of long COVID. He went public right away with both his long COVID diagnosis and the depression that came in its wake, sharing his experience from the pulpit and granting an interview to a local news station that later shared his story nationally.

“I’ve had emails from people around the country who thanked me for being honest,” said Lickter. “It was refreshing for them to hear Christians say that sometimes life is hard.”

Ashley Trieu regularly explores a theology of suffering with clients in her counseling role.

“It’s important to make space to let people ask these questions,” she said. “Our human brain doesn’t understand—we want to fill in the gaps.”

She cites the John 9 passage where the disciples ask Jesus if a blind man was being punished for his or his family’s sin, and Jesus says it happened that God might be glorified.

“I am glad God didn’t take away my cerebral palsy,” said Trieu. “I get to leverage it every time someone asks me in a grocery store why I walk the way I do. It’s an open door to talk about the gospel.”

Her battle with long COVID provides ongoing opportunities to wrestle with the realities of illness while also proclaiming her faith.

“I don’t have all the answers, and that’s okay,” said Trieu. “This may not be a pretty journey, but I am learning to rest in the unknown.”",Q4

https://www.frontpagemag.com/cair-enraged-over-mobile-billboard-featuring-images-of-mumbai-jihad-attacks/,CAIR Enraged Over Mobile Billboard Featuring Images of Mumbai Jihad Attacks,"A mobile digital billboard drove through the parking lot of the Islamic Center of Middlesex, New Jersey. The rented truck with Pennsylvania plates was displaying images from the 2008 Mumbai jihad attack that killed 166 people. The Hamas-linked Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) held a press conference in response, at which Selaedin Maksut, CAIR’s New Jersey executive director, said:

This is an attempt to intimidate the Muslim community. This is a coordinated effort to cause disruptance [sic], and maybe cast shame or blame on the Muslim community for an incident that happened long ago, in another country and has nothing to do with the people who are residing in this state. We are calling on elected officials in these cities and towns, and in the county, to condemn this incident.

While it is understandable that the Islamic center would not like images of the absolutely horrific Mumbai attacks brought to their front door, whoever decided to have CAIR speak in response was ill-advised.

That is because CAIR is essentially the American branch of Hamas.

CAIR’s Hamas connections come from sources including the Treasury Department, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and a federal judge who wrote in his 2009 decision that the government had produced ample evidence of CAIR’s association with Hamas. (Source: legal decision of Jorge Solis, see top of pg. 15 , Politico.)

Although this has been largely forgotten, forgiven, or covered up lately, one can go back eleven years and see that CAIR’s Hamas connections were reported in the mainstream media.

The CBS affiliate in Oklahoma ran a segment with the then-head of the FBI testifying before Congress on camera, saying that the FBI was distancing itself from CAIR due to concerns about the Islamic group’s national leadership. That would be CAIR’s Hamas connections.

The Dallas Morning News ran a piece with the headline “FBI: CAIR is a front group,” which was based on the open court testimony of FBI Special Agent Lara Burns, who was in charge of analyzing the transcript of a summit meeting of Hamas leaders held in this country. Agent Burns testified that the idea of CAIR was conceived at this meeting. The current executive director of CAIR, Nihad Awad, spoke at that meeting, saying that one of the group’s goals should be justifying the actions of Hamas.

For those who might shrug at this, considering the fact that CAIR operates legally in the United States, there is also CAIR’s public conduct.

Every time “Palestine” is in the news, CAIR will get on TV and accuse Israel of genocide. CAIR also organizes pro-Palestinian rallies that accuse Israel of a holocaust.

During a recent CAIR Zoom conference call, Nihad Awad refers to Israel as the occupation, and CAIR’s deputy executive director Edward Ahmed Mitchell refers to Hamas not as a terrorist group, as it is regarded at the State Department, but simply as a foreign organization.

And here is CAIR giving open-throated support to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, another deadly terrorist organization.

Then again, how can CAIR be as bad as all that if local newscasters let it on TV?

CAIR representatives are frequently on TV. CAIR’s appearances on TV generally do nothing more than promote the organization, bring harm to other people, and to bring some unknown advantage to the TV stations that include them in a broadcast.

The two TV stations that carried CAIR’s New Jersey press conference were WABC and News12. Both stations have a record regarding CAIR.

WABC is losing its way when it comes to CAIR.

WABC ran a completely unnecessary story about a whiny Muslim who claimed he was having trouble sleeping when he touched some bacon.

The same reporter who filed this story also ran with the La Guardia High School protest. CeFaan Kim interviewed a La Guardia High student who claimed an instructor called her “a terrorist.” And, then, as so often happens with CAIR, one of its spokespeople suddenly appears, already talking in full stride. Where did he come from? Was he just walking by? Did CAIR call CeeFan Kim to come to the protest? Does the school know that CAIR is interacting with its students this way? Do the parents know? One thing we do know is that CeeFan Kim knows that stories featuring CAIR are desirable, maybe even profitable.

WABC ran the Wheatley School hoax. When a very imaginative young woman used her graduation speech to talk about “the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians,” she went on to claim she was booed and heckled. WABC accepted this as established fact and put CAIR on TV even though there was no evidence to support her claims. People who attended the ceremony say that absolutely nothing happened to her that day. Why didn’t WABC interview anyone in the audience that day? Because that was not in CAIR’s script.

WABC also ran the Tamar Herman story. As has been discussed here before, CAIR uses other people’s misfortunes to promote itself on TV. In this case, an elementary school teacher sought police protection after becoming the target of a rumor on social media. Rather than cooperate with either the school or police investigations, CAIR got on TV four times to call for the teacher’s termination. Tamar Herman is now suing CAIR for defamation. Don’t expect WABC to cover that story, because doing so would require them to reflect on their role in it.

Good on WABC for including Dr. Atif Nazir on the news.

But without balanced coverage at some point, the public is not going to know who he is. He is not just some wild-eyed fellow. He is a team leader for the Islamic Circle of North America. Like CAIR, this is another front group: ICNA is the American branch of the deadly terrorist group Jamaat-e-Islami.

ICNA has openly identified itself as a JI organization on a number of occasions. Since ICNA’s founding in 1968, its leaders have included Ashrafuzzaman Khan, who during the 1971 Liberation War in Bangladesh served as commander-in-chief of a JI militia group. In 2013, Bangladesh’s International War Crimes Tribunal found Khan guilty of abducting and murdering 18 Bangladeshi intellectuals. Khan was sentenced to death in absentia for his role in the genocide. https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/01/pakistani-terror-groups-charitable-guises-us-funds/

The other station that covered CAIR’s reaction to the mobile digital billboard story was News12.

Unfortunately, News12 also ran the bulldozer story. Although CAIR has no business telling anyone how to run an Indian Independence parade, CAIR made a big deal out of a bulldozer, claiming that its appearance was threatening to Muslims.

But if the station had just done a little research, it would have found that the bulldozer has become a symbol of righteous resistance against violent Muslims who have rioted and murdered people over perceived insults to Islam. Some Indian authorities have bulldozed the homes of jihad terrorists.

Whether summary justice is a good thing or not is beside the point. The TV station took CAIR’s narrative and ran with it, never thinking of telling the other side of the story.

TV stations around the country refuse not just to learn about Islam, but also about the various Muslims groups that operate in this country.

https://www.fox5dc.com/news/voters-in-key-battleground-states-will-decide-on-ballot-proposals-that-could-reshape-voting-rights-in-2024,Voters in key battleground states will decide on ballot proposals that could reshape voting rights in 2024,"

All but lost in the shadow of major contests for U.S. Senate and governor, voters in some battleground states will be deciding ballot proposals this November that could reshape the way they vote in the next presidential election.

In Arizona, scene of the closest presidential contest in 2020, the question is whether to require more identification to vote in the future. In Michigan, another swing state, voters will consider whether to make it easier to cast early ballots.

Voting-related proposals will be on the ballot in several other states, including a measure to adopt ranked-choice voting in Nevada that — if approved this year — would need a second vote in 2024 to take effect.""

Most of the measures are garnering little attention but could have profound effects on voting in some of the most politically competitive states for years to come. They mark an escalation of what voting expert Jon Sherman describes as ""the voting wars"" — battles between Democrats, Republicans and activist groups over laws specifying how people register, obtain mail-in ballots, prove their identity and cast ballots.

""The parties and their allies are fighting over every last voting rule and trying to make predictions about how they think it will help or hurt their chances of winning, particularly in closely competitive states,"" said Sherman, litigation director and senior counsel at the Fair Elections Center, a nonprofit that advocates for voting access.

Efforts to change voting laws ramped up after the 2000 presidential election, when a U.S. Supreme Court decision in Florida's exceptionally close race gave Republican George W. Bush the victory over Democrat Al Gore. It intensified after the 2020 election, as Republican President Donald Trump refused to acknowledge his loss to Democrat Joe Biden while pressing false claims of widespread fraud,and some Republican-led states responded by passing restrictive voting laws.

Arizona, which Biden won by about 10,500 votes, was one center of controversy. After a six-month review focused on Arizona's largest county, a Trump friendly firm hired by Republican state lawmakers ended up with vote results confirming Democrat Biden's victory.

Republicans who control the Legislature subsequently placed a proposed constitutional amendment on the November ballot that would strengthen voter identification laws. It would require people voting in person to show a photo ID, and eliminate a current alternative of providing two documents bearing a person's name and address, such as a recent utility bill and bank statement.

People voting with mailed ballots — the vast majority in Arizona — would have to list their date of birth and either their driver’s license number, a state identification number or the last four digits of their Social Security number.

Republican state Sen. J.D. Mesnard, who sponsored the measure, said the intent is to ""make the election as secure as possible"" while addressing ""a growing crisis in confidence"" that could discourage some people from voting.

But rather than reassuring voters, tougher ID requirements could dissuade some from voting at all and actually lead to fraud by exposing personal information, said Darrell Hill, policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, which opposes the measure.

""You’re opening people up to greater potential identity theft,"" Hill said.

Only a few states — Georgia, Minnesota, Ohio — have similar proof-of-identity measures for mailed ballots, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Arkansas requires voters to provide a copy of a photo ID when returning a mailed ballot.

In Michigan next month, a ballot initiativewould pre-empt Republican attempts to tighten photo identification laws by amending the state Constitution to include the current alternative of signing an affidavit. It also would expand early voting options, require state-funded return postage and drop boxes for absentee ballots, and specify that the Board of State Canvassers has only a ""clerical, nondiscretionary"" duty to certify election results.

Trump allies had tried to persuade canvassers to delay certifying the 2020 results.

The goal of the new initiative is to ""enhance the integrity and security of the elections by sort of modernizing how they’re administered and making them more accessible,"" said Khalilah Spencer, president of Promote the Vote, which backs the measure.

On the other side, Michigan Republican Party spokesman Gustavo Portela said the initiative ""opens the door up for fraud"" through the combination of early voting and a constitutional exception to showing photo ID.

Just four states — Alabama, Connecticut, Mississippi and New Hampshire — lack an in-person early voting option for all voters. Connecticut's November ballot will feature a proposed constitutional amendment authorizing the Democratic-led General Assembly to create an early voting law. A similar ballot proposal failed in 2014.

Supporters in Connecticut hope this time is different — both because the new version is more clearly written and because the vote comes after the coronavirus pandemic heightened awareness about early voting.

""The idea that everybody has free time on a Tuesday between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. -- and that’s their only opportunity to participate in our democracy -- is a little dated,"" said Democratic state Sen. Mae Flexer, co-chair of the Connecticut legislative committee that sponsored the measure.

In Nebraska, Republicans haven't been able to get a voter photo ID bill through the nonpartisan Legislature. But it will appear on the November ballot, thanks to an initiative petition drive bankrolled by Marlene Ricketts, the mother of term-limited Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts.

Civic Nebraska, a voting rights group opposed to the measure, describes it as ""a solution in search of a problem.""

""There’s not an iota of evidence in Nebraska that says we would need this extra step"" to vote, said Civic Nebraska spokesman Steve Smith.

Gov. Ricketts acknowledged during a recent radio call-in show that there hasn't been much election fraud. But he said ""one of the things that came out of the 2020 election is that people had concern about the integrity of our voting systems.""

There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Judges have turned away dozens of challenges by Trump and his allies, multiple state reviews have confirmed the results, and Trump's own Department of Justice concluded the election outcome was accurate.

Nevada's proposed constitutional amendment would advance the top five vote-getters in an open primary. It then would use ranked-choice voting to determine the winner of the general election. If no candidate received a majority on the first count, the votes for the bottom candidate would be reassigned to voters' next preferences until one candidate has a majority.

A similar system already exists for some elections in Maine, where Republicans have opposed it. Ranked-choice voting also began this year in Alaska. Former Republican Gov. Sarah Palin derided it as ""crazy, convoluted, confusing"" after losing a special election for U.S. House in August.

Nevada's ranked-choice initiative has been opposed by majority Democrats, including Gov. Steve Sisolak, who said it ""would make our system confusing, error-prone, and exclusionary.""",Q4

""I live in Hebron, a mother to six sweet children and drive on terror-stricken roads … I am also married to the most threatened man in the country. I have a gun. Deal with it,"" she wrote.

Israel's West Bank settlements, such as Kiryat Arba near Hebron where the Ben-Gvir family live, are regarded as illegal under international law by most countries, including Britain, though Israel disputes this.

It is not unusual for settlers to carry firearms, which they say are necessary to defend themselves from Palestinian attackers. On Tuesday, three Israelis were killed in a Palestinian stabbing and car-ramming attack near the West Bank settlement of Ariel.

Ben-Gvir known to brandish his gun during speeches

Mr Ben-Gvir himself also carries a gun and has been known to brandish it during his speeches, including one during the election campaign in the Palestinian neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah in East Jerusalem.

Last December, he pulled out his gun during an argument with an Arab security guard in a car park in Tel Aviv, claiming he felt threatened.

The Right-wing politician's Religious Zionism movement emerged as the third largest party in this month's elections, and he has demanded to become Israel's police and security minister in the next government.

A hugely controversial figure due to his 2007 conviction for inciting racism and supporting a Jewish terrorist organisation, Mr Ben-Gvir once kept a photograph of mass-murderer Baruch Goldstein on display in his living room.

COLUMBUS, Ohio — Officers with the Grandview Heights Division of Police have arrested two teenage suspects who reportedly stole a vehicle and crashed into a police cruiser while evading officers.

According to police, officers were called to Grandview Yard on a report of a theft in progress just before 8 p.m. When officers arrived, they found the suspects in the parking garage north of 850 Goodale Boulevard.

The suspects, 18-year-old Nadia Telthorster and a 15-year-old girl, were driving a Land Rover that was stolen from Dublin earlier that day. One of the suspects crashed into a Grandview Heights police cruiser before exiting the garage.

The officer in the cruiser was not injured, a statement from police said.

Officers from both Grandview and the Columbus Division of Police found the stolen vehicle shortly after the incident and Telthorster and the girl were taken into custody.

The girl is charged with felonious assault on a police officer and receiving stolen property. Telthorster is charged with receiving stolen property.

Police said that they are still looking to identify a male juvenile who may have been involved in this incident.

An investigation is ongoing to determine if a robbery that occurred on Nov. 29 in the Grandview Yard is connected.",Q4

According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, testing of male DNA from a sexual assault kit identified Madisonville resident Gerald Lynn Smith as the suspect in the 1994 rape and murder of Gloria Hansell, a 69-year-old widow who lived alone in Gary, Indiana and was in poor health.

Movement on the crucial DNA testing in the decades-long cold case began in 2020, which is when the feds said they asked Indiana State Police Lowell Regional Laboratory to “re-examine evidence” in the case.

The feds said investigators found Smith was not only in the city where the brutal killing occurred but also that he knew Hansell.

“Upon further re-investigation of this case, [the FBI’s Gang Response Investigative Team] GRIT investigators were able to place Smith in Gary shortly before Hansell’s murder and learned he knew Hansell,” the FBI said.

Smith, who was 32 at the time of the June 17, 1994 slaying, allegedly tried went to the woman’s home at least twice before the deadly attack. Authorities said that he tried to mow the victim’s lawn and attempted to kiss the victim on her neck before he allegedly killed her.

“A witness reported Smith, who was 32 years old at the time of the murder, had gone to Hansell’s house on at least two occasions in the weeks before her murder and said he had just moved back into the area from out of state. The witness stated on one occasion Smith asked Hansell if he could cut her grass for money, but she declined his offer,” the FBI said. “The witness stated on another occasion Hansell said Smith made an unwanted advance towards her inside her house that made her uncomfortable when he tried to kiss her neck.”

Hansell “relied on an in-home oxygen machine due to poor health,” the FBI said.

A probable cause affidavit obtained by Law&Crime reveals more.

Authorities said Hansell was strangled with an electrical cord from a nearby “squared shaped fan” in the living room.

The victim’s daughter Cary told investigators that Gerald Smith had actually dated her sister when they were teenage girls. She recalled that Smith got someone else pregnant, moved to California with his brother, but returned to Indiana several years later.

“Cary stated Gerald came back to Gary after approximately five (5) years and came over to her mother’s house,” the affidavit said. “Cary stated she was there when Gerald showed up looking for her sister. Cary stated while Gerald was there, he wanted to say hello to her mother.”

“Cary stated Gerald came back another time and asked her mother if he could cut her grass for some money,” documents added, alleging that Smith went on to make unwanted advances while Hansell was in her rocking chair.

“Cary stated she was unaware if Gerald was on drugs at the time he visited her mother. Cary described Gerald as a ‘little bit too smiley,'” the affidavit said. “Carey stated Gerald had long hair and described him as a little strange.”

Smith now faces rape and murder charges in Lake County, Indiana, state court records show. The second murder charge was issued because the killing allegedly occurred while “committing or attempting to commit […] rape.”

Although the FBI announced the major development in the cold case on Tuesday, Indiana court records reviewed by Law&Crime indicate that the case hit the docket on Sept. 28. A charging information and the probable cause affidavit were filed the same day. A Lake County magistrate judge found probable cause and issued a warrant for Smith’s arrest.

Court records show that the warrant was served on Monday, Oct. 17 — hence the FBI’s announcement the following day.

A court hearing in the case was scheduled to take place on Wednesday morning.

The FBI said that Smith’s arrest means its GRIT unit has now solved 11 cold cases over the last four years.

“GRIT Investigators are provided training in several disciplines and use that training to further their cases as well as pass on what they learn to FBI agents and TFO’s [Task Force Officers] across the country,” the FBI has said of the unit.

By Mnar Adley / MintPress News, https://scheerpost.com/2023/12/15/israel-is-wiping-out-gazas-journalists-a-tribute/

I recently became the recipient of the Women and Media Award from the Women’s Institute of the Freedom of the Press. While it’s truly an honor to receive this recognition for the journalism that I direct at MintPress News, it’s nearly impossible for me to revel in this accolade when my heart is weighed down heavily by the ongoing turmoil in Gaza.

As a Palestinian-American journalist who has lived under the oppressive shadow of Israeli occupation and witnessed firsthand the relentless brutality of the apartheid regime, I cannot remain silent as my people face relentless oppression and violence.

I want to dedicate this award to the fearless journalists in Gaza who are risking their lives to show us the raw reality of life under Israeli bombs.

Since October 7th, the death toll stands stark and horrific – Israel is systematically taking out journalists, one by one, and killing their families. The Israeli military has already claimed the lives of at least 82 Palestinian journalists in Gaza. These courageous individuals, committed to unveiling the truth, have become direct targets of a regime desperate to cloak its genocidal actions from the world’s scrutiny.

Israel doesn’t want the world to see the reality of its genocidal onslaught in Gaza, so it’s assassinating the messengers.



In most parts of the world, wearing a flack jacket marked “press” gives you protection. But right now in Palestine, it may as well be a target, as Israel has turned Gaza into what the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has called a “cemetery for journalists.”

And you’d think mainstream corporate journalists would talk about the targeting of journalists in Gaza, but they’re not. If legacy media outlets like the New York Times or CNN cover Palestinian journalists killed in Gaza, they don’t have the basic journalistic integrity to say who killed them and fail to point out that Israel is systematically targeting them.

Corporate media are whitewashing Israeli crimes and playing the fool, pretending not to understand where the missiles come from. They pretend not to hear the genocidal rhetoric emanating from Tel Aviv. And even as Israel makes Gaza the most dangerous place in the world to be a journalist, they ignore what is in front of their eyes, manufacturing consent for ethnic cleansing.

Brave women have lost their lives trying to document the Israeli onslaught. Women like Alaa Taher Al-Hassanat, a presenter for the AlMajedat Media Network, whose house was bombarded by Israeli missiles on November 20.

Or Salma Mkhaimer, killed alongside her child in an Israeli air strike on her house in Rafah, Gaza.

And Freelance journalist Ayat Khadoura was also killed in her home by an Israeli air strike. In her “last message to the world” posted on Instagram, she said: “We used to have big dreams, but now our dream is to be killed in one piece so they know who we are.”

This only continues a long history of Israel systematically targeting journalists since its founding in 1948.

Just last year, Israel went so far as to murder our beloved Shireen Abu-Akleh, an American citizen and recipient of the same Women and Media Award that I’m receiving today. And in 2021, it blew up the Associated Press building in Gaza. Yet throughout all this, Israel continues to get a free pass in corporate media.

Despite the hardships, many journalists are risking their lives working around the clock to document the genocide in Gaza. Journalists like Motaz Azaiza, Younis Tirawi, Muhammad Smiry, Motasem Mortaja, Wael Dahdouh, and Hind Khoudary, to name a few, speak truth to power, chronicling the horrors in Gaza.

These people show us in real-time the courage it often takes to be a journalist. And because of that, dozens pay the ultimate price for their bravery.

This award I humbly dedicate to them—the fallen journalists who were mercilessly taken by Israel and those who, against all odds, continue to broadcast to the world the unimaginable horrors of life under incessant bombings.

As for journalists like myself, we vow to carry on their legacy and amplify their voices in the West. We will repeat their message of hope and truth while we challenge and confront the very system perpetuating my people’s destruction, supported directly by our governments and their lapdog media.

If wars can be ignited by deceit, then let us rally for peace through unwavering truth.",Q4
https://bearingarms.com/camedwards/2022/11/23/minnesota-prosecutors-deliver-slap-on-the-wrist-on-machine-gun-charges-n64653,Minnesota prosecutors deliver slap on the wrist on machine gun charges,"According to gun control activists, the only (or at least the best) way to combat violent crime is by creating more non-violent, possessory criminal offenses involving firearms. Every call to “do something” is, in reality, a demand to put more laws on the books; a cycle that inevitably repeats itself when those new laws fail to curb violent criminal activity.

Meanwhile, what about all the existing laws in place? Oh sure, gun control activists will complain when “red flag” laws aren’t used, but it’s exceedingly rare for gun control organizations or even individual activists to ever object when light sentences are handed down for violating laws that are already in place.

We’ve been writing quite a bit, for instance, about the growing number of auto sears that authorities say are popping up around the country. The small devices, which are either smuggled in from China or produced on 3D printers domestically, illegally modify semi-automatic handguns and rifles to shoot multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger. Possession of these devices is a federal crime, as well as illegal under most state law, and those convicted in federal court can receive up to ten years in prison.

Two brothers from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area who were caught in possession of illegally modified handguns didn’t receive a ten-year term, however. In fact, when they were prosecuted in Hennepin County, Minnesota they got off with minor consequences. Unsurprisingly, the only lesson the pair learned from their first run-in with the law is that they had little to fear by breaking it.

Twin brothers in the metro area have pleaded guilty after they were found to be in illegal possession of firearms and ammunition while being on probation for a separate weapons conviction, according to officials. The U.S. Attorney’s Office says Quantez Demarco Ward and Cortez Demario Ward, both 19 years old, pleaded guilty on Monday to illegal possession of a firearm as a felon and illegal possession of ammunition as a felon, respectively. At the beginning of the year, both brothers were charged in Hennepin County District Court for modifying firearms with auto sears. They pleaded guilty to those charges and were released on terms of probation, court documents show.

After they were released on probation, the Wards were pulled over for a traffic stop in Maple Grove, Minnesota. Officers discovered Cortez Ward carrying a 9mm pistol, and apparently this time around local authorities brought in the feds. Two months later their home was the subject of a federal search warrant that turned up multiple firearms as well as ammunition, and the two men were charged in U.S. District Court, where they recently accepted a guilty plea.

The brothers haven’t been sentenced yet, but I suspect this time around they’ll get several years in a federal penitentiary as opposed to the slap on the wrist they received in Hennepin County District Court.

You’d think this would be the type of case that would have gun control activists raising hell, but there’s been nothing but silence, even from locals in the Twin Cities. Two teenagers caught illegally carrying guns that they’d illegally modified to turn into machine guns get probation, and not even a peep from the crowd routinely demanding that concealed carry licensees face felony charges if they so much as set foot into a designated “sensitive place”?

Violent crime has been rising in Hennepin County, as it has across much of the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in the years since the riots over the murder of George Floyd. And yet when prosecutors and a judge allow the Wards to not only receive probation for their original crime, but to apparently avoid being sent to jail after Cortez Ward was once again discovered with a gun just a few months later, the gun control lobby is mum; demanding neither action nor accountability from the criminal justice system. Instead, they remain laser-focused on infringing on the rights of peaceable gun owners; including trying to convince the Biden administration to impose a gun ban through regulation, not legislation.",Q4

The female students, Abriauna Hoffman, 18, Magdalyn ‘Maggie’ Ogden, 18, and Hunter Balberdi, 19, were one of 4 vehicles involved in the crash at around 4 a.m., reported ABC15. The wrong-way driver was allegedly alone, driving northbound in the southbound lanes on Interstate 17. Two of the girls were pronounced dead at the scene, and the third was in critical condition but later died at a Phoenix hospital, the outlet reported.

The driver of the wrong-way vehicle was transported to the hospital in serious condition, the Arizona Department of Public Safety (DPS) said in a press release. The drivers of the two other cars involved in the collision sustained non-life threatening injuries, according to DPS. (RELATED: Fiery, High-Impact Los Angeles Car Crash Kills 6 And Injures 9)

DPS suspect impairment may have caused the crash, but an investigation is ongoing, they said.

It is with heavy hearts and great sadness that we share with you that three GCU students passed away this morning after a collision. The 3 students – Abriauna Hoffman, Hunter Balberdi and Magdalyn “Maggie” Ogden – were all freshmen and suitemates in Diamondback Apartments (1/3) — Grand Canyon U (@gcu) October 11, 2022

Hoffman was reportedly a marketing and advertising major at GCU, and Ogden and Balberdi with both pre-med.

“They were all really sweet,” Ella McGinley, a GCU student, shared with ABC15.

McKinley and another student, Sasha Snegirova, were reportedly hanging out with the victims right before the crash. Snegirova shared that Ogden had celebrated her birthday two days prior.

“We did exactly what they did two weeks ago,” said McGinley. “We left at two in the morning to go see the sunrise at the Grand Canyon and that’s what they were going to do. Because we go on trips every weekend. It’s weird now. I don’t want to go on trips anymore.”

Snegirova shared the girls’ departure felt weird to her, saying, “Even when I said goodbye, the hug. They all hugged us really tight. It was really weird.”

“Even when I said bye, I was like ‘Ella, I love them so much,'” she highlighted.

The Arizona Department of Transportation is aware that wrong-way driving has been a persistent issue, ABC15 reported. The department launched a wrong-way vehicle alert and detection system following a similar accident occurred in 2017 when two GCU students were killed in a wrong-way crash, according to the outlet.

In a press release shared by ABC15, ADOT stated the system has reduced police response time and has lowered risks associated with impaired drivers. The department, however, is aware the technology can’t fully prevent accidents occurring from wrong-way driving.

“The system is designed to quickly alert DPS troopers and ADOT to potential wrong-way vehicles much faster than 911 calls from other drivers,” ADOT said in a statement. “As a statewide community, we all just continue to battle against impaired driving.”",Q4

NEW YORK (Reuters) – A U.S. judge on Friday dismissed an indictment against Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Co, formally ending a criminal sanctions case that strained U.S.-China relations.

Meng, whose father Ren Zhengfei founded Huawei and is the telecommunications company’s chief executive, entered an agreement with U.S. prosecutors last year for the case to be dismissed four years after her December 2018 arrest.

Prosecutors accused Meng of bank fraud and other crimes for misleading HSBC Holdings Plc and other banks about Huawei’s relationship with a company that operated in Iran.

They said Meng’s actions put banks at risk of penalties for processing transactions that violated U.S. sanctions.

Huawei has pleaded not guilty to related U.S. criminal charges.

U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in Brooklyn dismissed Meng’s indictment with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought again.

A lawyer for Meng and a spokeswoman for Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Meng spent nearly three years under house arrest in Canada following her arrest at a Vancouver airport.

She entered a deferred prosecution agreement with U.S. prosecutors in Sept. 2021 in which she acknowledged having made false statements about Huawei’s Iran business.

On the day Donnelly approved that agreement, Meng flew home to Shenzhen.

Shortly afterward, China released two Canadians it had been holding, and two American siblings who had been prevented from leaving the country were allowed to fly home.

Meng, 50, now serves as Huawei’s rotating chairwoman and deputy chairwoman, as well as CFO.

The United States still views Huawei as a national security threat.

On Nov. 25, the Biden administration banned approvals of new telecommunications equipment from Huawei and China’s ZTE Corp because they posed an “unacceptable risk” to national security.

WASHINGTON — A pro-life group is calling for the impeachment of United States Attorney General Merrick Garland following a raid on a pro-life activist's home.

Led by Terrisa Bukovinac of the Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, pro-life activists held a press conference outside the Department of Justice Wednesday, less than two weeks after the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania arrested Mark Houck, a pro-life activist, for allegedly violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act.

The FACE Act subjects federal charges on anyone who “intentionally injures, intimidates, or interferes with or attempts to injure, intimidate or interfere with any person” aiding or performing abortions. The DOJ maintains that “the defendant is alleged to have twice assaulted a man because he was a volunteer reproductive health care clinic escort,” according to a statement.

However, a fundraiser set up following Houck’s arrest contends that the pro-life activist and his 12-year-old son were “harassed” by the clinic escort as they prayed outside a Philadelphia Planned Parenthood facility: “When one of the escorts began harassing Mark’s son, they walked down the street away from the entrance to the building. The escort followed them, and when he continued yelling at Mark’s son, Mark pushed him away.”

The early morning raid on Houck’s home, followed by his arrest, sparked outrage in the pro-life community. In remarks at the press conference, Bukovinac cited the raid on Houck’s home as the latest example of the DOJ’s targeting of pro-life activists “while allowing violent pro-abortion extremists to terrorize churches and pregnancy centers across the country.”

Bukovinac said she has “watched in horror as the U.S. Department of Justice has been weaponized to arrest peaceful, non-violent pro-life activists.” She added that the FACE Act was cited as the justification used to charge “at least 18 peaceful, nonviolent protesters” in the past year with federal crimes. Bukovinac characterized the legislation, passed in 1994, as an effort that was designed to “crush a nonviolent resistance that mobilized tens of thousands of people for direct action on behalf of the unborn.”

Randall Terry, the founder of the pro-life group Operation Rescue, was “the reason that the FACE Act was enacted in the first place,” she added.

“When Bill Clinton was elected, he appointed Janet Reno as his attorney general,” Terry recalled in his comments at the news conference. “When she came up to the microphone in her press conference, she said one of her top priorities was to break the back of Operation Rescue.”

Noting that the FACE Act passed less than two years later, Terry insisted that “it was always designed to isolate people of faith who wanted to defend the unborn.”

In an interview with The Christian Post, Terry said that “between 1987 and 1994, we accumulated over 75,000 arrests around the country for peacefully blockading abortion clinics.”

“We would sit there, 100, 200, 500 people and not let anyone in. We closed them for the whole day and saved the babies that were scheduled to die that day,” he added. Under the FACE Act, pro-life activists went from facing “local trespass charges” to “now facing a federal misdemeanor for the first offense and a federal felony for the second offense.” Terry added that “once that law was passed, it effectively broke the back of our movement.”

“There’s no basis for FACE anymore,” Bukovinac told CP, because “FACE is predicated on the ruling in Roe v. Wade that the Supreme Court now says was ‘egregiously wrong’ from the beginning.”

While most of the news conference focused on the DOJ’s efforts to prosecute pro-life activists, Bukovinac echoed the concerns of other pro-life activists that “the Department of Justice has allowed more than 50 pregnancy centers to be attacked.” She noted that “the FACE Act is designed to protect pregnancy centers and churches as well.”

The Christian Post has compiled lists of churches and pro-life pregnancy centers that have found themselves subject to vandalism and firebombing after Politico published a draft opinion of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization indicating that the justices were poised to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide, as well as the additional vandalism that has taken place following the June 24 Dobbs decision.

“We have also seen churches blocked by pro-abortion radicals without any action taken by the Department of Justice,” Bukovinac lamented. “This is unjust. We cannot allow this discrimination to continue. We are urging Congress to take action; we are urging them to impeach Garland to protect justice and to dismantle the FACE Act altogether.”

Another speaker at the news conference, Jonathan Darnell of the advocacy group Get Serious Church, discussed the legal challenges he faces as a result of his pro-life activism: “About two years ago, I was videotaping a peaceful pro-life rescue at a local abortion clinic and that’s all that happened. I went home a free man at the end of the day. I didn’t hear anything from DC authorities, nothing from the FBI, nothing, not a letter, nothing, for two years.”

“Then, this March, at [the] crack of dawn in the morning, [the] FBI breaks down my door. A bunch of agents come through with guns drawn, just like they did with Mark Houck. Thankfully, there [were] no kids in our house.”

Now, Darnell finds himself subject to up to 11 years in prison for violating the FACE Act. Darnell pleaded with pro-life governors across the U.S. to take action by urging the FBI to stop “persecuting citizens based on a political bias.”

“I would like to know what pro-life governors are doing allowing the FBI to operate in their states anymore,” he said. “When they’re behaving like this, why are you even allowing the federal government to do these [sorts] of things within your states?” he asked.

Darnell's message to pro-life governors is: “If the federal government’s not going to do its job, if Merrick Garland’s going to walk, just don’t let them operate in your state.” He also called on “pro-life police officers” as well as “individual FBI agents” to refrain from carrying out orders that violate their oath of office.

The event that led Darnell to face charges under the FACE Act took place at Dr. Cesare Santangelo’s abortion clinic in Washington, D.C., in late October 2020. Darnell founded Get Serious Church as part of an effort to address “the lack of numbers of pro-life people that want to be active.”

“Nobody wants to rescue, nobody wants to be on the street with a sign or talk to their neighbors,” he said. “Most people just want to pray and vote, sometimes march at the March for Life or give a little money to the [crisis pregnancy centers].”

Wednesday's protest outside the DOJ concluded with the pro-life leaders and onlookers shouting chants proclaiming “Protect justice, impeach Garland.”

PAAU will lead a separate protest in front of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, the federal court that spearheaded Houck's arrest, on Thursday.

When asked if PAAU and pro-life activists would hold a protest in front of the FBI headquarters, Bukovinac responded, “it’s possible.” She predicted that as the DOJ’s actions become “more and more draconian, more and more people are going to come out wanting to oppose this tyranny, and I think you’re going to see a lot more events.”

Bukovinac expressed confidence that the actions of the FBI and DOJ that led PAAU to organize the protest would “have an unintended effect of actually mobilizing people for direct action rather than quashing it, which is their intention.”

Last year, Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., introduced articles of impeachment against Garland over the DOJ’s memo likening parents concerned about sexually explicit curriculum, LGBT ideology and critical race theory in public schools to domestic terrorism.

More than 600 Christian tribals remained displaced on Christmas Day in India’s Chhattisgarh state, a week after radical Hindu nationalists launched a spate of attacks on them in 20 villages, vandalizing their homes, churches and properties for refusing to “re-convert” to Hinduism.

The attacks took place last Sunday in 20 villages in the districts of Narayanpur and Kondagaon as Christians gathered for worship, the U.S.-based persecution watchdog International Christian Concern said.

The attackers used bamboo sticks to attack Christians and looted and destroyed their homes and desecrated three churches, ICC continued. Several people were severely injured and hospitalized, while others fled to the jungle or to nearby police stations, it added.

The attacks were reported in the villages of Borpal, Modenga, Palna, Gohda, Aamasara, Modenga, Kongera, Mainpur, Kibai Balenga, Puswal, Kokdi, Kulhad, Khargaon and Shantinagar, among others.

“Small kids and women with their families were sitting in open places in biting cold, with no food or water, warming their hands with their breath,” a witness was quoted as saying.

Christians reported the attacks to authorities but police allegedly told them to fend for themselves.

Some of the displaced Christians are being kept in community halls and a stadium in the region.

Attacks against tribal Christians have increased since radical Hindu groups launched a campaign in 2020 to stop the country’s tribal, or indigenous, people from converting to Christianity. These groups have been demanding that the government ban those who convert from receiving education and employment opportunities.

Most tribals do not identify as Hindus; they have diverse religious practices and many worship nature. However, the government’s Census deems them to be Hindu.

“Christian persecution has skyrocketed in India since Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his BJP (Bharatiya Janta Party) took power in 2014,” ICC President Jeff King said. “With the goal to set up India as a Hindu nation, they have passed laws and enforced policies targeting Christians. The attacks this week are the result of this overarching hostility toward followers of Christ. It has created an increasingly dangerous climate for Indian believers.”

In September 2020, tribal villagers vandalized 16 houses belonging to Christians from the same tribe in three separate attacks in Chhattisgarh, forcing most of the Christian women in those villages to flee into jungles for safety at the time.

Christians make up only 2.3% of India’s population, and Hindus comprise about 80%.

The watchdog group Open Doors USA, which monitors persecution in over 60 countries, reports that “Hindu radicals often attack Christians with little to no consequences.”

“Hindu extremists believe that all Indians should be Hindus and that the country should be rid of Christianity and Islam,” an Open Doors fact sheet on India explains. “They use extensive violence to achieve this goal, particularly targeting Christians from a Hindu background. Christians are accused of following a ‘foreign faith’ and blamed for bad luck in their communities.”

ICC quoted a local Christian leaders as saying that the large-scale violent attacks in Chhattisgarh brought back “traumatic memories” of the violence in Orissa state’s Kandhamal district, which is also a tribal-majority district.

The leader was referring to August 2008 when radical Hindu nationalists killed at least 39 Christians and destroyed 3,906 homes. “These incidents have shocked the entire Christian community in the state, and the sad thing is that the people in authority did not bother to help.”",Q4

Judge Celene Gogerty found there was no process for reversing a permanent injunction that blocked the abortion law in 2019.

Gov. Kim Reynolds said in a statement that she would appeal the decision to the Iowa Supreme Court.

Current state law bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but Reynolds asked the courts to reverse the 2019 decision that blocked a bill she had signed into law the previous year. That law prohibited abortions once cardiac activity can be detected — the “fetal heartbeat” concept — which usually happens around six weeks of pregnancy and is often before many women know they’re pregnant.

Reynolds argued that because of decisions earlier this year by the U.S. Supreme Court and the Iowa Supreme Court that found woman have no constitutional right to abortion, the Iowa judge should reverse the 2019 decision blocking the abortion law.

Lawyers for Iowa’s largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, countered that there is no precedent or legal support for reversing a decision finalized by a judge years earlier. They said Reynolds must go through the legislative process to pass a new law.

Reynolds did not appeal the decision when it was handed down in 2019.

At that time, Judge Michael Huppert’s decision was based on U.S. Supreme Court precedent, as well as an Iowa Supreme Court decision in 2018 that declared abortion a fundamental right under the Iowa Constitution.

Reynolds, who supports outlawing abortions, decided to turn to the courts to impose stricter abortion limits instead of calling a special session of the legislature to pass a new law.

In her decision Monday, Gogerty wrote that state law didn’t give her the power to dissolve the permanent injunction and let the new abortion law take effect. Even if she had that power, Gogerty wrote that the Iowa Supreme Court decision finding no constitutional right to abortion didn’t substantially change how the abortion law would have been judged under the Iowa Constitution.

In her statement, the governor expressed disappointment the law approved by the Legislature wasn’t allowed to take effect, but she noted an appeal to the state Supreme Court was always expected, regardless of the judge’s decision. The current court is far more conservative than in 2018 when it declared a right to abortion, with five of the court’s seven members named by Reynolds.

“The decision of the people’s representatives to protect life should be honored, and I believe the court will ultimately do so,” Reynolds said. “As long as I’m governor, I will continue to fight for the sanctity of life and for the unborn.”

Planned Parenthood North Central States didn’t immediately respond to a request for a comment about the ruling.

Although Iowa’s law blocked by the courts seeks to prevent abortions when a “fetal heartbeat” can be detected, this does not easily translate to medical science. That’s because the point where advanced technology can detect that first visual flutter, the embryo isn’t yet a fetus, and it doesn’t have a heart. An embryo is termed a fetus eight weeks after fertilization.

The Iowa law contains exceptions for medical emergencies, including threats to the mother’s life, rape, incest, and fetal abnormality.",Q4

New York State Assemblywoman Emily Gallagher told the Daily News she learned of the backlog at the Office of Rent Administration while investigating a constituent’s case.

Without an avenue to resolve allegations of overcharging, tenants can find themselves unfairly priced out of their homes.

People gather for a rally protesting rent hikes at City Hall Park on April 28, 2022.

“If it takes four years to get that money back and you’re still being overcharged the entire time, you can’t afford that apartment,” Andrea Shapiro, a tenant advocate with the Met Council on Housing, told The News. “The implications are huge.”

Under state law, landlords cannot raise rents for rent stabilized apartments beyond statutorily approved hikes — unless they make building-wide or apartment-specific improvements, such as installing a new stove or flooring. Even so, these rent increases need to be approved by the state Department of Homes and Community Renewal.

The conflict arises when a tenant believes the landlord has inflated the value of those upgrades, or in some cases, fabricated them altogether.

Nick LeMessurier is in a battle with his Brooklyn landlord over what he says are unlawful overcharges. After ten years in his rent stabilized, two-bedroom apartment, LeMessurier said his landlord jacked up the rent 20% last year — from $1,650 to $2,000. He claims his landlord told him the apartment was no longer stabilized, something that often happens while a unit is vacant and gets substantially renovated.

But his unit wasn’t vacant or renovated, LeMessurier said. Six months after filing a report, LeMessurier hasn’t heard back.

“When I called them they just told me that no one has been put on the case.”

Now, he said, his landlord is demanding $3,500 per month and threatening eviction.

“The New York rental market right now is vicious,” LeMessurier, a designer, said. “For me to have my housing insecure would mean that I would immediately have to leave the city.”

Officials at the Office of Rent Administration would not confirm how deep the backlog runs, but said that fewer cases are being processed each year after recent office closures and COVID-related court delays. The Office of Rent Administration is a department under the umbrella of the state Department of Homes and Community Renewal.

People gather for a rally protesting rent hikes at City Hall Park on April 28, 2022.

The agency currently has 27 employees who are responsible for processing complaints of illegal overcharges each year.

Teddy Thomas is a frustrated tenant in Harlem who has been waiting since 2019 for a resolution to a complaint he filed after his landlord hiked his rent following the installation of USB ports and LED lighting. But Thomas said that never happened.

Thomas said he has filed complaints in person, messaged the agency’s commissioner on LinkedIn, and even requested public records from the state about his case to find out what happened. None of his attempts were successful, and he has since moved out of his apartment, he said.

With administrative solutions stalled, many tenants have tuned to the courts.

Last month, hundreds of tenants across 11 Harlem buildings whose rent was increased by over $1,500 a month for “individual apartment improvements” — like replacing a stove or toilet — had a class-action suit against their landlords certified.

According to the lawsuit filed by the tenants, the improvements would have had to cost over $83,000 for one tenant to legally justify the monthly rent increases. The landlords didn’t provide evidence of any improvements, the suit states. If the tenants win the lawsuit or reach a settlement, their leases could revert to stabilized rent and some could get paid back for overcharges, according to the tenants’ attorney.

Tenants are getting priced out of their apartments before ORA even reviews their cases, Sam Stein, a housing policy analyst at the Community Service Society of New York, told The News. “What else are they supposed to do?”

“The problem with [the system] is it assumes that tenants know their rights, they have the information that their rights have been violated, and they have the fortitude to go up against their landlord,” Stein said, but they often don’t.

In the meantime, some New Yorkers are clawing at last-ditch efforts like letting landlords try to evict them. John Paraskevopoulos, legislative director for Assemblywoman Gallagher (D-Brooklyn), along with other policy experts said getting assigned a free attorney in housing court is often the quickest way for tenants to get their cases heard.

“But telling people to let the landlord take them to the brink of homelessness?” Paraskevopoulos said. “That should not be our safety net.”

Chairman of Panel Idrees Khattak presided the K-P Assembly session.

Shagufta Malik, who belongs to Awami National Party (ANP), said that ice has spread across the length and breadth of the province. She expressed apprehension that the new generation would be physically and mentally paralyzed if no action against drugs is taken.

“Every other youngster is an addict,” she said, calling it a collective issue which must be referred to the committee for fruitful discussion.

Pakistan People’s Party Parliamentarian (PPPP) MPA Sahibzada Sanaullah seconded these thoughts demanding action against drug peddlers on a war footing.

“Ice is sold like candies outside Universities,” PPP MPA Nighat Orakzai remarked, asking why police had failed to control the menace.

Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) MPA Humayoon Khan said that Malakand is still controlled by the Levies who, he alleged, have links with drug peddlers.

K-P Education Minister Kamran Bangash rejected the allegations, saying the universities are free from narcotics. Terming the use of drugs in educational institutions as propaganda, he added that there was “not a single addict” in the institutions as smoking was also completely banned within their premises.

Focusing on the government’s progress against drug dealers, he said that action has been taken against peddlers as there are strict laws related to ice which can lead to awarding of death sentence.

GEORGIA, USA — Georgia abortion providers are cautiously moving ahead with more leeway to carry out later term abortions after a court ruling Tuesday outlawed the state ‘heartbeat law.’

Although the heartbeat law is no longer legally enforceable in Georgia, abortion providers said the return to full abortion services won’t be immediate.

Before Georgia lawmakers passed the heartbeat bill in 2019, Georgia allowed abortion services under the terms of the 1973 US Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade.

When the Court overturned Roe earlier this year, the heartbeat bill became law which restricted abortions to about six weeks gestation.

Now that a court has overturned the heartbeat law, “it made physicians sigh. Maybe we can return to providing the care that patients deserve,” said Dr. Mimi Zieman, an OB/GYN.

Dr. Zieman was among those in 2019 who asked state lawmakers not to pass the heartbeat bill.

A Planned Parenthood spokeswoman said clinics have been able to return to providing medication abortions for up to eleven weeks’ gestation. But, logistical hurdles are preventing full abortion services, which are up to 20 weeks, from returning quickly. Longer term abortions often require invasive procedures in a clinic.

Dr. Zieman said Georgia abortion providers will get busy quickly.

“Currently, there’s very little access to abortion services across the southeast. I imagine if it’s permissible again in Georgia, that patients would travel from Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee — many neighboring states,” she said.",Q4

Protesters against the event faced off with supporters outside the venue, Old Nick’s Pub, which is named after Satan, and which also holds adult fetish nights.

Some demonstrators on both sides of the roughly 200-strong standoff were armed, police said, including with semi-automatic rifles.

But despite the chaotic scenes outside the pub in Eugene, the event still went ahead - although the child performer, whose stage name is Vanellope MacPherson DuPont, reportedly did not take to the stage as planned.

It has since emerged that a woman who claims to be one of Vanellope’s ‘drag moms’, Kelsey Meta Boren, was charged earlier this year with three child sex offences.

Tense confrontations outside Old Nick's Pub in Oregon, which hosted the drag story event

Some protesters were armed with semi-automatic rifles during the standoff outside the event

Former school employee Boren, 31, who allegedly sent child pornography online, has posted several photos of herself with the girl on Instagram, with some referring to her as ‘my drag kid’.

Boren was arraigned in August and is currently in custody.

Dramatic footage of the protests on Sunday showed angry demonstrators ‘lob projectiles’ including smoke grenades at the rival crowds.

Supporters of the event shouted ‘go home Nazis’ and carried a banner which said: ‘Protect trans youth.’

Meanwhile, counter-protesters had a sign which read: ‘What kind of monster exposes kids to this?’

They also shouted ‘save our children’ at the supporters.

The pub promoted the event by claiming it would show what '11-year-old drag queen could do'

Pedophile suspect Kelsey Boren (pictured with the girl) has said she is Vanellope's 'drag mom'

An earlier Facebook post by the pub to promote the event said: ‘Vanellope is here to show you what an 11-year-old drag queen can do.

‘With all the charm and sweetness of a bowl of sugary cereal, Vanellope is here to brighten up your morning with all her drag talent.’

The post drew a mixture of criticism and support.

A statement posted by Vanellope’s family and friends has claimed the relationship with Boren was strictly ‘professional’ and they only met ‘maybe four or five times’.

The statement added: ‘Meta-Boren was not a family friend, nor was she ever a mentor for V in the drag world.

'They, also, have not had any contact since before covid, and all ties have been severed as of the time of Meta-Boren’s arrest in August.’

Vanellope also has another handler, Sunshine Ray MacPherson - real name Jennifer Hibbs - who is a drag performer.

Hibbs told the Post Millennial: 'Her actual mother does her choreography so that it's all appropriate. We wouldn't let her do anything suggestive… it's terrible that people assume that we would let her do that.'

Hibbs also sought to distance herself and Vanellope from Boren.

Vanellope's minder, Jennifer Hibbs (pictured), who is also a drag performer, said: 'We wouldn't let her do anything suggestive… it's terrible that people assume that we would let her do that'

Old Nick's Pub, which held the drag queen story event, has also held $10-a-night fetish events

The pub has claimed the backlash to drag storytime events a ‘targeted agenda’ to ‘push forward anti-LGBTQ legislation’.

It has also said: 'Drag is an art form. The idea that it is inherently sexual is a form of bigotry.'

Old Nick's has also previously hosted $10-a-ticket fetish nights, with previous events advertising ‘impact play’, ‘rope suspension’ and ‘electric play’.

Eugene Police Department said it created ‘security plans’ for the even prior to it taking place ‘because opposing groups were communicating plans to attend, possibly armed’.

Shouting slogans against the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz-led federal government, the angry protesters blocked main arteries in their respective areas and set fire to old tyres troubling motorists, motorcyclists and commuters.

In Peshawar, dozens of PTI activists blocked the Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway after 3pm. It was closed to traffic until night.

The protesters took to the streets after Jumma prayers.

The PTI activists demonstrated on the Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway only. Smooth flow of vehicular traffic was reported in other parts of the provincial capital.

Spokesman for the government Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif condemned the gun attack on Mr Imran and demanded a probe into the ‘heinous act through a transparent committee’.

In a video message, Mr Saif said those behind the assassination attempt had mistakenly believed that they would frighten the PTI chief and his supporters away with such tactics.

He said interior minister Rana Sanaullah should be interrogated in light of his ‘criminal record’.

Street protests were also staged in Hazara division’s Mansehra, Torghar, Upper and Lower Kohistan districts.

The participants shouted slogans against the PML-N’s government in the centre and demanded an immediate arrest of the brains behind the Imran murder conspiracy.

They also blocked the roads to interchanges of Hazara Motorway by lighting bonfires amid sloganeering.

The speakers said the bid on the life of popular leader Imran Khan was a conspiracy to start ‘armed conflict’ in the country.

They said the PTI would expose those conspirators at the end of the anti-government long march in Islamabad.

The speakers said Mr Imran was striving for the nation’s real freedom and couldn’t be frightened by gun attacks. They said the march on Islamabad would continue until the federal government announced fresh elections in the country.

Local MNAs, MPAs and PTI workers and leaders attended rallies and said they would take revenge from those behind the attack.

The Mingora protest was led by local MNA Saleemur Rehman and city mayor Shahid Khan. Angry protestors burned tyres, blocked roads and said they wouldn’t rest until the culprits were arrested and punished. They also said they would march on Islamabad carrying weapons.

Meanwhile, a protest by PTI activists outside the Mardan Press Club continued for the second consecutive day on Friday.

The participants led by PTI MPAs Abdus Salam Afridi, Iftikhar Ali Mashwani, Tufail Anjum and Zahir Shah Toru shouted slogans against the federal government over attack on their party chief. Carrying party flags, they declared attempt on the life of Imran a cowardly attack.

Dera Ismail Khan also reported the blocking of highways and roads by PTI workers against the Imran gun attack.

Tehsil mayor Umar Amin Khan Gandapur had given the call for street protests.

In a statement, the mayor, who is the brother of former federal minister and PTI leader Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, urged party workers to block roads.

Erie County Judge David Ridge on Wednesday sentenced 20-year-old Abner L. Gonzalez to eight to 23 months in prison, with credit for 223 days he has already served, on his guilty plea on Dec. 5 to a felony count of conspiracy to commit possession with intent to deliver. A misdemeanor count of possession of a controlled substance was dropped by prosecutors as part of the plea deal.

Gonzalez's lawyer, Robert Kinnear, told Ridge that Gonzalez's family had set up a drug rehabilitation program for Gonzalez, who has a drug addiction, to enter in Arizona. Ridge made Gonzalez's successful completion of that program part of his sentence and said Gonzalez may be paroled to go to Arizona to enter the program.

Ridge also sentenced Gonzalez to three years of probation. The overall sentence was close to a standard-range sentence, the judge said.

Erie police charged Gonzalez and filed similar drug charges against three other Arizona residents — Saul Felix, 21; Deontray E. Keomany-Smith, 20; and Kortez L. Murray, 19 — as part of their investigation into the fatal shooting of 30-year-old Erie resident Shannon Crosby on the early morning of Jan. 27. Investigators said Crosby was killed in a shootout that occurred during an attempted home invasion robbery at 3904 McClelland Ave., a short-term rental house where the Arizona men were staying.

Police announced late last week that they had charged four people in connection with Crosby's death. Erie residents Marsea S. Jones, 20; Jamie D. Smith Jr., 20; and Derrick S. Wright, 35; and Lawrence Park Township resident Julia D. Gaerttner, 32, each face criminal homicide, second-degree murder and other offenses in Crosby's death.

The four are being held without bond as they await their preliminary hearings, which are scheduled for Feb. 1, according to online court records.

Felix, Keomany-Smith and Murray are scheduled for trial on their drug cases in early 2023, according to online court records.

Drug dealing preceded the shootout

Erie police charged the four Arizona men with drug offenses based on information they received from Felix when he was interviewed after accompanying Murray to the hospital on Jan. 27. Murray had been shot twice during the confrontation at 3904 McClelland Ave., according to investigators.

Detectives wrote in case documents that Felix told them the Arizona group traveled to Erie to sell fentanyl pills to a local contact for $30,000. Investigators said they also learned the group had arrived in Erie days before the shooting, and that two drug deals had taken place at an apartment complex near the McClelland Avenue rental house.

Few details concerning the confrontation at the residence on the morning of the shooting were released by police or outlined in the criminal complaints filed against the four Arizona men. But new details emerged in the complaints filed on Dec. 8 against the four homicide suspects.

Detectives wrote in the complaints that Felix told them the Arizona group was inside the McClelland Avenue residence when several males wearing black clothing and ski masks and carrying guns kicked open the door and opened fire on them. Felix said one of the suspects grabbed him by his hair and dragged him into the kitchen with a gun to his head, according to the complaints.

He told detectives that Murray returned fire during the confrontation.

Investigators said they found numerous shell casings of different calibers at the house following the shooting, but did not find a significant amount of suspected drugs.

'I've been able to work on myself'

Kinnear told Ridge at Wednesday's sentencing that Gonzalez was not involved in setting up the drug deal in Erie, but went along with the others. He said Gonzalez has a drug addiction, and that basically he was paid with drugs to come with the others to Erie.

Kinnear also said that Gonzalez was high at the time of the shooting, and that he was in a bedroom in the rental house.

Gonzalez told Ridge that being in prison hasn't been easy, but ""I've been able to work on myself, better myself.""

Gonzalez has been in prison since May 5, when he was picked up in Arizona on the Erie police charges, officials said in court. Gonzalez was brought back to Erie and was arraigned and placed in the Erie County Prison on July 9.

First Assistant District Attorney Jessica Reger told Ridge that while Gonzalez is a victim in the home invasion robbery and shooting, it doesn't change what he did in being involved in bringing drugs into Erie.

""I will hope this is maybe an eye-opening situation for him,"" she said.

Ridge told Gonzalez that by pleading guilty to the conspiracy to commit possession with intent to deliver charge, it meant that he was in agreement with people who were selling drugs that are killing people. He also told Gonzalez that he was lucky he didn't die that night.

""This is a serious matter,"" the judge said. ""You contributed to a deadly situation in our community.""

Assange is being persecuted for one reason and one reason alone: He revealed the truth about the actions of the American government abroad, the same government that represents the corporations that exploit us here in the United States.

One of the most significant initial exposures by WikiLeaks was a video, released in 2010, depicting the US Army killing unarmed civilians and journalists in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. The footage was filmed three years earlier, in 2007, in the early years of the US occupation of Iraq. I urge all of you to watch this video, which is titled “Collateral Murder.”

Collateral Murder

The video was followed by the release of the Iraq and Afghan war logs in 2010 and the Guantanamo files in 2011. These documents, which were made available to the public thanks to the heroic actions of whistleblower Chelsea Manning, exposed a lie that is central to the propaganda of the US government, Democrat and Republican alike: that the wars abroad are about defending democracy.

For this reason, Assange has been subjected to more than a decade of vicious and uninterrupted persecution. He is currently in London’s Belmarsh maximum-security prison, where he recently contracted COVID-19. The UK High Court ruled late last year that he could be extradited to the US, even though the trial itself revealed that the CIA had plotted to kidnap and murder him.

Beyond his personal fate, there are two critical issues for workers in the defense of Assange.

First, the persecution of Assange is an attack on basic democratic rights, including the First Amendment right to free speech and a free press. Assange is guilty of telling us the truth, of exposing lies that the government does not want exposed.

The corporations and the wealthy in this country depend on a bought-and-paid-for media, which parrots whatever the government tells them. We experience this every day, when workers are denounced in the media for our efforts to secure a decent wage and a future for ourselves and our families. If an individual can be jailed and prosecuted for revealing true information, it sets a dangerous precedent that will be used against any worker who speaks out and opposes the demands of the corporations, aided and abetted by the union apparatus.

Second, Assange has helped to expose the reality of American militarism. How much money has been spent and how many lives lost, including of US soldiers, to wage endless war abroad? And for what? They throw around words like “democracy” and “freedom” to convince workers that these wars are worth the cost, but the reality is that they are about securing the domination of American corporations over the entire globe. More than 1 million Iraqis and Afghans have died to achieve this end.

The consequences of these wars are felt by all of us. More than $1 trillion is expended on the US military every year, while they claim that no money is available to provide decent living conditions for workers. One veteran kills him or herself every 80 minutes in the US, the consequence of post-traumatic stress disorder from what they saw and experienced at war. As soon as their bodies are no longer useful to the ruling class, veterans are essentially discarded by the government.

Now, the Biden administration is escalating a conflict with Russia that Biden himself said last week could lead to “Armageddon”—that is, the annihilation of the entire planet in nuclear war. And what is this all about? The government of Vladimir Putin represents the oligarchs in Russia, and the invasion of Ukraine must be opposed by all workers. However, this invasion was a response to the expansion of the US-led NATO military alliance up to Russia’s borders and the massive armament of Ukraine by the US.

Everything that the media tells us about this war is a lie. It is not a war about “democracy.” Ukraine’s government is comprised of neo-Nazis who praise people who helped carry out the Holocaust during World War Two. The oligarchs who run Ukraine recently passed a labor law eliminating the right of millions of workers to collectively bargain. You won’t hear that on the nightly news.

The same military-industrial complex that provoked the war in Iraq is escalating war against Russia today, but on an even larger and more dangerous scale. The US banks and corporations are fighting to control Eastern Europe at the expense of their Russian rivals. The US ruling elite is prepared to make the working class suffer greatly, and even sacrifice millions of lives, to expand the domination of American corporations.

Workers in the US and throughout the world have no interest in the war. We have the same interests as workers in Russia, Ukraine and in every country. We are exploited by the same corporations. We confront the same problems. We will suffer the same consequences if the catastrophe of nuclear war is not prevented.

Workers should know that the labor movement has a long and proud tradition of defending democratic rights, as these rights are critical for all workers. It should also be recalled that the UAW withdrew from the AFL-CIO in 1968 in opposition to the Vietnam War. The fact that the trade unions no longer even raise these critical issues is part of the same process that has led to their domination by a privileged apparatus that serves the interests of the companies.

For these reasons, it is critical that all workers take a stand in defense of Julian Assange. It will not be through appeals to the ruling elite and their politicians that his freedom will be secured, but only through our intervention. We must connect the fight to defend our interests with the defense of Assange, the defense of democratic rights, and opposition to war.

Sincerely,

Will Lehman",Q4

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — A Florida driver in a fit of road range fired a shot at an SUV that passed him, not realizing it was a marked sheriff's patrol vehicle, authorities said Thursday.

Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office Deputy Daniel Henry was driving home Wednesday night on a dark two-lane road near Tampa when the car ahead of him started hitting the brakes “aggressively,” the agency said in a news release.

Henry decided to pass the car, but when he did the driver fired a shot, striking the SUV near the back. Henry, who was not hurt, pulled over and broadcast a description of the driver and the car.

Another deputy soon spotted the car, which he followed to a home, where he arrested Tracy Swint, 49. the sheriff's office said. It reported that Swint confessed, saying he fired the shot because of road rage but denied knowing the other driver was a law enforcement officer.

Swint is charged with aggravated battery on a law enforcement officer and shooting into an occupied vehicle. He was being held Thursday on $22,000 bond. Court records do not list an attorney for Swint.",Q4

Israel held its fifth election in less than four years. (AP Photo/Oded Balilty)

(RNS) — Alarm bells have been clanging loudly in the White House and among some American Jews in the wake of the recent Israeli election, which virtually assured former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s return to office, after a hiatus of more than a year. The prime fuel of this trepidation is the fact that Netanyahu’s victory was made possible by the Religious Zionism Party, headed by two nationalist firebrands, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir.

Ben-Gvir in particular has a reputation for Arab-baiting, causing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, according to Axios, to hint to Israeli President Isaac Hertzog that the U.S. will refuse to work with Ben-Gvir.

Ben-Gvir, who was found guilty by an Israeli court of incitement in 2007 for carrying signs that read things like, “Expel the Arab enemy,” insists his animus isn’t aimed at Arab citizens of good will but only at people who seek to harm other citizens or betray the country.





Shortly before the election, he told The New York Times that he had “no problem, of course, with the minorities here” — only with “whoever is a terrorist, whoever commits terror.” He has also sought to distance himself from Meir Kahane, the anti-Arab firebrand who was assassinated by an Egyptian terrorist in 1990 and whom Ben-Gvir once called his hero.

RELATED: Israel’s Haredi voters drift hard right in leadership vacuum

Whether Ben-Gvir will live up to his boogeyman reputation or prove to have evolved into a responsible, if zealous, statesman remains to be seen, but Ben-Gvir may not be entirely in control of how he and his party are perceived: “Religious Zionism” is also a movement, an amalgam of religion and politics, and those in Israel who identify with it are fiercely nationalistic, extol army service and are strongly supportive of “the settlements” — Jewish towns and enclaves in the contested West Bank — and promote the establishment of more of them.

Ben-Gvir’s presence in the new government is likely to add to a common misunderstanding outside Israel about the two Haredi parties — often called “ultra-Orthodox” — that have long been part of Netanyahu’s governing coalitions: Shas and United Torah Judaism. These two parties are ideologically opposed to Israeli nationalism, shun army service and are ambivalent about settlements.

The confusion isn’t limited to the unschooled public. In 2000, The New York Times characterized Yigal Amir, who had assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin five years earlier, as “ultra-religious.” Amir was not by any measure Haredi, however, but rather a religious nationalist. His contemptible act of murder was motivated by politics, specifically, Rabin’s participation in the Oslo Accords, which promised, among other things, Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.

Far from agreeing with malefactors such as Amir, Rabbi Elazar Menachem Man Shach, the late founder of one of the smaller Haredi parties that now comprise United Torah Judaism, strongly opposed the establishment of West Bank settlements and endorsed Rabin’s “land for peace” vision. His Sephardic counterpart, the late founder of the Shas party, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, did not oppose the Oslo Accords and in 1992 joined the Rabin government.





The Haredi parties’ priorities are not territorial or nationalist; they are focused almost entirely on religious and economic issues — things like maintaining longstanding religious practices at Jewish holy places; preserving curbs on public transportation on the Jewish Sabbath and government stipends for full-time yeshiva students and religious institutions. Haredi leaders have forbidden their followers from ascending the Temple Mount, a provocation embraced by some Religious Zionists.

Traditionally, Israel’s religious parties have held that lives are more important than territory.

Certainly, there are Haredim who personally oppose negotiations with the Palestinians or the relinquishing of any territory captured by Israel in 1967. Because they ally with Netanyahu, who champions their religious agenda, the Haredi parties indirectly support the Likud government’s nationalist policies.

More concerning for proponents of actively pursuing a peace process, some younger Haredim have been adopting Religious Zionism attitudes, promising continuing hostility between Arab and Jewish Israelis.

But established Haredi politicians have a record of reaching out to Arab Israeli citizens. In a Knesset speech a year ago, the United Torah Judaism party’s Moshe Gafni stressed the need for “weaker” parts of Israeli society — Haredim and Arabs — to band together. In the wake of a recent spike in Palestinian attacks in cities inside Israel, including the Haredi town of Bnei Brak, United Torah Judaism’s Yisrael Eichler reiterated that Israel’s Arab population are full citizens and need to be treated as such.

This past April, in fact, Bnei Brak decided to honor the memory of an Arab police officer, Amir Khoury, who was killed while apprehending a terrorist, by naming a street after him. Khoury’s father, Jeries, said that “a very strong connection has developed between us and the Haredi community in Bnei Brak, including rabbis and religious figures … They all came to the funeral and to console us.”

Israel’s new policy on ‘kosher cellphones’ is an abomination for Haredi rabbis

Politically and religiously liberal American Jews have cause to grumble over the outcome of the recent election. Issues such as religious standards at the Western Wall, the Israeli Rabbinate’s control over marriages and other life-cycle events and whether public transportation should respect the Jewish Sabbath will, under the new government, be approached from a Haredi viewpoint.

But when it comes to the issue of Jewish-Palestinian relations and the hope for an eventual resumption of a peace process, the vast majority of Haredim, even if their political parties end up joining a government that includes the likes of the Religious Zionism Party, do not drink at the well of harsh nationalism or racism and should be correctly understood as devoted to a religious ideal, not a political one.

Chris Hedges: Israel & the Rise of a New Fascism

The mask is being lifted from the face of Israel’s apartheid state, exposing a grinning death’s head that portends the obliteration of the few restraints against killing Palestinians.

Benjamin Netanyahu’s proposed coalition government of Jewish extremists, fanatic Zionists and religious bigots represents a seismic change in Israel, one that will exacerbate Israel’s pariah status, erode external support for Israel, fuel a third Palestinian uprising, or intifada, and create irreconcilable political divides within the Jewish state.

Alon Pinkas, writing in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, calls the coalition government, scheduled to take power in one or two weeks:

“a kakistocracy extraordinaire: government by the worst and least suitable collection of ultranationalists, Jewish supremacists, anti-democrats, racists, bigots, homophobes, misogynists, corrupt and allegedly corrupt politicians. A ruling coalition of 64 lawmakers, of whom 32 are either ultra-Orthodox or religious Zionist. Certainly not a coalition Zeev Jabotinsky, the father of Revisionist Zionism, or Menachem Begin, the founder of Likud, could have ever imagined.”

Itamar Ben-Gvir, from the ultra-nationalist Otzma Yehudit, “Jewish Power,” party, will be the new minister for internal security. Otzma Yehudit is populated with members of Rabbi Meir Kahane’s Kach party, which was banned from running for the Knesset in 1988 for espousing a “Nazi-like ideology” that included advocating the ethnic cleansing of all Palestinian citizens of Israel as well as all Palestinians living under Israeli military occupation.

Ben-Gvir’s appointment, along with that of other far-right ideologues, including Bezalel Smotrich, to be in charge of the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), effectively jettisons the old tropes liberal Zionists used to defend Israel — that it is the only democracy in the Middle East, that it seeks a peaceful settlement with the Palestinians in a two-state solution, that extremism and racism have no place in Israeli society and that Israel must impose draconian forms of control on the Palestinians to prevent terrorism.

Oslo Called ‘An Act of Treason’

Ben-Gvir and Smotrich represent the dregs of Israeli society, one that promotes “Jewish identity” and “Jewish nationalism” in a Zionist version of fascism’s call for blood and soil. They are Israel’s equivalent of Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene. Their Religious Zionist bloc is now the third largest in the Knesset.

Ben-Gvir, who was rejected for army service because of his extremism, stole a hood ornament from Yitzak Rabin’s car a few weeks before the then-prime minister was assassinated in 1995 by Jewish extremist, Yigal Amir. Amir, like many far-right Israelis, including arguably Netanyahu himself, considered Rabin’s support for the Oslo Accords to be an act of treason. “We got to his car, and we’ll get to him too,” Ben-Gvir said at the time.

He calls for the deportation of Palestinians who confront Israeli soldiers; followers of the anti-Zionist ultra-Orthadox Netueri Karta movement; as well as Israeli-Arab Knesset member Ayman Odeh and the anti-Zionist Marxist Knesset member Ofer Cassif, who is Jewish.

Codifying Jewish Supremacy

The old tropes Israel employed to justify itself were always more fiction than reality. Israel long ago became an apartheid state. It directly controls through its illegal Jewish-only settlements, restricted military zones and army compounds, over 60 percent of the West Bank and has de facto control over the rest.

There are 65 laws that directly or indirectly discriminate against Palestinian citizens of Israel and those living in the OPT.

The old tropes are being replaced by screed-filled diatribes that paint Palestinians and Arabs (Muslim and Christian) as contaminants and an existential threat to Israel. This hate speech is accompanied by a vicious internal campaign to silence Jewish “traitors,” especially those who are liberal or left-wing and secular.

An Otzma Yehudit-run autocracy will shut down democratic debate, eviscerate the protections of civil society and further codify what has long been reality — Jewish supremacy and the ongoing ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their own land that dates back to the founding of Israel in the 1940s.

The once unthinkable is now thinkable, such as formally annexing large sections of the West Bank, including “Area C” where up to 300,000 Palestinians live.

The killing of about 140 Palestinians this year, including the American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, is the worst death toll since 2006 (not including major escalations of violence such as Israeli bombardments of Gaza). It has been accompanied by Palestinian attacks that have left 30 Israelis dead.



The Horrors to Come

The new government will accelerate these killings along with house and school demolitions, expulsions of Palestinians from East Jerusalem, the uprooting of Palestinian olive orchards, mass imprisonment and the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. The totality of these crimes amounts to the international crime of genocide, the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights explained in 2016.

Gaza, the world’s largest open-air prison, will continue to be more frequently bombed and shelled. Its infrastructure, including its water, electrical and sewage systems, as well as fuel storage facilities, will be targeted for obliteration. Gazans and their fellow Palestinians in the West Bank will be subject to ever tightening blockades, reducing them to a level of subsistence that will be one step above starvation. Instead of attempting to cover up the murder of Palestinians by Jewish settlers and the Israeli army, the new government will openly celebrate the atrocities.

After the recent execution of an unarmed Palestinian who was shot three times at point-blank range and then again while on the ground by an Israeli border policeman during a scuffle was captured on video, in which Ben-Gvir called the officer a “hero.”

Netanyahu, who is charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three corruption cases, is determined to politicize the judiciary. He and his coalition partners will further curtail the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel who are already second-class citizens.

They will continue to push aggressively for a war with Iran. They will support efforts to seize the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, which Jewish Israelis call the Temple Mount, the supposed site of the Second Temple, destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. Jewish extremists have long called for the Al-Aqsa mosque, the third holiest shrine for Muslims, to be torn down and replaced by a “Third” Jewish temple, a move that would set the Muslim world alight.

Ben-Gvir, who considers Baruch Goldstein, the Jewish settler who in 1994 massacred 29 Muslims worshipers in Hebron, “a hero,” has announced an imminent visit along with other Jewish extremists to the site of the mosque. When Ariel Sharon, then Israel’s opposition leader, went to the mosque site in September 2000, it ignited the Second Intifada.

I wish this was conjecture. It isn’t. It is what these fanatics advocate.

Avigdor Maoz of the extremist Noam Party, which opposes LGBTQ rights and wants to ban women from serving in the military, has been appointed to oversee the Israeli school curriculum, Russian immigration and national Jewish identity.

“Anyone who tries to harm real Judaism is the darkness,” he said last week. “Anyone who tries to create a new so-called liberal religion is the darkness. Anyone who — with intentional concealment and obfuscation — tries to brainwash the children of Israel with their agendas, without the knowledge of the parents, is the darkness.”

Counter to American Jews’ Values

Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of the liberal Zionist advocacy organization, J Street, said in a public statement that Israel’s next government “seems likely to take more actions that run counter to the values that American Jews teach our children are the essence of Jewish identity,” including support for civil rights, the labor movement, the women’s movement and LGBTQ freedoms.

“How can we explain to our children and our grandchildren, let alone to ourselves, that these values are the core of the Jewish identity, but the state of the Jewish people is denying another people their rights and equality and undercutting the rule of international law?” he asked.

“This is a fundamental crisis that looms over our community in the coming years. Those in the establishment of our community who insist that Jewish America must stand united and unquestioningly loyal to Israel no matter what are doing a deep, deep, disservice to the health of the Jewish community.”

After the 1967 war that saw Israel invade and annex Egypt’s Sinai peninsula, Syria’s Golan Heights and Palestine’s Gaza and the West Bank, Israelis frequented Palestinian territory to shop, eat at restaurants, spend the weekend in the desert oasis of Jericho or get their cars fixed by Palestinian mechanics.

https://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/story/47022/20221209/animal-welfare-advocates-ask-hochul-to-sign-puppy-mill-ban,Animal welfare advocates ask Hochul to sign puppy mill ban,"Animal welfare advocates are asking Governor Kathy Hochul to sign a bill that would ban the sale of puppies, kittens and rabbits from so-called puppy mills, which opponents say use inhumane practices to breed pets for sale in pet stores.

The bill, which passed nearly unanimously in the State Legislature, would end the sale of animals who are bred in “mills,” large-scale commercial breeding facilities that keep animals in substandard conditions while mass producing them for sale.

Libby Post, the executive director of the New York State Animal Protection Federation, which represents animal shelters and rescue operations, says the female breeder dogs are housed in isolated cages and forced to produce several litters a year. She says the animals suffer physical and psychological damage.

“It’s an inhumane situation,” Post said. “New York is complicit in animal abuse for as long as we allow pet stores to sell animals from these mills.”

The bill also allows pet stores to “rebrand” as ethical purveyors of animals and instead offer pets from animal shelters or rescue organizations for adoption.

Post says Americans spend $183 billion dollars a year on their pets, with 98% of that on food and accessories. She says just 2% of sales involve live animals, as pet owners have moved away from buying animals from the stores.

“Educated consumers are saying no to this,” Post said. “New York should not be in business of propping up a dying business model.”

The measure does not prevent someone from buying a specific breed of dog or cat, or a rabbit, from a reputable breeder, where the potential buyer can visit and see for themselves how the animals are treated.

California and Maryland have enacted similar bans. In Illinois, after a ban was approved, a chain of pet stores closed, citing the new law as the reason.

A national lobbying group for pet store owners is urging retail shop owners in New York who sell puppies and kittens to persuade Hochul to veto the bill. A form letter provided by the Pet Advocacy Network says that the bill would limit some rights and legal protections for pet owners. The letter also says that the pet store owners only buy from reputable breeders and that their shop would likely have to close if the measure becomes law.

Hochul has until the end of the month to decide whether to sign or veto the measure. She has not said what she will do.",Q4

TOOELE — A Pleasant Grove man has pleaded guilty to murder, admitting to shooting and killing his ex-girlfriend, the mother of his child.

Brandon Scott Zipperle, 29, was charged with aggravated murder, but an Oct. 4 plea deal downgraded the charge to murder, which is also a first-degree felony. The deal also included dismissing two counts of obstructing justice and one count of possession of a weapon by a restricted person, all second-degree felonies.

In a statement in support of the plea, Zipperle admitted to ""knowingly and intentionally"" causing Brooklyn Elise Odland Tyree's death.

Zipperle picked up Tyree, 23, of Salt Lake City, and their 7-month-old baby, at Tyree's apartment on May 3. Charging documents say he then took the woman to Five Mile Pass, shot her and hid her body.

Tyree's body was found three days later by a father and son recreating in the area. Police found the child safe with Zipperle.

Zipperle is set to be sentenced on Feb. 9. For the first-degree felony murder charge, the anticipated sentence is between 15 years and life in prison.

His fiancée, Elizabeth Anne Ludwig, was charged with three counts of obstructing justice, a second-degree felony, and accused of pawning the firearm that Zipperle used. Ludwig is being held at the Tooele County Jail, pending charges.",Q4

LOS ANGELES, CA, UNITED STATES, October 20, 2022 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Oct the 3rd, in Rome, Italy, two-time Fulbright recipient Megan Euker presented to the Fulbright Commission her project which combines a wide variety of professional disciplines and students’ interests. These fields include art, medicine, law, and biomimicry (the emulation of the models, systems, and elements of nature for the purpose of solving complex human problems).

Euker has written and piloted over thirty different courses across six departments at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago and other institutions. She will now be instructing at the Fine Arts Academy in Siracusa, Italy (also known as Mediterranean Arts and Design —MADE) through April 2023.

As a Fulbright Ambassador, Euker’s research work in Italy is focusing on rare diseases, also known as Orphan Diseases. These illnesses are often abandoned as researchers race to make what they deem easier profits with other diseases which have larger patient populations. Specifically, through her work with San Rocco Therapeutics (“SRT”), she has been targeting the blood disorders Sickle Cell Disease and its cousin disease Thalassemia.

Megan, who is Italian-American and speaks the language fluently, met Patrick Girondi in 2016. Mr. Girondi is the founder of San Rocco Therapeutics, a gene therapy company working on the cure for Sickle Cell Disease and Thalassemia. Girondi’s son is afflicted with Thalassemia.

Euker’s project is titled “Sangue Tira,” Italian for “blood pulls.” Megan went on to elucidate that “Upon learning about (Girondi’s) company, their gene therapy for Sickle Cell Disease and Thalassemia, and a father’s quest to cure his son, I immediately became invested in the project. Mr. Girondi pointed me to a New York Times article published in 2015 about his company’s ongoing battle to retrieve their therapy to cure Sickle Cell Disease and Thalassemia, and I decided this case was the piece of the puzzle connecting my artistic talent with medicine: to use art to help people with orphan diseases.”

Euker consulted for SRT for 4 years during their major court battle with Bluebird Bio in the New York Supreme Court. She eventually landed a management position with the company.

Elaborating on her future plans, Euker stated “For the research portion of my project, I will integrate myself into the Italian health system, hospitals, and patient centers, particularly those with connections to SRT in the south of Italy that serve as the model for my advocacy in the United States.”

Upon return to the USA, Euker will present an exhibition of her students’ designed medical object work from Sicily, Chicago (SAIC), and Tampa (USF) at the International Museum of Surgical Science in Chicago, which will be the third exhibition she has curated at the museum. She also exhibited her own work about SRT’s court case and gene therapy at the museum, “THE CURE.” https://imss.org/megan-euker-the-cure/

Euker added, “Building on my existing connections in the U.S., the academic and professional relationships I forge in Italy will become part of a wider and more consequential network.”

https://www.gulftoday.ae/news/2022/11/12/pakistani-man-sentenced-to-death-for-killing-ex-wife-from-america,Pakistani man sentenced to death for killing ex-wife from America,"The ex-husband of an American woman of Pakistani origin was convicted of murdering her as part of a property dispute and sentenced to death Saturday by a Pakistani court.

The district court in Rawalpindi also sentenced Rizwan Habib's father and an employee to seven years in prison for abetting the murder of 47-year-old Wajiha Swati, a lawyer said. The court acquitted three other suspects for lack of evidence.

Shabnam Naz, attorney for the victim, said Judge Muhammad Afzal Majuka announced in open court the results of the yearlong trial. Naz said Habib was given the death sentence for murdering his former wife last October. She was killed in Habib's home in the district of Lakki Marwat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Habib was also convicted of kidnapping Swati and sentenced to 10 years in prison.

Habib’s father and another relative were each sentenced to seven years in prison for abetting the kidnapping and murder. Three other suspects — employees of Habib — were acquitted for lack of sufficient evidence, said Naz.

Defence attorney Talat Mahmood Zaid, who represented Habib and the other suspects, said he will appeal the conviction and sentencing to a higher court.

Swati, the mother of three sons, arrived in Pakistan on Oct. 16, 2021 to take possession of the former couple's home in a posh neighbourhood of Islamabad but disappeared. She and Habib were divorced in November 2020 and Swati lived in Columbus, Ohio and later bought a house in New York, her attorney said.

Swati's son Abdullah Mahdi filed a complaint with police after his calls to his mother in Pakistan went unanswered. During a subsequent investigation, U.S. Embassy officials contacted local police for help in finding Swati. Police questioned Habib, who was the last person to see her - at the airport on her arrival.

Habib later confessed that he abducted Swati at the airport and murdered her the next day. He told investigators he buried Swati's body at his home in Lakki Marwat. Habib subsequently led the police to the crime scene where they exhumed Swati’s body in December last year.

Habib was Swati's second husband. She married him after her first husband, a cardiologist, was murdered in Pakistan.

""To me this evil man planned this whole game after getting closer to Wajiha Swati who was some 15 year older than him,” said Naz, the attorney.

https://www.frontpagemag.com/dutch-interview-with-raymond-ibrahim-defender-of-the-west/,"Dutch Interview with Raymond Ibrahim, Defender of the West","Note: Last spring, Raymond Ibrahim, a Shillman Fellow at the Freedom Center, did an extensive interview with the subscription-only Dutch magazine, PAL NWS. It follows. Text in bold belongs to Sonja Dahlmans, who conducted the interview; non-bolded text is Ibrahim’s.

Mr. Ibrahim is an expert in Islamic history, more specifically, the military history of the Middle East. He is an American of Egyptian decent; his family are Coptic Christians who left Egypt to the United States, before he was born, in the hopes of a better life, away from discrimination and growing fanaticism. Mr. Ibrahim is the author of many books, such as Crucified Again and Sword and Scimitar. His latest book, Defenders of the West will be published this July.

Jihadism in Africa

Just recently the United States took Nigeria off of its blacklist of ‘Countries of Particular Concern.’ What is your view on this?

The situation in Nigeria started around 2010 with Boko Haram and others, targeting Christians. The United States would not put the country on their blacklist, especially not while Hillary Clinton was head of the State Department. She was very much criticized for this. Even her husband, Bill Clinton, tried to whitewash the persecution, apparently because their Clinton Foundation had some sort of business ventures in Nigeria. So they were minimizing what was happening in Nigeria. Bill Clinton said that “all this stuff,” with which he meant chopping people’s heads off and burning churches, “is a by-product of economics and the ‘haves’ versus the ‘haves-not.’” This went on for a long time; they did not list Nigeria on the blacklist. Finally, the last year of the Trump administration, in 2020, they did, but now they have taken it off again, one year later. Even though it is by far the nation with the highest number of Christians slaughtered around the world. It is really inexplicable.

Last year, 2020, I believe around 4200 Christians worldwide were killed for their faith, half of those victims, 2000, were from Nigeria alone. It makes you wonder why the United States does not consider this a ‘Country of Particular Concern’ anymore?

Because they keep trying to make it sound as if the people that are being killed are not persecuted for their Christian faith. What they do, for example, is highlight how Boko Haram might have killed a Muslim, too. But if you are a Muslim living among Christians you are not considered, in their mind, a real Muslim. Then the media use this to claim the violence has nothing to do with religion because a Muslim also died. People will buy into that narrative.

The role the media play

What I notice here in newspapers and other media is that reporters use the idea of the Fulani as herdsmen, so they will claim the butchering of Christians that is now going on, is due to an agricultural dispute over landownership or something like that.

Yes, right. Christians are farmers who live off the land and the Muslims are the Fulani herdsmen who take their flocks or cattle; they want grazing land, so it is portrayed as a territorial dispute. The problem with this, however, is that almost every time it happens Christians are getting hacked and Muslims, the “herdsmen,” are screaming “Allahu Akbar.” They are cutting off heads and justifying it by the use of Islamic slogans—so is it merely a land dispute or is there (obviously) something more going on?

I remember that during some of these attacks, Christians have actually been taken out of churches and were killed while the attackers shouted “Allahu Akbar.”

Yes, recently in Mozambique, they beheaded a pastor and gave his wife the head to go and give it to the police. Another point that I would like to make is that what is happening in Nigeria is spilling all over Sub-Saharan Africa.

You mean countries such as Mali, Burkina Faso and Nigeria?

Everywhere: In Mozambique, Mali, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo. In Congo they have a group called the Allied Democratic Forces which has the word “democratic” in its name but it largely consists of ISIS-affiliated jihadists who terrorize and decapitate the people of that Christian-majority nation. People think that these are different issues, but when you really look at it, they are all close and a lot of these Islamic groups work together. They are often connected; they are definitely connected in ideology, which says a lot.

Another thing is that Nina Shea from the Hudson Institute, former USCRIF, said that the United States government now blames what is happening in Nigeria to climate change. That these killings and abductions are rooted in climate change.

I hear this all the time; they always come up with materialistic excuses because the leftist mentality refuses to accept that religion—especially not Islam—is or could be a factor. Therefore it must be about “equality,” maybe even “racism,” even though it is happening in Africa—who knows, as the leftist mentally has become increasingly more illogical. They will use anything they can from their arsenal of excuses to justify what is happening, including, of course, “climate change.”

Around 6000 ISIS jihadists returned to West-Africa from Iraq and Syria. This includes most of the countries that you have just named, like Nigeria, Mali, Niger et cetera. Why is this hardly ever mentioned in the main stream media, in your opinion?

Because it goes against what they want you to believe or even think about. They do not want you to hear about how Christians are daily butchered for their religion. So, how can they get away from mentioning it? One of the worst examples that I can remember, was when 21 Copts were beheaded in Libya (2015). That was considered to be one of the worst and most notorious instances of Muslim persecution of Christians, not least because it was very vivid. At the same time in the United States a gorilla was killed in a zoo. Someone did the analysis and apparently that specific incident got around six times more coverage than the story of the 21 Coptic Christian men that were decapitated by ISIS in Libya. Imagine, a gorilla that got shot because something happened in a zoo gets six times more media coverage than 21 men getting their heads carved off because they refused to change their faith. The point is, the media work very hard, there is a vision of a world that they want people to believe in. If there is something out there that goes against that vision or worldview, well, the best thing to do is to ignore it. Then, if you really have to talk about it—as they did with the 21 Christians, as it was deemed “newsworthy” enough—then you come up with all those excuses (grievances, hijacking Islam), anything so it’s not about the obvious, namely, Muslims persecuting Christians.

For example, in Nigeria, whenever there is a dramatic Islamic attack on Christians that claims dozens of lives, then the media will mention it, but only in the context of the “authorized” narrative: “Well, it is because the Fulani are impoverished, it is about economics.” That is their way of doing damage control. Their first approach is to ignore it; if, however, that particular attack is “sensational” enough to warrant reporting, they do so but only under the secularist or materialist narrative. Moreover, whenever they can find something that helps them—let’s say a Christian that attacks a Muslim (almost always in reprisal)—then it will be all over the news. That is their way of neutralizing or making everything “even.” This way they can say: “See, it is the same thing.”

Remember the recent attack in England (Liverpool) that man who wanted to attack the cathedral? It was a big story, because they could say he was a Christian. Then they found out that he was going to the mosque frequently and the story fell away.

Refugee crisis in Europe

With Europe’s current refugee crisis, you would expect that what is going on right now in Africa would get a lot of attention, from the media, politicians, because it could worsen the flood of refugees coming to Europe. In Nigeria alone there are already over one million displaced people. At some point this too will become a problem for Europe; can they afford ignoring what happens in Africa?

If you look at how things are progressing, look at Europe now, I don’t know the exact numbers, but France, Germany and England have the largest population of migrants, certainly of Muslims in general. For some Muslims, this is a “demographic jihad”—or as some call it, the “jihad of the womb”—because Muslims tend to have many more children, not least because they have more wives too. What is happening in these Western European countries that have large Muslim populations is reminiscent of a non-stop headache. Look at France, Germany too. I recently wrote an article about Muslims attacking the Christian cross: apart from the Islamic world itself, these two European nations also have a large amount of these sorts of attacks. Obviously, nobody ever seems to know why and constantly seek for “motives.” It must be those Buddhists again [laughs]. So, obviously this will continue. I predict it will get much worse; what we are seeing now is just the beginning.

I saw a poll that said that in 2050 more than half of Europe’s population will be Muslim. Just by migration and birth rate. In some countries, for years already, the number one name for baby boys is Muhammad. I think people are just habituated and trained not to think of the long term. That is how the concept of “news” seems to work; just think about what is happening now. They don’t reflect on what is going to happen in the long term. I think deep down inside a lot of people are very nihilistic and they think they are old, or getting old, and by the time something really bad happens they will be dead, so it’s not their problem. They don’t think about their children, quite possibly because they don’t have children. I think there is a lot of fatalism in Europe about the whole situation.

The Dutch minister of Immigration and Migration (Ankie Boekers-Knol) said it was a given, that we are going to have more floods of refugees in the future.

The thing is, you will, but you can put a stop to it. Countries like Poland and Hungary do not allow it. You can do that, but they won’t—that’s the whole thing. It is not inevitable, it can be stopped, but they don’t want to stop it.

Wokism

With regard to ignoring what is going on in Africa right now, jihad spreading all over the continent, what is your opinion on Western projects -funding projects- in these developing countries? For example, projects to help girls to get an education. In many of the countries we have just spoke about, schools for both boys and girls had to close down because of the threat of jihadist violence or abduction of schoolchildren. It would seem that is the biggest threat right now that needs urgent attention, not these projects?

Well, the educational programs that they fund are really teaching or indoctrinating children in wokist ideology, that’s it. That is why it is okay to shut—or burn—down a Christian school; they don’t care about that fact. They will give money to another education centre because it is a whole different education. It is part of the general brainwashing going on around the world.

Does this include the idea that North Africa, when it was colonized, Christianity was forced upon them? While many people there actually know that this is not true and that they were Christian before they became Islamic. Would this be the message they will learn in these projects?

Absolutely. These messages are at their core anti-Judaeo-Christian. Christianity in fact was spread rather peacefully in North Africa and the Middle East. Islam came with the sword, killing people, giving them three choices: to embrace Islam, to pay the jizya or to die. Everyone used to know that, until recently; now it is a different story.

Now the “bad guy” is almost always a Christian. You see this for example in movies, on tv, these so called historical movies, when they are set in medieval times. The bad guy, the hypocrite, the most despicable character, is going to be the one carrying a large cross. The good guy is going to be a much “nuanced” person, secular minded. Of course such depictions are beyond anachronistic and have nothing to do with reality. It is not only in movies; books and education in general is all about demonizing Christianity, which is basically another way of saying Western civilization. At the same time they uphold and promote anything and everyone else, for example Islam.

This is why we in America Black Lives Matter (BLM). In America the whole idea of wokism is about one word: racism. Everything about Europe is racist, European history is governed by racist Europeans doing bad things to non-white people. That is really how history is now understood, especially among young people who are “woke.” Of course, with history you can do anything you want, including ignore the constants but then find one aberration and focus on that. That is what they do, this is spreading around. This seems to be part of the whole globalization project. The globalists, the elites, are trying to get everyone to believe in the same narrative. This will help them to distribute people all around the world and do what they’re going to do—dilute Europe especially. It is pretty sinister, actually, and is being used to demoralize Europeans and people. It is used to embolden the opposite.

Which it does?

Exactly. It does that here in America, Europe and it is doing the same all over the non-Western world.

The Netherlands plans to give millions to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to keep the United Nations personnel that is still there safe.

Jizya money.

The dhimmi returns?

That is what jizya is. It is a tribute so you won’t kill us.

People in these European countries or in America, everyday people, do not want this. They see this for what it is.

I agree with you, but they are disenfranchised and don’t have much of a voice really. My website has been essentially wiped off of Google, almost. On Facebook they have shadow banned me which means people cannot see your posts. Most recently I found out when I was in Los Angeles on a Wi-Fi network from a large mall that they had banned my website on the claim that it was pornography. My point is that there are many people like us, but they do everything possible to make us disappear—to seem like we don’t exist. So it appears that there aren’t many people that think this way, because all you see are the people on tv that speak the narrative. We are made invisible.

Because the internet has a great reach which they want to control you mean?

Yes.

During your lecture in the German Bundestag you spoke of the attacks on Christian churches, crosses, symbols et cetera which we have already covered but Christians are getting arrested as well, specifically in the United Kingdom. For example, there was an African Christian street preacher in London, who was debating Muslims and then got arrested for alleged ‘islamophobia.’ This all reminds me of a book that dr. Jamie Glazov wrote, United in Hate, in which he writes about what he calls the unholy romance between the Left and Islam.

Yes, I agree that it is an unholy alliance, but it is not even about Islam, it is about shooting down Christianity. That is how I see it. It seems like the Left and Islam are allies, but they believe in diametrically opposed things, like homosexuality, sexual liberation. Islam is opposite to all of that. What unifies them is that they both have the same enemy: Judeo-Christian civilization, everything the Bible teaches. Just as much as some on the Left hate Islam, their hate for the true enemy, Western civilization, overrides their own obstacles towards each other. Because to them those are secondary, it doesn’t matter. I don’t think the Left really likes Islam. I just think they hate Christianity so much more, prompting them to ally with Islam. On the other hand, Muslims have nothing but contempt for the Left but they will work for them, vote Democratic, etc., here in the United States. There is an old saying “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” They are both staunch enemies, Islam as we know from history is the staunchest enemy of Christendom. The Left, the whole Marxist thing, is also very anti-Christian. Again, you think to yourself ‘I thought they don’t care for religion,’ right? Doesn’t Marxism hate every religion?’ It is interesting now that we see it ‘likes’ Islam, works with Islam, you cannot criticize Islam. All that is done in a way to attack Western civilization—that is the fundamental purpose.

Is this also the reason it doesn’t work to debate them in any logical way?

Yes, neither of them. The idea of wokism, everything they believe in, isn’t logical. Islamism is not logical, just look at the Hadith and some of the bizarre stuff Muhammad supposedly said, but you’re not supposed to talk about any of that . If you do, you will get cancelled or called an islamophobe or a racist, a homophobe, they have endless terms. But you can say anything about Christianity and attack it, the more you do that, the greater you are, the more enlightened and a great-thinker you are. I think it is very obvious, though people don’t see it in that sense. I think that if you are a secular thinker, you will not understand what is happening, because it seems very diverse and there are different groups, but if you look at it from a historical point of view, these two camps, it is very obvious and historically consistent. At least to me it is.

When you think of Islam, when you put it in a distinctly theological paradigm, you can say that Islam is a way of physically attacking Christianity, through force. This Leftist ideology, on the other hand, is more like subverting, you know—not openly attacking and killing but rather going into the body itself like a cancer and subverting it for ill. Even today most people complain about their own churches that seem like woke centres that don’t care anymore about Biblical teachings, it is just about, again, propagating the narrative that everyone else is talking about.

In Sweden, just a few months ago, when there were elections for the State Church there, people who were not even Christians, who were opposed to the Church’s teachings, were candidates in those elections, trying to change the church from within.

Yes, that is what they do. It is insane. This is what I think is happening, you have two sides of one coin: one is by force, violence, death, like the Roman pagan Empire back in the day; the other is more subtle, works underneath the radar, acts like your friend but is really betraying you. And that to me is what Western culture is gravitating towards.

Is the ignoring of Christian persecution part of that?

Yes, exactly, because ignoring Christian persecution is one thing that they have to do in order to convince everyone of a certain worldview. In this worldview Muslims are innocent and “misunderstood.” All seeming aspects of religious hostility are really about inequality, economics, and the like. So, to bring up something that I bring up all the time—Muslims systematically attacking and killing Christians just because they are Christians—throws a big wrench in their machine. Like I said, how do you deal with that? Well you just ignore it completely, until a huge attack happens then you take it on, but then you repackage it in a way so it still doesn’t look like Christian persecution, but as something else. When all is said and done and you have no excuses left, you just say: “Well, the people who did this are terrorists and they have nothing to do with Islam. They have hijacked Islam which is really a religion of peace,” and that is that.

And this is the order in which these things are dealt with?

Yes.

I myself noticed that at university where I study my professors also ignore this, they cannot think about this, the persecution of Christians, happening. Especially that this now is becoming a thing in Europe as well. They blame it on racism or just hatred of all religion and not Christianity in particular.

Because they have all these filters. “He is white, he is black,” so you know who is innocent and who is the bad guy, obviously, right? They have brainwashed people, really; it is mass-indoctrination. That is why Christian persecution under Islam doesn’t fit in. If we had the opposite, I have no doubt that if a Christian would persecute a Muslim for his religion that would be all over the news, non-stop—even if it were to happen in the least known third world country that nobody has heard of, because it would help their narrative, it would make it more believable: “See, here we go; just like we’ve said, whites are racists and Christians are also persecuting innocent Muslims.”

I have also noticed that here in the media what is happening in Myanmar was almost entirely framed around the ‘Rohingya Muslims’ being persecuted. Leaving out that the Karen, Kachin and Chin countries there are also persecuted, and leaving out that the Rohingya can also be Christians who are not only persecuted by the Tatmadaw but also by the Rohingya Muslims. Same thing with the Uyghur Muslims in China, the entire world knows about that from the press, but nothing is written about the Christian persecution in China. The same narrative, Muslims are the “victim” you have mentioned.

Yes, and anything that does not fit into or possibly undermines that narrative, they will just leave it out.

Turkey

To conclude this interview, what about Turkey’s role, because that also get very little attention. Concerning the attacks on the north of Iraq and Syria, recently there was a debate in Dutch parliament on the persecution of the Yezidis by ISIS but hardly anyone spoke about what also happened to Christians there. They talked about it as if this was something from the past while these attacks still occur and the Yezidis and the Christians are now in the middle of a violent conflict between the Kurds and Turkey. ISIS also is treated as if this is from the past, while they are still very much alive. Turkey’s president, Erdogan, is broadening his influence, their military basis in the region but also their ties with the Taliban in Afghanistan and in some parts of Africa. Someone called this Erdogan’s “Ottoman dreams.” Would you say the same?

Oh absolutely; the thing you have to remember about Turkey is that, unlike the other Islamic caliphates or sultanates of history, the Umayyads, the Abbasids, etc., the Ottomans are the most recent ones. A few much older people that lived under the Ottoman Empire are probably still alive because it was dissolved in the 1920’s; many still living had parents that lived under the Ottomans and so heard first-hand accounts. Turkey also provided weapons to Boko Haram in Nigeria.

They can still remember, you mean?

Yes, it is really still in their memory, especially for Turks—the greatness of the Ottoman Empire, which went on for almost half a millennium. In their mind that is still part of living history. Erdogan especially is always citing history; he is always extoling and praising the Ottoman sultans. I always find that interesting, because here in America now with all this “wokism,” the Founding Fathers are now all racists; after all, they were white and evil, right? But in fact, as compared to the rest of world history up till then, they were decent and ethical people who achieved many good things, but Americans are now taught to disavow them. In the Islamic world it is the opposite. Mehmed II, who was really a nasty person, and a notorious paedophile, burned churches, massacred Christians, enslaved women and children, and so on; yet he is presented as a great and wonderful ruler that Erdogan apparently wants to emulate. This just shows you how opposite things are between the West and the Islamic world especially. The West’s actual good past is demonized and the Islamic world’s bad past is praised and presented as something to re-emulate. Erdogan, especially, I have been following him, he is very much in love with history and the Ottoman glory. So, when you mention all the things that you just did, considering the Taliban and Iraq and all that, and his role in bringing all the migrants to Europe and funding jihadist mercenaries in Azerbaijan, it is very clear he sees himself as someone trying to put together something like the Ottoman Empire, which is, again, founded on Islamic principles and the sunna. A lot of Muslims in general like him.

And especially the ones living abroad, in the West?

Yes, because many of them agree with that vision.

Some of the Christians living in Turkey say that they are being used by the regime for propaganda of the regime’s well treatment of religious minorities?

I have seen that too, where they come out and say “yes, we are treated well,” but later on you find out that they were compelled by Turkish authorities to make such an announcement. He [Erdogan] is bad news, much of what he is doing or is behind. And it is not him, I think; it is just the spirit of the age, which means that if he would get out of the picture, there would be someone else who would be the same or even worse. That sort of thinking has no end; it is not limited to only one person seeking to bring back the “glories of Islam.” It is rather ongoing within the whole culture.

Is there something, in your opinion, that still could be done?

The easiest thing that could be done is what Eastern Europe is doing. You just stop migration; that is one very easy thing that is well justified and should not at all be deemed controversial. Any nation can or at least should have the right to say: “We are over-populated, this is the end of it; we don’t want any more.” But then you will still have the Muslim population that Europe already has; but at least it won’t get worse, you can start remedying things. Yet they don’t even want to do that much. If they can’t merely do that, then they can’t do much of anything. Basically, it is suicidal. This is why I always compare and contrast between history and today: the big difference is that back then Muslims were attacking Europe by swords and spears and Europeans were defending and trying to keep them out. Now they are not coming with swords and spears; they are being welcomed in and then, when they are in, some take the sword and do what they do. It is easy to just stop it, but they are not doing that and the people obviously do not have much voice or any say in the matter, so I think it will get much worse before it can get better.

What about de-radicalization, the governmental programs like that?

That is a joke. So many times it has been proven wrong, I remember this Usman Khan of London (London Bridge attack), they were touting him as a great graduate of their de-radicalization program. You know, saying how wonderful he was and that he was supposedly de-radicalized—but then, soon after “graduating” from their program and being released, he killed people, screaming “Allahu Akbar.” It is silly, that they put so much effort and money in that sort of programs. I am sure that some people do get de-radicalized, like they would have anyway, even without such a program. They can lose faith, that might happen just by itself, but I don’t think that these programs are the way to solve this.

https://www.kristv.com/news/local-news/crews-st-murder-suspect-was-convicted-in-1991-murder-case,Crews St. murder suspect was convicted in 1991 murder case,"A welfare check led police to discover the death of Melissa Hernandez on Dec. 3. Police have a suspect in custody, Hector Davila.

According to the arrest affidavit, Hernandez had been living with Davila for a month or two as his home healthcare provider.

According to testimony within the document, Hernandez’s family said Davila was obsessive over his health caretaker and acted like a jealous boyfriend.

Hernandez told her family she was ""scared"" of him.

The document states Hernandez was found stabbed dozens of times and had lacerations on her neck and face.

The way Hernandez was found bares a resemblance to another murder case. One Davila was convicted for 30 years ago.

Court documents we've obtained a state in 1991, Davila and his wife were having issues. This particular instance stemmed from Davila not having a job.

In a voluntary statement he made to police, Davila wrote that on the morning of Sept. 15, 1991, he walked into the bedroom and shot his wife three times.

He then placed a blanket over her and then left the house with his 3-year-old daughter. The next day he returned to the bedroom to wrap her in more blankets, he placed towels to trap the smell and he nailed the door shut. She was found by her family a few days later.

The gun Davila used was bought just a few days prior. After the shooting, he pawned the gun at a nearby shop.

Davila was sentenced to 60 years in prison for murder.

However, he was released on parole in Nov. of 2018, having served 27 years.

During his court process for the crime committed in 1991, documents show Davila was given a psychiatric evaluation.

In summary, the evaluator said they weren’t sure of his mental state, but ruled him competent. They wrote Davila showed signs of schizophrenia, but at times seemed competent.

He spoke of a shellfish conspiracy that made him paranoid that someone was going to kill him.

He said he heard a voice in his head, but could never elaborate on what the voice was telling him. The evaluator wrote they believed he said these things to build a case for insanity.

The judge in his 1991 case requested Davila get psychiatric help while in prison, but it’s unclear if that happened.

We reached out to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to ask why Davila was released early when he must serve half his sentence before becoming eligible.

They said the statute at the time of his crime said he only needed to serve one-quarter of his sentence.

He was eligible for parole in 2006. Davila was denied parole eight times before they approved him in 2018.

A stipulation was added that he complete a three-month treatment program to be released.

https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/world/nycs-rat-fighting-mayor-fined-over-infestation-at-own-house/,NYC's rat-fighting mayor fined over infestation at own house,"New York City Mayor Eric Adams is such an enemy of rats that he once called a press conference to demonstrate a contraption for drowning them in poison. Now Adams finds himself contesting a $300 fine issued by his own administration over a rat infestation at a building he owns in Brooklyn.

Adams was issued a summons by the city health department on May 10 after a health inspector spotted ""fresh rat droppings"" at his townhouse on Lafayette Avenue in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighbourhood.

The New York Times reports that Adams dialled into a city administrative court hearing on Tuesday to contest the $300 fine, which he was issued after first ignoring the summons.

Adams told the hearing officer that he had spent nearly $7,000 battling rats at the property and had even used the rat-drowning device that he promoted in 2019 when he was Brooklyn borough president, the Times said.

Adams noted that city laws are designed to penalize homeowners for failing to take steps to prevent and control rodents, according to the Times. ""I took those steps,"" he said, ""and will continue to do so.""

The hearing officer with the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, known as OATH, said he would render a verdict within 30 days.

After Adams failed to respond to the initial rat summons, he was found in violation by default.

The Times reported that Adams had Rahul Agarwal, a deputy chief counsel in the mayor's office, file a motion to vacate on the mayor's behalf on Sept. 8. In the motion, Agarwal said Adams had not learned of the summons until Sept. 1 because he now lives in Gracie Mansion, the mayor's residence in Manhattan.

This week's administrative hearing was scheduled after Agarwal requested an adjournment of an earlier meeting date on behalf of Adams, according to the Times.

The leader of a government watchdog group criticized the involvement of a city lawyer in the matter.

""City resources should be used for city business, not the personal affairs of the mayor or any other elected official,"" said Betsy Gotbaum, executive director of the Citizens Union. ""The mayor should not be tasking any City Hall employee with helping him resolve what is clearly a private legal manner.""

A spokesperson for Adams said the mayor had done nothing improper. ""He spent thousands of dollars to remediate an infestation at his residence in Brooklyn earlier this year, and was happy to appear before OATH today to state as much,"" the mayor's press secretary, Fabien Levy, said in a statement Tuesday.

The administrative hearing took place a week after Adams, a Democrat who has been mayor since the start of this year, posted a job listing for a director of rodent mitigation — AKA rat czar. The ideal candidate is ""highly motivated and somewhat bloodthirsty, determined to look at all solutions from various angles, including improving operational efficiency, data collection, technology innovation, trash management, and wholesale slaughter,"" according to the ad.

Levy said Adams ""has made no secret of the fact that he hates rats — whether scurrying around on the streets or terrorizing building tenants.""

These days, there isn't much secrecy about the Grand Lodge of Texas or, for that matter, any of the Masonic or near-Masonic museums and libraries in this city, which hosts a historically high convergence of these once-powerful fraternal groups.

Freemasons trace their history back to 13th-century European stonemason guilds. But in the U.S., their private lodges — replete with arcane signs and symbols — were, for the most part, fraternal societies that outsiders found hard to crack. Thus, the air of secrecy.

Years ago, on another road trip to Waco, I was struck by the singularity of the Grand Lodge of Texas, located on Columbus Avenue, not far from the McLennan County Courthouse. The 1948 state headquarters, which occupies almost a full block, rises like a stone palace from a movie fantasy among the mostly mundane brick downtown structures.

Few windows face the avenue, which contributes to its feel of airtight mystery.

Little did I know that Masons are proud to show off their history and explain their movement in Texas and the world. You can visit and do research at four major fraternal museums and libraries in Waco. I explored two of them — besides the Grand Lodge of Texas, I also toured the York Rite Library and Museum, currently under renovation — on a recent weekend.

How did the Masons end up in Texas?

The imagery, ornaments, uniforms, rituals and rules of Freemasonry remain strange to somebody like me. I grew up at a time when these societies were considered cryptic, maybe even a little alarming.

One doesn't learn much about the Masons in school, but the fraternal groups arrived in North America from Europe during the mid-18th century. Their American leaders have included such luminaries as George Washington, Ben Franklin, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, J. Edgar Hoover, Harry Truman, Henry Ford, Medgar Evers and Alex Haley.

Closer to home, Sam Houston, Stephen F. Austin, Davy Crockett and Anson Jones were Masons, as were many later Texas governors, legislators, judges and municipal leaders.

Colonizer Austin tried to establish the first Texas lodge as early as 1828, appealing to the Grand York Lodge of Mexico for permission. He was stymied, however, by a quarrel between the ""Yorkinos"" (York Rite) and the ""Escoceses"" (Scottish Rite). The Scottish Rite remains the largest subset of Masons worldwide.

Texans under Dr. Anson Jones, future president of the republic, successfully petitioned John Henry Holland, head of the Grand Lodge of Louisiana, to organize in Brazoria in 1835. After its members were scattered during the Texas Revolution, the Holland Lodge reorganized in Houston in October 1837.

""Although constituting only 1 and a half percent of the population, Masons filled some 80 percent of the Republic of Texas' higher offices,"" reports the reliable Handbook of Texas Online. ""All of the presidents, vice presidents and secretaries of state were Masons.

""After annexation, Masons continued to be equally prominent in the state government, and between 1846 and 1861, five of the six governors were members of the fraternity. Masonry continued to prosper; by 1860 Texas had 226 active lodges and 9,000 members.""

Did those prominent leaders make decisions behind closed doors that affected the fate of our state or our country? Some people outside their membership certainly thought so. Others probably still think so.

Today, according to the Grand Lodge of Texas website, there are over 90,000 Masons in the state and more than 900 lodges. In the public mind, Masonry is more closely associated with schools, hospitals, the arts and other charitable causes today than with ancient symbols and secret signs á la Hollywood thrillers.

""We still do have a few secret handshakes,"" jokes Melissa Spann, whose mother, Maggie Matyastik, preceded her as leader of the Social Order of the Beauceant, the women's Masonic group that meets at the York Rite Library and Museum in Waco. ""But that's about it.""

Two Masonic hotspots in Waco

An early stop during a recent road trip to Waco was that handsome York Rite Library and Museum. Built in 1913 and 1914, it resembles other Masonic lodges located in medium and large Texas cities — solid, dignified, but also a little enigmatic. It's clearly not a church, although its Greek Revival features suggest so. Despite some ground-level retail, it's not strictly a commercial or an office building.

Before the trip, I had stumbled across its alluring name on Google Maps. The group that runs the museum posts on Facebook, so I contacted Jon Spann, who heads the Baylor Lodge #1235. He offered to give me and my road-trip buddy a private tour, since the library and museum are currently not ready for the general public.

We met Jon and his wife, Melissa, on the Washington Avenue side of the building. Formerly, a preliminary museum had occupied a space on the ground floor. Now the main hall at this level serves as the meeting place for the Social Order of the Beauceant. The second floor, surrounded by photos of past leaders and ceremonial gear, houses the Baylor Lodge, the men's group.

The top floor, future home of the museum, is now a sort of Victorian attic full of fascinating artifacts waiting to be properly displayed and interpreted. The Spanns estimate that the renewed museum could be open within a year or two.

Ultimately, despite some trepidation on my part, the four of us took the building's original elevator, more than 100 years old, back down to the first floor. You've got to live a little every once in a while.

After wishing the Spanns well, we headed one block away to the Grand Lodge of Texas. Before reaching that destination, we passed the intriguing Texas Baptist Historical Collection building. (Bookmark those archives for future research. What a city of libraries!)

On the south side of the grandiose Masonic structure on Columbus, we rang the bell at the glass entryway and told the person on the other end of the line that we wanted a tour. She buzzed us in and directed us to the library.

But first we took in the lobby of the assembly hall, which we later learned holds 3,700 people. That would make it much larger than Bass Concert Hall or the Long Center for the Performing Arts in Austin.

If the exterior of the Grand Lodge looks like ""The Wizard of Oz"" as imagined by architect Albert Speer, this theater is a dead ringer for the United Nations Assembly Hall in New York.

The library, which holds the correspondence and records from hundreds of Texas Masonic lodges, is large and well lighted. There, we met our guide, Jim Harold, a Masonic leader who not only knew everything worth knowing about Freemasonry but was also a crackerjack expert on Texas history. In fact, he had previously served a site director at two state historical sites, including Washington-on-the-Brazos.

He led us around the lobby, which displays portraits of previous Texas Masonic leaders, going back to the Holland Lodge. Harold explained that Houston hosted the Grand Lodge of Texas, essentially the state headquarters, from 1837 until this structure was built in 1948, closer to the geographic center of the state.

Harold then took us through several alcoves and galleries, which I imagined to be the extent of the museum.

Nope.

A whole floor below the main entry level is dedicated to slick displays, historic photos, interpretive material and — my favorite — an L-shaped hallway lined with what looked like thousands of pictures of Texas lodges, from modest ones in the smallest Texas towns to imposing structures in the state's largest cities. This priceless visual evidence should be known by every history buff in the state.

By the time we left the Grand Lodge, we were sated. We headed across Columbus Avenue for refreshments at Southern Roots Brewing Company, one of dozens of new attractions in a downtown Waco highlighted by Magnolia Market, TV's Chip and Joanna Gaines' transformative project.

Plan a pilgrimage to the fraternal shrines of Waco

But wait: two fraternal temples were not enough for this city. A little more digital digging turned up two more — the Lee Lockwood Library and Museum for the Scottish Rite Masons, and the Improved Order of Red Men Museum and Library (not technically Masons, but similar). We didn't have time to visit them, but they are now on my radar.

Here are some tidbits about all four shrines:

Grand Lodge of Texas: The headquarters for almost all Masonic lodges in Texas. Built in 1948, its modernist building is a site any Texan should see. For best results, call ahead for a tour. (715 Columbus Ave.; 254-753-7395; grandlodgeoftexas.org)

https://www.dailydot.com/debug/midterms-2022-house-republicans-big-tech-agenda/,Midterms 2022: What Is the Republican Big Tech Agenda?,"Republicans have painted themselves as unfairly victimized by big tech censorship over the past four years, as several prominent conservatives have been banned from social media platforms.

Featured Video

While their gripes are grounded in some legitimacy, they also believe they’re on the wrong end of a concerted effort by companies to silence their voices by algorithmically demoting content. They believe their opinion on the COVID-19 pandemic were filtered out in favor of Democrats. They believe, without a doubt, that big tech and the mainstream media conspired to shift the 2020 election by censoring and restricting stories about President Joe Biden’s son.

And left unchecked, they’ll do it all again in 2024.

With the GOP likely to take control of the House and possibly win the Senate, the party plans a full-out assault in response.

Advertisement

While the party, even with control of both chambers, won’t get any bills past President Joe Biden, there are several avenues it can attempt to hit back at big tech. From hearings to investigations, a Republican House will likely be laser-focused on retribution against everyone from Meta to Google to TikTok.

They’re mad they’ve been branded as misinformation artists. That their memes aren’t getting retweets, that their emails are winding up in spam, and that the companies doing it are staffed by liberal elites who they feel look down on their party.

At the forefront of their agenda is Section 230. Section 230 is a part of a 1996 law intended to shield internet publishers from liability for what users post on their platforms. It is seen as the bedrock for the modern internet, but Republicans feel social media companies are violating the statute in myriad ways, predominantly when they moderate and algorithmically distribute content, acting as publishers instead of platforms.

For supposedly limiting the reach of offensive or conspiratorial Donald Trump Jr. posts to keeping their follower counts artificially low, Republicans now want to strip away the protections social media companies have from the lawsuits Section 230 shields them from.

Advertisement

They have allies in Democrats, who wish to change the way the statute works as well, for different reasons. While a partnership may not be forged, Republicans already have bills to hold hearings and grandstand upon.

Republicans laid out their roadmap for a Section 230 overhaul in advance of taking the House. It will take a wrecking ball to the ideas of a free and open internet, privacy, and content moderation.

Seemingly every controversial Republican has a particular part of the statute they want to destroy, with bills or measures sponsored by a who’s who of GOP figures. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) wants to strip protections from companies who “censor constitutionally protected” speech. Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) wants to “prevent companies from blocking or preventing access to lawful content.” Rep. Greg Pence (R-Ind.), the brother of former Vice President Mike Pence, wants to strip the statute from companies that have counterfeit goods listed on their platform for sale. In total, Republican Energy and Commerce Committee members proposed 11 different “carve-outs” that would gut Section 230, all vaguely worded enough to be used as threats but perhaps not coherent enough to be put into fungible legislation.

Others want the statute entirely abolished.

The Online Content and Policy Modernization Act was proposed during a time when Republicans were crying foul over COVID-19 misinformation policies and 2020 election censorship. It would remove all Section 230 protections from platforms that actively restricted information or modified posts made by users, like when Twitter would put a fact-check on then-President Donald Trump.

The act would remove protections for “any decision or agreement made or action taken by a provider or user of an interactive computer service to restrict access to or availability of material provided by another information content provider.”

The Electronic Frontier Foundation called the bill an “unconstitutional mess” when it was proposed, and a coalition of tech advocacy groups signed a letter urging the Senate Judiciary Committee to reject the bill.

While the bill—proposed by Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)—never made it out of committee, it could set the stage for what Republicans do in the new year. In the House, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) introduced a similar bill barring companies that ban users or restrict access to their websites from receiving Section 230 protection. Under Greene’s bill, users that believe they were wrongly suspended or banned could be granted the power to sue tech companies that banned them.

While it’s aimed at retribution against big tech, it could have the adverse effect of entrenching the biggest companies, as they’d be the only sites that could afford the myriad lawsuits any platform might be beset with.

But before they set about accidentally banning free speech online, their crusade will likely involve hauling tech executives in front of Congress to answer for their supposed crimes.

The party in charge has subpoena power, and in the past two years, Democrats used it to develop an antitrust case against Alphabet, Amazon, and others. But Republicans’ concerns in these hearings have always been less refined, using them to question if Google would adopt a “bigoted anti-police policy” or ask how ads work.

With a majority in the House, however, Republicans could set the antitrust agenda, grilling CEOs on why their QAnon praise got deleted. Republican antitrust hearings would have twice the spectacle and none of the substance.

Advertisement

At the heart of all of this is a vindictive party that wants to punish tech companies for what it views as years and years of censorship by Silicon Valley. A Republican-controlled House can enact their very public revenge.

They also want to take up the mantle of anti-censorship, but only for the leaders of their parties. It’s a matter Republican state legislatures have already been pushing, with Texas and Florida leading the way.

The two states have new laws aiming to stop social media companies from deplatforming or taking down posts from candidates running for office or official representatives. The laws set up fines for the companies that do so, which can run up to $250,000 per day in Florida. The Florida law was proposed after then-President Donald Trump was banned from Twitter and could soon go before the Supreme Court. A Republican-leaning court clear a path for a national bill that could allow Congress to dictate how social media companies police their users.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said the law would offer Floridians “protection against the Silicon Valley elites” and said that if companies’ “censors enforce rules inconsistently, to discriminate in favor of the dominant Silicon Valley ideology, they will now be held accountable.”

Advertisement

According to the New York Times, over 100 similar bills have been proposed across the country.

At the heart of the “dominant Silicon Valley ideology” is what they believe to be liberal views, best exemplified by Twitter and Facebook’s suppressing a New York Post story about Hunter Biden’s laptop a month before the 2020 election. Under the Florida law, social media platforms cannot take down or deprioritize content from a “journalistic enterprise” of a certain size.

The story was briefly censored on social media platforms and dismissed by major news outlets, who called it a hoax.

But, as more details came to light, the salacious content of Hunter Biden’s laptop was proven to be true, vindicating Republicans. Now, almost every executive at Twitter and Facebook who had a role in blocking links to the story will be called before Congress to explain how they swung the 2020 election for Biden.

Advertisement

A Republican-controlled House could also do what Federal Communications Commissioner Brendan Carr has been pushing for and investigate TikTok, a matter they’ve already shown interest in.

TikTok, despite its popularity, has largely escaped the ire of Congress thus far. But with growing pressure from conservatives to ban or crack down on the app, it too could be in the crosshairs in a GOP-controlled House, which would be firmly anti-China.

In July, after a bombshell BuzzFeed article, House Republicans demanded TikTok prove that U.S. user data was not being held in China, where the app’s parent company is based. The move followed increased scrutiny of the popular social media app from U.S. officials over the summer.

Perhaps the only tech platform that will escape their investigative desires is the current iteration of Twitter. When Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter was finalized last month, Republicans implied that they were ready for an uncensored platform, alleging that free speech had been shackled in the past. Musk was praised for liberating their ideology on the platform, and they’re optimistic he’ll bring back formerly banned right-wing accounts.

Advertisement

Or maybe not. He’s already upset some of them meeting with civil rights leaders about content moderation and has yet to reinstate accounts.

Christopher Mitchell, a director for the advocacy group the Institute for Local Self-Reliance said he thinks Republican hearings will be spectacles.

“This is a party that has become more interested in just being in the news than actually accomplishing anything legislatively,” he said in an interview with the Daily Dot. “And so I’m more worried about them trying to obstruct things using hearings.”

Meaning big tech is about to be hit with some big fireworks.

Wade some 14 states have banned abortions and are either protecting unborn babies from the moment of conception or have heartbeat laws protecting babies when their heartbeat can be detected at 6 weeks. Some states have done both.

But the battle to save babies from abortions is not over. Another 8 states are currently fighting in court to get their abortion ban or heartbeat law upheld. And a few more states could see abortion bans proposed in their state legislatures during the next legislative session, especially if elections in those states yield a pro-life governor or a pro-life legislature.

14 States Have Abortion Bans Enforced

Alabama: Alabama did not have a trigger law that immediately made abortions illegal. Instead, state officials had to secure enforcement of a 2019 pro-life law that protects babies from abortions. Following the decision, all three of Alabama’s abortion businesses stopped killing babies in abortions and a federal judge granted the state’s request to lift an injunction and allow the state to enforce the 2019 abortion ban signed into law by pro-life Governor Kay Ivey.

Arkansas: Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge has certified that the trigger law for the Natural State is now in effect in accordance with Act 180 of 2019.

Georgia: The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the state’s heartbeat law can go into effect, saving babies with beating hearts from abortions.

Idaho: The Idaho Supreme Court allowed the state’s heartbeat law to be enforced that protects the lives of unborn babies when they have a detectable heartbeat at 6 weeks. The state’s highest court also rejected Planned Parenthood’s bid to block the state’s trigger law from going into effect on August 25th, which would protect babies starting at conception.

Kentucky: Babies will once continue to be protected from abortions in Kentucky following a state Supreme Court ruling reinstating the ban as the lawsuit from two abortion businesses against it proceeds.

Louisiana: The Louisiana Supreme Court issued a ruling allowing the state’s abortion ban to continue saving babies from abortions while the lawsuit against it from abortion businesses continues.

Mississippi: Mississippi was one of 10 states to ban abortions following the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Thanks to a state judge who denied a request from Mississippi’s last remaining abortion business to stay open, the new ban protecting babies is in effect.

Missouri: Minutes after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, Missouri became the first state to invoke a trigger law banning all abortions in the state, except in cases of medical emergency. Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt issued an opinion that would trigger parts of a state House bill that outlaws almost all abortions in the state.

Oklahoma: Before Roe was overturned, Oklahoma had the distinction of becoming the first in the nation to successfully ban abortions from conception when Governor Kevin Stitt signed its Texas-style abortion ban. But, with the Supreme Court reversing Roe, the state’s trigger ban has gone into effect — which successfully bans abortions without having to rely on a private enforcement mechanism.

South Dakota: The state become the 2nd after Roe fell to invoke its trigger ban protecting babies.

Tennessee: The Tennessee trigger law went into effect on August 25th to protect babies from abortions.

Texas: As the first state in the nation to successfully ban abortions thanks to its private right of action law, Texas has seen its abortions drop over 50% as a result. Then, a pre-Roe abortion law went into effect immediately following the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade that provided protection for babies starting at conception.Now, its trigger law has gone into effect for the strongest pro-life law possible.

West Virginia: West Virginia Gov Jim Justice has signed the abortion ban and it protects babies from conception.

Wisconsin: The state’s pre-Roe abortion ban is now in effect and all abortion businesses have reportedly stopped killing babies. But abortion activists are fighting to overturn the law in court.

8 States are Fighting in Court to Save Their Abortion Ban

The state of Arizona, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, South Carolina, North Dakota, Utah and Wyoming are all fighting in court to protect their abortion bans so babies can be saved.

Iowa appears likely to keep its abortion ban in place thanks to a change in the makeup of the state Supreme Court and reversing a decision falsely claiming the state constitution allows a right to abortion. South Carolina’s heartbeat bill will likely be upheld bu its conservative Supreme Court — and the same is expected in the rest of the states..

Ultimately, if all of these abortion bans are upheld, 22 states will protect babies from abortions.

Other States With the Potential to Protect Babies From Abortions

Other states have the potential to pass abortion bans protecting babies.

Florida is one of the most likely and the state is currently fighting to get state courts to uphold its 15-week abortion ban. A state appeals court ruled it can be enforce while the lawsuit continues and, should the lawsuit be successful and the misuse of the privacy clause in the state constitution to confer a right to abortion overcome, then an abortion ban is the next step. Governor Ron DeSantis would sign it into law immediately as he signed the 15-week ban.

Nebraska is the second most likely state to ban abortions. Governor Pete Ricketts wants an abortion ban but the unicameral legislature is one vote short of having the two-thirds necessary to overcome a Democrat filibuster. Pro-life voters need to work hard to elect more pro-life members so the state can protect babies.

North Carolina and Virginia are two states that also have a potential to ban abortions. Virginia has a pro-life governor but needs more pro-life legislators to get a bill to Governor Youngkin’s desk as the legislature will be split in 2023. North Carolina has a pro-abortion governor but a pro-life supermajority that can pass an abortion ban over his veto.

Alaska and Montana are also possibilities to ban abortions but both are dealing with state Supreme Court decisions that have misused the privacy clause of their state constitution to declare abortions are legal. If they can change the courts and overcome those decisions, they have a chance to protect babies.

The only other possible state to protect babies is Kansas — though the recent vote on its pro-life amendment may crush its hopes of protecting babies for a few years. It will need to elect a pro-life governor, change its Supreme Court, pass an abortion ban, and get a new decision overturning the ruling misusing the privacy clause to confer an abortion right. That’s a long-term project, and like Alaska and Montana, its akin to having to wait to overturn Roe.

29 State Maximum

If every one of the states in each of these three categories can ban abortions, then 29 total states — almost three-fifths of America — would protect babies from abortions. It’s virtually impossible to see any of the other 21 states banning abortions any time in the near future because they are run by pro-abortion Democrats.",Q4

GOP senators who supported a major gun control bill have ruled out supporting an “assault weapons” ban, their offices told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Democrats have resumed efforts to pass such a ban after a shooting at Club Q in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on Nov. 20, which killed five people.

President Joe Biden has pushed for Congress to pass the ban through the lame-duck session of the 117th Congress.

Republican senators who, in the past, have worked with Democrats on gun control told the Daily Caller News Foundation they will not support new attempts to pass a more far-reaching firearm ban in the lame-duck session of the 117th Congress, following a mass shooting in Colorado Springs on Nov. 20.

In June, 15 GOP senators voted with Democrats to pass the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, following the killing of 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, which added “domestic violence abusers” to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and enhanced the review process for gun purchasers under 21 years of age. However, none of these lawmakers who responded to the Daily Caller News Foundation indicated they would support a bill that encompasses the AR-15, a popular rifle among American gunowners.

“Senator [Pat] Toomey [of Pennsylvania]…does not support a ban on assault weapons because it would prohibit law-abiding citizens from owning what are some of the most popular firearms in the United States,” a spokesperson for Toomey told the DCNF.

The office of Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, meanwhile, shared an article with the DCNF about Graham owning an AR-15, indicating his opposition to the ban. A spokesman for Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who also voted for June’s legislation, said that he had been “consistently opposed” to an assault weapons ban and would not be supporting new legislation. This was echoed by an aide to Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who said that Sasse would not support the ban even though he is leaving the Senate at the end of the year.

Such a ban is a “complete non-starter” said Daniel Keylin, a spokesman for Republican Sen. Thom Tills of North Carolina. Additionally, Republican Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio, Todd Young of Indiana and Joni Ernst of Iowa told the DCNF they’d vote against any proposed ban.

After failing to pass a ban through the Senate in July, Congressional Democrats and President Joe Biden have made it a top agenda item in the last two months of the outgoing Congress. Democrats will need ten GOP votes to overcome a filibuster, after which they may pass the bill with a simple majority of 50 votes and Vice President Kamala Harris’s tiebreaker.

“Does it have 60 votes in the Senate right now? Probably not. But let’s see if we can try to get that number as close to 60 as possible,” said Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who is leading the effort to gather support for a bill, on CNN on Sunday. Retiring and moderate GOP Senators have been coveted for their support for other Democratic-led initiatives, such as a bill to give immigration relief to participants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.

Five Republicans apart from Toomey – Portman, Richard Shelby of Alabama, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Richard Burr of North Carolina and Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma – did not seek reelection to the chamber. Apart from them, Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who was recently reelected, are considered “moderate” Republicans.

Following the Club Q shooting, talks among Senate Democrats for a ban on certain firearms ramped up, with Biden publicly calling for legislative action on semiautomatic weapons.

“The idea we still allow semiautomatic weapons to be purchased is sick. Just sick…It has no, no social redeeming value. Zero. None. Not a single solitary rationale for it except profit for the gun manufacturers” Biden said to reporters on Nantucket Island in Massachusetts, where he was spending Thanksgiving with his family at the home of billionaire donor David Rubenstein.

He added that he would begin “counting the votes” to pass such a bill. By contrast, some GOP lawmakers in the House, where Democrats will lose their majority in the next Congress, have said they will support some firearms.

“There are ways you can write it where it preserves due process, protects law-abiding gun owners’ rights, but at the same time advances community safety,” said Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania’s 1st District on Fox News Sunday. Fitzpatrick was one of two GOP congressmen to vote for H.R. 1808, a bill that sought to ban assault weapons that passed the House in July.

Blunt, Burr, Collings, Inhofe, Murkowski, Romney and Shelby’s offices did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It might be easy to dismiss the run-around Nick Turse has gotten in trying to obtain basic information about the US military presence in Africa, namely the number of bases, as a dog bites man story. But that reaction indicated the degree to which we’ve become inured to official misconduct, and yes, patently incomplete responses to FOIAs is misconduct. But it now seem the attitude of big entities, be they private or government, is “So sue me.”

Another aspect, which Turse does not dwell on, is the fact that the US clearly has beefed up in Africa while pretending not to, stands in noteworthy contrast to how the Chinese have gained influence there. The Chinese have engaged in direct investing and have made loans in a series of areas. From Foreign Policy Research Institute report found (pub date 2022 but based on data only through 2018):

We analyze the effects of FDI investments and loans from China on the change in political alignment. We find that FDI investment from China is positively related to an African country’s change in political alignment with China. Specifically, between 2001 and 2012, every $1 billion investment resulted in approximately an 8% increase in the average political alignment with China….Our data reveals that economic engagement achieves greater alignment post-2008. Lastly, loans from China are also positively related to an African country’s change in political alignment with China…Our data reveals that, post-2008, economic investment via loans achieved slightly less political alignment. The finding that FDI and loans from China to Sub-Saharan Africa increased their political alignment with China does not necessarily mean they are less aligned with the U.S. This finding could simply reflect greater global alignment on non-controversial issues. As such, we also examined how Chinese FDI investments impacted alignment between African countries and the U.S. We find that FDI investment from China reduces African countries’ political alignment with the U.S. Specifically, between 2008 and 2012, every $1 billion investment resulted in an approximate 1.3% decrease in average political alignment with the U.S.

But the US prefers sticks, or in this case guns, to carrots.

By Nick Turse. Originally published at TomDispatch

What’s the U.S. military doing in Africa? It’s an enigma, wrapped in a riddle, straight-jacketed in secrecy, and hogtied by red tape. Or at least it would be if it were up to the Pentagon.

Ten years ago, I embarked on a quest to answer that question at TomDispatch, chronicling a growing American military presence on that continent, a build-up of both logistical capabilities and outposts, and the possibility that far more was occurring out of sight. “Keep your eye on Africa,” I concluded. “The U.S. military is going to make news there for years to come.”

I knew I had a story when U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) failed to answer basic questions honestly. And the command’s reaction to the article told me that I also had a new beat.

Not long after publication, AFRICOM wrote a letter of complaint to my editor, Tom Engelhardt, attempting to discredit my investigation. (I responded point by point in a follow-up piece.) The command claimed the U.S. was doing little on that continent, had one measly base there, and was transparent about its operations. “I would encourage you and those who have interest in what we do to review our Website, www.AFRICOM.mil, and a new Defense Department Special Web Report on U.S. Africa Command at this link http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2012/0712_AFRICOM/,” wrote its director of public affairs Colonel Tom Davis.

A decade later, the link is dead; Davis is a functionary at Pima Community College in Tucson, Arizona; and I’m still keeping an eye on AFRICOM.

A few months ago, in fact, I revealed the existence of a previously unknown AFRICOM investigation of an airstrike in Nigeria that killed more than 160 civilians. A formerly secret 2017 Africa Command document I obtained called for an inquiry into that “U.S.-Nigerian” operation that was never disclosed to Congress, much less the public.

Since then, AFRICOM has steadfastly refused to offer a substantive comment on the strike or the investigation that followed and won’t even say if it will release relevant documents to members of Congress. Last month, citing my reporting, a group of lawmakers from the newly formed Protection of Civilians in Conflict Caucus called on Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to turn over the files on, and answer key questions about, the attack. The Pentagon has so far kept mum.

Has AFRICOM then, as Davis contended so long ago, been transparent? Is its website the go-to spot for information about U.S. military missions on that continent? Did its operations there remain few and innocuous? Or was I onto something?

A Kinder, Gentler Combatant Command

From its inception, according to its first commander, General William Ward, AFRICOM was intended “to be a different kind of command”: less hardcore, more Peace Corps. “AFRICOM’s focus is on war prevention,” Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for African Affairs Theresa Whelan said in 2007, “rather than warfighting.”

In 2012, Ward’s successor, General Carter Ham, told the House Armed Services Committee that “small teams” of American personnel were conducting “a wide range of engagements in support of U.S. security interests.” Years later, retired Army Brigadier General Don Bolduc, who served at AFRICOM from 2013 to 2015 and headed Special Operations Command Africa until 2017, would offer some clarity about those “engagements.” Between 2013 and 2017, he explained, American commandos saw combat in at least 13 African countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Somalia, South Sudan, and Tunisia. U.S. troops, he added, were killed or wounded in action in at least six of them.

Between 2015 and 2017, there were at least 10 unreported attacks on American troops in West Africa alone. A month after that January 2017 Nigerian air strike, in fact, U.S. Marines fought al-Qaeda militants in a battle that AFRICOM still won’t admit took place in Tunisia. That April, a U.S. commando reportedly killed a member of warlord Joseph Kony’s Lord’s Resistance Army in the Central African Republic. The next month, during an advise, assist, and accompany mission, 38-year-old Navy SEAL Kyle Milliken was killed and two other Americans were wounded in a raid on a militant camp in Somalia. That same year, a Navy SEAL reportedly shot and killed a man outside a compound flying an Islamic State (ISIS) flag in Cameroon. And that October, AFRICOM was finally forced to abandon the fiction that U.S. troops weren’t at war on the continent after ISIS militants ambushed American troops in Niger, killing four and wounding two more. “We don’t know exactly where we’re at in the world, militarily, and what we’re doing,” said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, then a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, after meeting with Pentagon officials about the attack.

In the 2010s, I would, in fact, help reveal that the U.S. had conducted at least 36 named operations and activities in Africa — more than anywhere else on earth, including the Middle East. Among them were eight 127e programs, named for the budgetary authority that allows Special Operations forces to use foreign military units as surrogates in counterterrorism missions. More recently, I would report on 11 of those proxy programs employed in Africa, including one in Tunisia, code-named Obsidian Tower and never acknowledged by the Pentagon, and another with a notoriously abusive Cameroonian military unit connected to mass atrocities.

Five of those 127e programs were conducted in Somalia by U.S. commandos training, equipping, and directing troops from Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and Uganda as part of the fight against the Islamist militant group al-Shabaab. In 2018, 26-year-old Alex Conrad of the Army’s Special Forces was killed in an attack on a small U.S. military outpost in Somalia.

Such outposts have long been a point of contention between AFRICOM and me. “The U.S. maintains a surprising number of bases in Africa,” I wrote in that initial TomDispatch article in July 2012. Colonel Davis denied it. “Other than our base at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti,” he claimed, “we do not have military bases in Africa.” I had, he insisted, filed that article before AFRICOM could get me further outpost material. “If he had waited, we would have provided the information requested, which could have better informed his story.”

I had begun requesting information that May, called in additional questions in June and July, and then (as requested) put them in writing. I followed up on the 9th, mentioning my looming deadline and was told that AFRICOM headquarters might have some answers for me on the 10th. That day came and went, as did the 11th. TomDispatch finally published the piece on July 12th. “I respectfully submit that a vigorous free press cannot be held hostage, waiting for information that might never arrive,” I wrote Davis.

When I later followed up, Davis turned out to be on leave, but AFRICOM spokesperson Eric Elliott emailed in August to say: “Let me see what I can give you in response to your request for a complete list of facilities.”

Then, for weeks, AFRICOM went dark. A follow-up email in late October went unanswered. Another in early November elicited a response from spokesperson Dave Hecht, who said that he was handling the request and would provide an update by week’s end. I’m sure you won’t be shocked to learn that he didn’t. So, I followed up yet again. On November 16th, he finally responded: “All questions now have answers. I just need the boss to review before I can release. I hope to have them to you by mid next week.” Did I get them? What do you think?

In December, Hecht finally replied: “All questions have been answered but are still being reviewed for release. Hopefully this week I can send everything your way.” Did he? Hah!

In January 2013, I received answers to some questions of mine, but nothing about those bases. By then, Hecht, too, had disappeared and I was left dealing with AFRICOM’s Chief of Media Engagement, Benjamin Benson. When asked about my questions, he replied that public affairs couldn’t provide answers and I should instead file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.

To recap, six months later, Benson recommended I start again. And in good faith, I did. In 2016, three and a half years later, I finally received a partial response to that FOIA request: one page of partially redacted — not to mention useless — information about (yep!) Camp Lemonnier and nothing else.

I would spend years investigating the bases Davis claimed didn’t exist. Using leaked secret documents, I shed light on a network of African drone bases integral to U.S. assassination programs on the continent as well as the existence of a secret network of National Security Agency eavesdropping outposts in Ethiopia. Using formerly secret documents, I revealed an even larger network of U.S. bases across Africa, again and again. I used little-noticed open-source information to highlight activities at those facilities, while helping expose murder and torture by local forces at a drone base in Cameroon built-up and frequented by Americans. I also spotlighted the construction of a $100 million drone base in Niger; a previously unreported outpost in Mali apparently overrun by militants after a 2012 coup there by a U.S.-trained officer; the expansion of a shadowy drone base in the Horn of Africa and its role in lethal strikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria; hundreds of drone strikes from Libya to Somalia and the resulting civilian casualties; and the flailing, failing U.S. war on terror all across Africa.

Not surprisingly, AFRICOM’s website never had much to say about such reporting, nor could you go there to find articles like:

“The AFRICOM Files: Pentagon Undercounts and Ignores Military Sexual Assault in Africa”

“Pentagon Document Shows U.S. Knew of ‘Credible’ Reports of Civilian Casualties After Its Attacks in Somalia”

“New Data Shows the U.S. Military Is Severely Undercounting Civilian Casualties in Somalia”

“Pentagon Stands by Cameroon — Despite Forensic Analysis Showing Its Soldiers Executed Women and Children”

“U.S. Troops in Africa Might be in Danger. Why Is the Military Trying to Hide It?”

You Know You’re on Target When You’re Getting a Lot of Flak(s)

In the years since, a parade of AFRICOM press officials came and went, replying in a by-then-familiar fashion. “Nick, we’re not going to respond to any of your questions,” Lieutenant Commander Anthony Falvo, head of its public affairs branch, told me in October 2017. Did he, I asked, believe AFRICOM needn’t address questions from the press in general or only from me. “No, just you,” he replied. “We don’t consider you a legitimate journalist, really.” Then he hung up.

That same month, I was inadvertently ushered behind the closed doors of the AFRICOM public affairs office. While attempting to hang up on me, a member of the staff accidentally put me on speakerphone and suddenly I found myself listening in to the goings on, from banal banter to shrieking outbursts. And, believe me, it wasn’t pretty. While the command regularly claimed its personnel had the utmost respect for their local counterparts, I discovered, for example, that at least certain press officers appeared to have a remarkably low opinion of some of their African partners. At one point, Falvo asked if there was any “new intelligence” regarding military operations in Niger after the 2017 ambush that killed those four American soldiers. “You can’t put Nigeriens and intelligence in the same sentence,” replied someone in the office. Laughter followed and I published the sordid details. That very month, Anthony Falvo shipped off (literally ending up in the public affairs office of the USS Gerald Ford).

Today, a new coterie of AFRICOM public affairs personnel field questions, but Falvo’s successor, Deputy Director of Public Affairs John Manley, a genuine professional, seems to be on call whenever my questions are especially problematic. He swears this isn’t true, but I’m sure you won’t be shocked to learn that he fielded my queries for this article.

After Col. Tom Davis — who left AFRICOM to join Special Operations Command (where, in a private email, he called me a “turkey”) — failed to respond to my interview requests, I asked AFRICOM if his defer-and-deny system was the best way to inform the American public. “We are not going to comment on processes and procedures in place a decade ago or provide opinions on personnel who worked in the office at that time,” said Manley.

“Our responsibility is to provide timely, accurate, and transparent responses to queries received from all members of the media,” Manley told me. Yes, me, the reporter who’s been waiting since 2012 for answers about those U.S. bases. And by AFRICOM standards, maybe that’s not really so long, given its endless failures in quelling terrorism and promoting stability in places like Burkina Faso, Libya, and Somalia.

Still, I give Manley a lot of credit. He isn’t thin-skinned or afraid to talk and he does offer answers, although sometimes they seem so far-fetched that I can’t believe he uttered them with a straight face. Though he agreed to discuss his replies further, I doubted that badgering him would get either of us anywhere, so I’ll just let his last one stand as a digital monument to my 10-year relationship with AFRICOM. When I asked if the public affairs office had always been as forthcoming, forthright, and helpful with my queries as possible, he unleashed the perfect capstone to my decade-long dance with U.S. Africa Command by offering up just one lone word: “Yes.”",Q4

https://www.phillyvoice.com/bucks-county-murders-home-for-sale-solebury-cosmo-dinardo-kratz/,"Bucks County home tied to 2017 murders by Cosmo DiNardo, Sean Kratz listed for sale","The Solebury Township home where investigators found key evidence leading to the bodies of four young men murdered in 2017 has been listed for sale at a price of $700,000.

The property at 2827 Aquetong Road, once owned by the parents of confessed killer Cosmo DiNardo, was put on the market earlier this month. The three-bedroom, two bathroom home is described in the RE/MAX Aspire listing as a fully renovated, historic property that was built in 1821 and sits on just under an acre of land.

A shed on the property played a role in the homicide case that brought national attention to Bucks County more than five years ago. The four missing men were found on an 80-acre Solebury farm also owned by the Dinardos. The farm is less than a mile away, in the secluded area of Upper Mountain Road near Lower York Road.

DiNardo, now 25, pleaded guilty to killing the four men with the help of his cousin, Sean Kratz, having lured the victims to the farm under the guise of selling them marijuana. DiNardo and Kratz, who was convicted at trial for his involvement in three of the killings, are both serving life sentences.

The car of one of the victims, 21-year-old Thomas Meo, of Plumstead Township, was found in a shed on the Aquetong Road property during the course of a missing persons investigation that lasted more than a week that July. Inside the car, authorities also found the title to Meo's car, his keys and a diabetes kit that Meo needed to survive.

Days earlier, Meo and another victim, 22-year-old Mark Sturgis, of Pennsburg, had met DiNardo near Peddler's Village. They went with DiNardo to the property on Aquetong Road and Meo left his car in the shed. DiNardo then took the two men to the farm, where they expected to buy drugs, but DiNardo shot them both.

Meo was struck in the back and instantly paralyzed. Sturgis attempted to flee, but DiNardo shot him multiple times, killing him. DiNardo then got onto his father's backhoe and ran over Meo, authorities said.

In an earlier incident at the farm, DiNardo had killed 19-year-old Jimi Taro Patrick, of Newtown Township, who had met with him under similar circumstances. Two days after Meo and Sturgis were murdered, DiNardo and Kratz killed 19-year-old Dean Finocchiaro, of Middletown.

Together, DiNardo and Kratz doused three of the bodies in gasoline and burned them in a pig roaster. The bodies were found buried in a 12-foot-deep hole that DiNardo and Kratz dug using the backhoe on the farm. Patrick's body was found buried elsewhere on the farm after investigators agreed not to pursue the death penalty if DiNardo told them where the remains were hidden.

In recordings of DiNardo's confession that were later made public, no clear motive emerged for any of the murders. DiNardo didn't have significant connections to any of the victims, beyond lining up the drug deals.

Prior to the murders, DiNardo had a history of mental health issues and had been banned from visiting the campuses of Holy Ghost Prep and Arcadia University in Glenside due to behavioral issues. He previously had been involuntarily committed to a mental health facility and was legally prohibited from possessing a firearm.

Dinardo's mother, Sandra, purchased the Aquetong Road property in 2006 for $450,000, the Bucks County Courier Times reported. County property records show that she sold the property to Gina DiNardo for $1 last December. The DiNardos still own the farm property.

The murder case was featured in an Investigation Discovery special, ""The Lost Boys of Bucks County,"" that premiered in 2020. The two-hour documentary highlighted the work of Middletown Township police officer Megan Freer, who played an important role in identifying the farm where the victims' bodies were found. Freer received an Award of Valor at the National Liberty Museum in Philadelphia for her role in solving the case.",Q4

For years, the U.S. establishment scoffed at China’s technological ambitions. Now it’s ready to damage America’s high-tech industry in the hope of hurting China even more. This Jekyll-to-Hyde metamorphosis of America’s elite has nothing to do with China’s military expansion, the vulnerability of Taiwan, the nasty treatment of China’s Uyghur minority, or the suppression of dissidents in Hong Kong. It’s about elite privilege and money. After the Cold War, the American elite built wealth beyond the dreams of avarice out of the digital economy that America first created to defeat the Soviet Union. Now China threatens to dominate the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

The problem isn’t that China is advancing. It’s that we’re stuck in the mud. To win the Cold War, the federal government spent about 1% of GDP on the development part of R&D, the equivalent of $320 billion a year in current dollars. That gave us computer chips, lasers, optical networks, flat displays, the Internet, and everything else that went into the modern age. The Biden Administration offers $38 billion in subsidies to chipmakers over five years. We’re off by a zero. We put our top talent into social media, not the frontier of physics.

It seems like China is the only thing that both parties agree about. Count me out of the one-upmanship in China-bashing. If we want to stay ahead of China, we need to put our own house in order. Last year I told the Chinese website Observer: “I want China to be prosperous, secure, and a step behind the United States.”

In 2020, I published You Will Be Assimilated: China’s Plan to Sino-Form the World, with horse’s mouth reporting of Chinese plans to digitize the world economy. China wants to transform manufacturing, logistics, health care, and virtually every other sector of the world economy. It already has automated ports and warehouses that make Amazon facilities look like something out of Dickens. The establishment didn’t believe what was happening before it is eyes. China could make toasters for Walmart and assemble iPhones at Foxconn sweatshops but never take leadership in high tech.

Sometime early this year, the establishment rolled out of its figurative bed, rubbed its eyes, and realized that its franchise was at risk. Now it is bouncing off its figurative ceiling.

Two years earlier the Boston Consulting Group estimated that the U.S. providers would take a 37% hit to revenues if banned from selling to China. If that sounds exaggerated, recall that the Pentagon in early 2020 intervened to stop export controls on semiconductor equipment to just one Chinese company, namely Huawei, because the damage to American firms would be devastating. The Wall Street Journal reported on Jan. 20, 2020:

The Commerce Department’s efforts to tighten the noose on Huawei Technologies Co. is facing a formidable obstacle: the Pentagon. Commerce officials have withdrawn proposed regulations that would make it harder for U.S. companies to sell to Huawei from their overseas facilities following objections from the Defense Department as well as the Treasury Department, people familiar with the matter said. The Pentagon is concerned that if U.S. firms can’t continue to ship to Huawei, they will lose a key source of revenue—depriving them of money for research and development needed to maintain a technological edge, the people said. The chip industry has pressed that argument in talks with government officials. Defense Secretary Mark Esper was asked about The Wall Street Journal’s reporting on the concern during an appearance Friday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “We have to be conscious of sustaining those [technology] companies’ supply chains and those innovators,” Mr. Esper said. “That’s the balance we have to strike.”

Now the Biden administration has effectively banned sales of advanced equipment and design software to all of China, and there isn’t a peep from the Pentagon or anyone else. The Semiconductor Industry Association is silent. Intel’s CEO muses that the restrictions are “inevitable.” The establishment has reached a consensus, and it will enforce party discipline with a stringency that would make Stalin cringe. The echo chamber in the press will intone, “Human rights violations, surveillance state, military threat.”

What changed? China’s Uyghurs suffered forced assimilation for years. China had built enough missiles to sink U.S. carriers within a few hundred miles of its coast by no later than 2016.

It is strange to hear this from the National Commission on Artificial Intelligence (Mid-Decade Challenges to National Competitiveness), headed by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt:

American companies, and those in allied nations, have enabled the PRC’s chip breakthroughs. The United States and its allies must take stronger actions to block Beijing’s access to advanced chips. China is powering its AI ambitions and military modernization with advanced chips designed and built by firms based in the United States and allied countries. Policymakers must keep export controls and other policies current to the technology and threat, then place the onus on firms to demonstrate that sales of cutting edge chips to the PRC do not boost Beijing’s military modernization and human rights abuses.

For the past twenty-odd years, Big Tech got rich by selling expensive software to consumers who ran it on cheap hardware from China. The cost of computer memory fell to 1 cent per megabyte in 2020 from 70 cents in 2000 thanks in large part to China’s industrial machine, supporting trillion-dollar valuations for U.S. tech giants. After the dotcom crash of 2000, U.S. high-tech companies dumped their manufacturing businesses. Huawei became the top telecom infrastructure firm because Cisco didn’t want the business. Silicon Valley built China’s semiconductor industry because it didn’t want the trouble of manufacturing anything. Cisco’s and Google’s return on equity is about 30%, while Huawei earned single digits.

Now we are shocked — shocked — to discover that China has aspirations beyond assembling iPhones and that it would like to manufacture high-end chips just like its cousins in Taiwan.

It has finally dawned on Silicon Valley that China has more data than anyone else on which to train artificial intelligence systems and that if China can match this data — the fuel of the Fourth Industrial Revolution — to a corresponding engine, it will push its erstwhile Silicon Valley sponsors out of the way and pulp their trillion-dollar franchises. The ascent of TikTok at the expense of Instagram and other American tech leviathans was a wake-up call.

China is taking over vast swaths of the world, starting with its own Asian neighborhood, with industrial power. It has gained vast influence and economic advantage by leading the expansion of Asian economies. Its exports to Asia are now four times its exports to the U.S. or the European Union respectively.

China won’t sell more goods by invading Vietnam or Indonesia. Its Belt and Road strategy, leading with digital and physical infrastructure, locks the world’s most populous countries into China’s economic orbit and allows it to shift its labor-intensive industries to cheaper venues. This brings a lot of benefits to its trading partners. What should worry us is not what China does wrong but what it does right.

For the record, I do not like China. I don’t like its imperial system of governance, which resembles no Western institution more than the Mafia. I don’t like the food, the architecture, or the literature which, sadly, I can read only in translation. I prefer Homer or Shakespeare to the Romance of Three Kingdoms, and I prefer Kant to Confucius. But it would be churlish, indeed bigoted, not to respect its accomplishments. More people have risen from poverty to prosperity in the past generation in China than in any other place or time. For this, I give China one cheer of the proverbial three.

Biden’s chip restrictions will hurt China plenty. It remains to be seen whether China will hurt us even more. Meanwhile, China graduates seven engineers each year for every one of ours, with 20 of the world’s top 50 engineering schools in the US News ranking. Eventually, China will work around our controls. We can’t prevent the Chinese from reinventing chip technology, any more than British export controls stopped the U.S. from acquiring textile technology in the 1830s. What we can do is innovate faster. And that demands some big changes.",Q4

This article was published 02/10/2023 (502 days ago), so information in it may no longer be current.

When Ron DeSantis seemed to say during last week’s Republican presidential debate that he would support a federal ban on abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy, some anti-abortion activists called it the news they had been waiting months to hear.

The president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a leading anti-abortion advocacy group, issued a statement thanking DeSantis “for his commitment to support minimum federal protections for babies.”

But DeSantis’ campaign insisted his comment, which was the candidate’s most direct answer regarding an abortion ban, wasn’t anything new. And millions of voters probably missed the moment entirely.

DeSantis’ pledge came during one of many chaotic exchanges on the debate stage, when Sen. Tim Scott — who has made a nationwide ban on abortion at 15 weeks a central focus of his campaign — shouted a question, asking if the Florida governor also would support it. In a bit of barely audible crosstalk, DeSantis responded: “Yes, I will.”

The exchange and the DeSantis campaign’s response provided another example of the muddiness voters are encountering as they seek specific answers from Republicans regarding abortion policy. Since the Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that established a federal right to abortion, candidates are being pressed — and sometimes stopping short of a straight answer — on whether states should decide laws governing the procedure, as the court’s ruling allowed, or if the federal government should establish a standard law across all states. Some also are dodging questions about when they believe restrictions should occur and what exceptions, if any, should be allowed.

The variations on how far to go created a dust-up in the GOP presidential primary last month. Former President Donald Trump said during a TV interview that DeSantis made “a terrible mistake” by signing into law a ban on abortions in Florida at six weeks of pregnancy. Trump also said “it’s probably better” from a legal standpoint for abortion to be banned by individual states, rather than nationwide through federal action. The front-runner for the GOP nomination also said he would negotiate with Democrats on abortion legislation.

In states that hold elections in November, there has also been conflict among abortion opponents and accusations from Democrats that GOP candidates are trying to hide their true, extreme positions.

In Kentucky, where the state’s strict anti-abortion law has been a major issue as Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear seeks a second term, Republican Daniel Cameron appeared to redefine his position on the law twice in two weeks. In Ohio, anti-abortion activists are at odds over messaging and campaign strategy as they try to defeat a constitutional amendment that would protect abortion access in Ohio.

And Democrats in Virginia are hammering Republican candidates for the House and Senate, saying they will pass an extreme abortion ban similar to those in neighboring states if the GOP wins full control of state government. Virginia, which currently has divided government, is the only state in the South that hasn’t imposed new restrictions since Roe fell.

Virginia Republicans largely support Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s proposal that would prohibit the procedure at 15 weeks, with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother, and they accuse Democrats of fear-mongering and telling lies. Republicans also have called out Democrats for not wanting to limit abortion at all, though many Democrats favor existing Virginia law, which allows elective abortions in the first and second trimesters.

Abortions in the third trimester are rare and typically occur because of a significant fetal abnormality, experts say.

Democrats say the GOP is suddenly moderating only because of recent election results and advice from pollsters.

Political momentum on abortion has shifted dramatically since last year’s decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. Voters supported reproductive rights in all six states where a question was on the ballot last year, and Democrats have credited the fall of Roe for helping the party win big races in 2022, including control of the Senate.

Trump also has blamed some GOP midterm losses on how candidates handled the issue, acknowledging its political sensitivity. Speaking at the conservative Family Research Council last month he said that politically, “it’s a very tough decision for some people” and “very very hard on elections.”

The former president nominated three Supreme Court justices who formed a new conservative majority to overturn Roe v. Wade. Looking ahead to the general election, he has tried to position himself as more moderate on abortion than his GOP rivals, who must win over the more conservative primary electorate if they hope to be the Republican nominee.

About half of Americans say abortions should be permitted up to 15 weeks of pregnancy, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in June. The poll also found that 73% of all U.S. adults believe abortion should be allowed up to six weeks of pregnancy, which is when cardiac activity in a fetus may be detected and before women often know they’re pregnant.

In that same poll, 56% of Republicans said abortion should be allowed in their state up to 6 weeks and 29% supported making the procedure legal up to 15 weeks.

DeSantis signed Florida’s six-week ban last year without the fanfare of a major bill signing. After launching his presidential campaign weeks later, he has largely avoided specifics when talking about abortion.

During the first presidential debate in August he was asked directly whether he would support a federal abortion ban. DeSantis didn’t answer yes or no, but said he understands different states will handle the issue differently.

He also avoided a specific yes or no answer when asked about a 15-week ban by an Iowa radio station last month, saying “I’ve said from the beginning of this, as president, you put pro-life legislation on my desk, I’m going to look favorably and support the legislation.”

Last week, a debate moderator asked DeSantis about Republicans’ struggles to win moderate and independent voters in a state such as Arizona, where a reproductive rights question may be on the ballot in 2024. He disputed the idea that the GOP lost important contests last year because of abortion, countering Trump’s stance, then criticized Democrats for allowing abortion later in pregnancy.

“I think we should stand for what we believe in,” he said. “I think we should hold the Democrats accountable for their extremism.”

Seconds later, Scott shouted his question and DeSantis answered.

https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/i-team/come-back-or-i-destroy-your-life-fbi-says-warren-county-man-forced-underage-girls-to-be-online-sex-slaves,'Come back or I destroy your life': FBI says Warren County man forced underage girls to be online sex slaves,"CLEARCREEK TOWNSHIP — A Warren County man pleaded guilty to cyberstalking, seven years after FBI agents arrested him for giving ultimatums to underage girls online to be his sex slave or be killed.

Nicholas Edward Kurtz, who was 21 at the time, was living with his parents in Clearcreek Township when a tip from a 14-year-old girl in Wisconsin led law enforcement to him. Kurtz was arrested in September 2015, and he has been in the Butler County jail ever since.

But Kurtz may not be behind bars for much longer.

“I’ll get out in three months,” a shackled Kurtz whispered to supporters who sat behind him in U.S. District Court on Monday.

Kurtz signed a binding plea deal with federal prosecutors which guarantees him a time-served sentence, meaning he will be released from jail after his sentencing hearing in a few months. Afterward, he’ll be on supervised release for five years and get sex offender treatment, but he will not be required to register as a sex offender.

But U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Black declined to accept the plea at Monday’s hearing, saying he needs more time to learn about Kurtz. Black said he would make his final decision once a pre-sentence investigation report is done.

“I can’t make that decision today,” Black said. “When you come back for sentencing, I have to determine whether the proposed sentence of time served is sufficient.”

The judge also refused to allow Kurtz out of jail on bond to live near his parents' home in Lebanon.

If Black rejects the plea deal, Kurtz would be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea. Kurtz could decide to take his case to a jury. The maximum sentence for cyberstalking is life in prison.

The U.S. Attorney’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the plea deal.

“I was somewhat surprised at the leniency of the charges against him given the fact that there seem to be so many cases of abuse that they suspected and that some of them involve such egregious kind of threats,” said David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, who has monitored crimes against children for 25 years, and particularly crimes involving technology.

A federal grand jury indicted Kurtz in October 2015 on two counts of coercion and enticement, which are considered registerable offenses under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. But that indictment was dismissed on Monday when Kurtz pleaded guilty to the cyberstalking charge, which is not a registerable offense under the law.

“It wasn’t really clear to me why the prosecution settled the case that way,” Finkelhor said. “It’s particularly surprising because federal prosecutions tend to have more serious penalties.”

Kurtz’s attorneys have filed motions arguing that his right to a speedy trial was violated, but the judge declined to dismiss the case. His attorneys have also questioned the search of Kurtz’s parents’ home and other evidentiary issues.

“When prosecutions take this long, it’s really hard on the victims,” Finkelhor said. “The longer a case goes on, the harder it is for victims to recover.”

After Kurtz was arrested, Clearcreek Township police told the media at the time that there may be dozens more victims, according to multiple reports.

The FBI began investigating Kurtz in November 2014 with officers from Wisconsin after a 14-year-old girl said Kurtz threatened to rape and kill her if she didn’t do as he demanded, including mutilating herself and acting as his slave, according to an FBI affidavit from September 2015.

The girl said she met Kurtz, who was using the name Chase Rein, on the social media site Ask.fm in October 2014 when she was 13. He pretended to be a 17-year-old who lived in a foster community, and they developed a friendship through the Kik messenger application, Skype, text and video messages, according to the affidavit.

“Kurtz then told (her) that she had to call him ‘master’ and follow his demands to mutilate herself and send him nude pictures. Kurtz sent (her) a list of 100 rules of a slave and videos of how slaves act, and he told her to memorize the rules,” according to the affidavit.

The victim eventually ended her communication with Kurtz in November 2014 after confiding in and seeking help from a friend and school counselor. But a few months later Kurtz contacted her on Instagram and told he would kill her and her family if she did not communicate with him again, according to the FBI affidavit.

In one message exchange she wrote, “you don’t know where i live you cant hurt me..or the other people.”

Kurtz responded, “Yes. I actually do … Ok..I will be there in 2 weeks … I have to get guns first,” according to the affidavit.

The investigation led the FBI to other situations between Kurtz and girls between the ages of 12 and 16 in Virginia, Maryland, Michigan and New York, where he allegedly used threats and humiliation to coerce them into sending nude photos and sexually explicit videos online between 2013 and 2015.

“Talk to me. Or I will post your vid online,” Kurtz allegedly wrote to a 16-year-old girl in New York, in which he threatened to kill himself if she ignored him. “You are to message me right after your tutoring. If you don’t, I will take your parents with me,” according to the FBI affidavit.

Richard Ruggieri, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s Cincinnati office, declined to discuss Kurtz’s case. But he urged parents to talk to their children about online predators.

“The biggest thing in my opinion is be engaged with your kid, right? Know what’s going on. Know who their friends are,” Ruggieri said. “Being engaged and having a conversation with your child is in my opinion the first step.”

Parents should know what social media platforms their children are using. They should explain the difference between appropriate online behavior and red-flag conversations. And urge children to use electronic devices in public spaces, like the living room, so parents can monitor what’s going on, he said.

“I would suggest parents maybe share some of the stories from the public forum that are on the internet or the local police websites about the hazards of these things,” Ruggieri said.

The more sophisticated predators online start by being friendly to children, Finkelhor said.

“They look for vulnerabilities like kids who are lonely, kids who don’t have a lot of friends, kids who are having conflicts with their parents, and then they give them support and show concern … then they turn the conversation to more sexual things,” Finkelhor said.

“Sometimes you have offenders … they trick kids into providing images or say that they have information about them or know their location and begin to threaten them to provide images,” Finkelhor said. “Kids can be quite scared and intimidated by that and think they have no choice but to comply.""

If children do send photos or videos to a predator online, they could be extorted for money or to continue the relationship. Often predators will threaten to post the photos and videos online for friends and family to see.

“We’ve had cases, maybe not here in Cincinnati … where a young adult has sent a picture or a video. They’ve received extortion requirements, whatever they might be … and the victim on the sending end can’t handle it anymore and they commit suicide,” Ruggieri said. “It’s a horrible outcome, absolutely horrible outcome, and part of what we’re trying to talk with you about is - it doesn’t need to be that way.”

If parents are worried, Ruggieri encourages them to talk to their children and if need be, check their devices themselves or contact law enforcement.

These types of crime are a high priority for the FBI, Ruggieri said, “I’m in charge of all of our criminal programs here in Cincinnati and it's one of the busiest that I have in my branch.”

Finkelhor suggested that Kurtz’s alleged behavior is on the “extreme end of the spectrum.”

“I would imagine that somebody who has engaged in that kind of threatening behavior and has the suspicion of having so many victims … is somebody you would want to have on a sex offender registry,” said Finkelhor.",Q4
https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1010823-infructuous-plea-sc-disposes-of-petition-to-stop-ptis-long-march,SC disposes of petition to stop PTI's long march,"A policeman walks past the Supreme Court building in Islamabad, Pakistan. — AFP/File

ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Thursday disposed of a plea seeking orders to stop PTI Chairman Imran Khan's long march, observing that the apex court's interference on the matter would be ""premature"".



The SC told the petitioner a fresh plea could be filed if the law and order situation worsens in light of the long march.

""Prima facie, the court's interference on the issue would be premature [...] court will exercise judicial restraint in such political matters,"" Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial remarked while terming the plea infructuous.

The petition filed last week by JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza court had moved the top court to pass restraining orders to halt the long march, which is moving towards the federal capital with every passing day. The government has warned the party against engaging in violence once it enters Islamabad — which is expected by this week — with the party's assurance that it will not indulge in violence.

Today's hearing

The CJP presided over the three-member bench, comprising Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Ayesha Malik, that heard the plea.

At the outset of the hearing, Murtaza said it's been two weeks since Khan's long march kicked off, and according to PTI Senior Vice President, it will reach Islamabad by this Friday.

""Everyday life of people has been disrupted due to the long march. PTI reserves its right to hold a long march, but in no way is it allowed to disturb a commoner's life.""

At this, Justice Ayesha asked the lawyer whether the government had introduced a mechanism to regulate the protests. Justice Minallah also asked Murtaza whether he thought that the administration had become so weak that it could not handle the long march.

""This is a matter related to the executive [government], you should approach them,"" Justice Minallah told Murtaza, as he noted that in unusual circumstances, the court could intervene.

""When the administration has the authority to control the long march, why should the courts intervene?"" he wondered.

In response, Murtaza said things have gotten out of hand now as, during the long march, a person lost their life in Wazirabad — and Khan was also injured.

Then, Justice Ayesha asked the petitioner since the long march has been continuing now for so many days, did he approach the district administration.

'Difficult situation'

In his remarks, CJP Bandial told Murtaza that he had cited the violations of the previous long march and asked the court to intervene in the matter. ""But the long march is a political issue, there is a political solution to it as well.""

He told the petitioner that when the judiciary gets involved in political matters, it creates a ""difficult situation"" for the court.

""You have also cited an audio leak in your petition. In the audio, there is a conversation about bringing weapons [to Islamabad]. Whether or not this audio is real, there is a chance that the law and order situation might get affected,"" the CJP said.

He then asked whether the PTI brought weapons to Islamabad during its march on May 25 as he noted that there are certain limits that political parties should adhere to during protests.

CJP Bandial said that since the court was informed that the march was still in Punjab, then did the petitioner approached the province's government. And if that isn't the case, can the court intervene if the communication ties between the Centre and provinces are cut off?

Justice Minallah then told Murtaza that he was a senator and he should work to strengthen the parliament. At this, the JUI-F leader said that he was present in the court in a personal capacity.

""How can we believe that you're here in a personal capacity when you're also part of the government?"" Justice Minallah asked. Murtaza said it seems that the administration cannot control the situation, which is why he opted to move the court.

'Premature'

At this, the CJP said prima facie, the court's interference in the issue would be ""premature"".

Then, Justice Minallah grilled Murtaza and asked him whether he wanted the court to play the role of a deputy commissioner.

Justice Ayesha then informed Murtaza that a contempt case against Khan was already pending before the SC's larger bench.

""The parties — in the contempt case — have assured [us] of being answerable if there are any violations. So, do you still want this bench to intervene when a larger bench is already hearing a case?""

Justice Minallah also noted that a similar case was already being heard in the Islamabad High Court (IHC).

'Are you afraid?'

The chief justice remarked that the PTI had requested permission to hold the May 25 rally in H9 Ground.

""The Supreme Court interfered when the administration refused to provide the H9 ground,"" he said.

CJP Bandial said that the crowd moved to the D-Chowk despite the reservation of H9 ground. ""Are you afraid that the May 25-like incident could occur again?"" he asked.

At this, the additional attorney general informed the court that the administration asked the PTI to hold a rally in Rawat. He said that the administration sought PTI's response in an affidavit, which hasn't been filled as yet.

The official said that a similar case is under trial in IHC as well.

""The court will interfere if there is a clear risk of a constitutional violation,"" CJP remarked.

Meanwhile, JUI-F Senator Murtaza said that the plea contains a reference to the constitutional violations from the past.

At this, the CJP remarked that the other party may have their stance on the violations.

""The matter becomes complicated for the court after violation of an apex court's order. The judicial orders are for compliance,"" he said.

The plea

In his petition, JUI-F Senator Murtaza claimed that the PTI chairman seems to be on a collision course with the institutions of Pakistan as the party is once again carrying out its “long march” to Islamabad.

Senator Murtaza made federal and provincial governments, Khan, and his party respondents.

The petition prayed to the top court to ensure the basic rights of people were not violated during the long march.

The petition urged the court to order provinces and the federation to ensure that Islamabad’s population was off-limits for the PTI’s protest/sit-in.

It also appealed to the court to direct the Islamabad Capital Territory and provincial authorities not to allow long marchers to continue their protest for an indefinite period.

The PTI should also be ordered to comply with the rules and parameters that govern the code of conduct for holding protest rallies, the petition urged the court.",Q4
https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/education/2022/10/27/walters-nelson-clash-in-oklahoma-state-superintendent-debate/69593101007/,"State superintendent debate: Ryan Walters, Jena Nelson clash on numerous issues","Political rhetoric surrounding schools ratcheted up as the two candidates vying to become Oklahoma's top education official appeared in their only scheduled debate ahead of the Nov. 8 general election.

Republican Ryan Walters and Democrat Jena Nelson met Tuesday evening at the Fox 25 studio in Oklahoma City to debate on live TV. The general election victor will succeed state schools Superintendent Joy Hofmeister as the head of the Oklahoma State Department of Education and the chair of the Oklahoma State Board of Education.

Walters, 37, is a former history teacher who sits on Gov. Kevin Stitt's Cabinet as secretary of education. Nelson, 44, is an English language arts teacher at Oklahoma City's Classen Middle School of Advanced Studies. She was the 2020 Oklahoma Teacher of the Year.

Walters described schools as a ""civil war"" battleground with progressives on the opposing front.

""We have to continue to stay vigilant as the far left has decided that they’re going to launch a war for our kids’ minds and convince our young people that they are racist,"" Walters said. ""They’re going to inject this division into the classroom. They’re going to inject this hatred of the Constitution and the values this country was founded on.""

He specifically cited books ""Gender Queer"" and ""Flamer,"" which depict graphic sexual scenes, as pornographic books he claimed Nelson and other Democrats permit in schools. Tulsa Public Schools recently pulled both books from its libraries.

From Nelson's standpoint, public schools are full of hardworking educators trying to serve students with limited school resources. She has advocated for fully funded schools and a $5,000 teacher pay raise.

""Tonight I've been accused of a lot of different things — pushing pornography, which I never have,"" she said. ""I've also been accused of being some kind of left-wing indoctrinator, along with many teachers across the state, and that's not true either. I go into my classroom and I am in the presence of perpetual hope every single day, and it makes me want to go and fight harder for all of them so that they can have the same opportunity that I had.""

Hofmeister is term-limited after eight years in office. She switched to the Democratic Party last year and is Stitt's leading challenger in the gubernatorial race, a move that made her a frequent target in Walters' debate remarks.

Walters has been a vocal opponent of Critical Race Theory, a college-level concept on structural racism not typically taught in K-12 schools. He advocated for a bill regulating use of school bathrooms by birth sex, not gender identity, and repeatedly called for schools to teach that America is ""the greatest country in the history of the world.""

He recently suggested on the campaign trail he would put history teachers through patriotic training. He said too few students are well versed in U.S. history, and he suggested a teacher training course from the conservative Michigan-based Hillsdale College could improve education on America's founding.

Hillsdale College has opened charter schools across the country, including one planned for Tulsa next year. Nelson called Hillsdale a ""radical religious school.""

""I believe in the Constitution, and I believe in American history. I believe in teaching all history,"" she said. ""We don’t need indoctrination of our teachers.

""The product that is coming out of Hillsdale is not anything to do with patriotism, but indoctrination.""

Walters, whose campaign cornerstone is eliminating liberal indoctrination in schools, has been leery of accepting federal education funds. Before his Aug. 23 Republican runoff victory, he said he would reject all federal dollars from coming to Oklahoma schools.

He has since walked back that suggestion, clarifying he would accept federal money only if it benefits academics, is transparent and has no ""left-wing indoctrination"" attached.

School funding is a key dividing line between the two candidates.

Nelson has called for a larger state appropriation to education, particularly for higher teacher pay and better student mental health support. She said schools would be ""in a world of hurt"" without federal funds, which pay for cafeteria meals for impoverished students, special education, early childhood services and numerous other programs.

Meanwhile, Walters said Oklahoma schools have enough money to provide a quality education. The issue, he said, is how they're spending it.

Although a report from the state's legislative watchdog office found 58% of Oklahoma's K-12 education funding goes to teacher salaries and classroom resources, Walters claimed more than half of public-school dollars end up in administration.

He said he would ""absolutely"" support a plan to use public dollars to send students to private schools should such a measure come up in the state Legislature. A similar bill that proposed spending $128.5 million on private-school costs failed in an April state Senate floor vote.

Walters has been the staunchest proponent in the race of expanding school choice options.

Echoing Hofmeister, Nelson called private-school vouchers a ""rural school killer"" and a way to defund public education.

Walters, a father of four children of elementary age or younger, claimed his daughter was ridiculed at school by a student accusing her father of planning to steal $130 million from public schools.

He said such accusations are the result of Democrats' lies and repeatedly urged Nelson to correct the record.

""I'm sorry, buddy,"" Nelson said. ""It's not really in my nature to lie.""

Walters brushed off an unflattering federal audit as a ""lie"" and a ""Democrat talking point."" The U.S. Department of Education reported in June that Oklahoma families misspent more than $650,000 in pandemic relief funds because Walters and the Stitt administration failed to implement proper guardrails when handing out $1,500 grants from the Governor's Emergency Education Relief Fund (GEER).

Walters criticized Nelson and Hofmeister over their records on school closures during the pandemic.

Hofmeister and the state Board of Education required all public schools in the state to close for the last six weeks of the 2019-20 school year after the outbreak of COVID-19. The state superintendent then advocated for regulations requiring mask wearing and closures when COVID levels were high — measures the state board refused to make mandatory.

Nelson also appealed for a cautious approach against COVID spread while at a 2020 school board meeting in Deer Creek Public Schools, where she was a middle school teacher at the time. Parents who asked for a full return to five-day school weeks booed the Teacher of the Year at the meeting after she implored the board not to hastily abandon Deer Creek's hybrid class schedule.

""We were really focused on the doing the best we could,"" Nelson said. ""I wasn’t at Mustang High School promoting COVID classrooms like (Walters) and the governor were. We were trying to keep people safe.""

Walters and Stitt pushed for schools to remain open throughout COVID-19 to better meet students' academic and social needs. They piloted an in-school quarantine plan at Mustang High School.

Oklahoma's poor showing in state test scores, which indicated only a fraction of students performed on grade level in reading and math, are a product of school shutdowns, Walters said.

""We knew that kids could go to school and be safe,"" he said. ""(Nelson) is doubling and tripling down on a position that has proven to be wrong.""

https://www.abc15.com/news/national/authorities-investigating-after-some-us-airport-websites-go-offline,Authorities investigating after some US airport websites go offline,"The websites for some major U.S. airports went down early Monday in an apparent coordinated denial-of-service attack, although officials said flights were not affected.

The attacks followed a call by a shadowy group of pro-Russian hackers that calls itself Killnet for coordinated denial-of-service attacks on the targets. The group published a target list on its Telegram channel.

Security experts said that this type of attack is highly visible but not as dangerous as other forms of hacking.

""We noticed this morning that the external website was down, and our IT and security people are in the process of investigating,"" said Andrew Gobeil, a spokesman for Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. ""There has been no impact on operations.""

Portions of the public-facing side of the Los Angeles International Airport website were also disrupted, spokeswoman Victoria Spilabotte said. ""No internal airport systems were compromised and there were no operational disruptions.""

Spilabotte said the airport notified the FBI and the Transportation Security Administration, and the airport's information-technology team was working to restore all services and investigate the cause.

Several other airports that were included on Killnet's target list reported problems with their websites.

The Chicago Department of Aviation said in a statement that websites for O'Hare International and Midway airports went offline early Monday but that no airport operations were affected.

Last week, the same group of hackers claimed responsibility for cyberattacks against state government websites in several states.

John Hultquist, vice president for threat intelligence at the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, tweeted that denial-of-service attacks like those aimed at the airports and state governments are usually short in duration and ""typically superficial.""

""These are not the serious impacts that have kept us awake,"" he said.",Q4
https://www.wknofm.org/features/2022-10-18/civil-wrongs-episode-1-a-lynching-in-memphis,"Civil Wrongs, Episode 1: A Lynching in Memphis","This report is a collaboration between WKNO and the Institute for Public Service Reporting at the University of Memphis.

105 years ago, on a Tuesday morning, thousands of people headed to the outskirts of Memphis to watch a man be burned alive. It was just one of many brutal lynchings of the era, but also one covered in great detail by the media.

The story — one of racial profiling, false confessions and mob violence — is as much present as it is past. The road to civil rights is paved with civil wrongs.

Margaret Vandiver knows it well. We meet her near a used car lot on Summer Avenue, a little ways past the old drive-in movie theater.

""This is the part I was hoping would be mowed, but as you can see, anything but,"" says the retired University of Memphis professor, leading the way into this wooded area.

A quarter mile into thick brush, we are on the banks of a pond, the former footprint of the Wolf River. Vandiver points to power lines and a concrete structure on the other side, which once marked the course of the old Macon Road.

Christopher Blank/WKNO-FM Laura Faith Kebede interviews Margaret Vandiver at the site of the Ell Persons lynching.

On a spring morning, 15-year-old Antoinette Rappel got on her bike and headed to school. A search party found that bike two days later, a few hundred feet off the road. The girl’s belongings were still in the front basket. Her body was nearby.

As the newspapers of May 3, 1917 reported, it was no doubt murder. Her head had been cut off, apparently with an ax.

Three weeks later, in this same spot, a mob of thousands publicly executed the prime suspect. For Antoinette Rappel, this would not be justice served.

""Most of the evidence against him was preposterous,"" Vandiver says. ""There is no reason to suspect him more than any one of the other men who were in this area at that time.""

So why him? Let’s peel back the layers.

During the time of the First World War, Black woodcutters lived in the area near the Wolf River Bottoms, working largely for white landowners.

Ell Persons was one of them. So little is known about his life that reports differ on his age, ranging from 38 to 50.

At first, even police considered him an unlikely suspect. Crime scene evidence included a white coat and a white handkerchief, neither of which were commonly worn by Black laborers.

But the public was of a different mind. The papers reported that one local woodcutter hadn’t come to work the day of Antoinette’s disappearance. Persons, it was said, could not locate his ax.

Dr. Darius Young, a history professor at Florida A&M University, says the case against Persons was baseless, but it wasn’t unexpected.

""As I'm going back through the documents and looking at the previous months, I'm seeing all of this talk about Black folks voting in Memphis, which is something that's very unique when we talk about the South in 1916,"" Young says.

A prominent Black citizen named Robert Church Jr. — one of the country’s first Black millionaires — had recently organized and funded one of the largest Black voter registration drives in the country.

""In learning his story and him organizing over 10,000 Black men to vote the previous year that I started to understand the root of the racial tension in the city,"" Young says.

The city’s Black voting bloc — an estimated third of the electorate — could throw its weight behind whichever political party did more for the Black community.

""Locally, [the idea was] let me try to negotiate things where we can get some concessions,"" Young says. ""Can we get a school? Can we get sidewalks? Can we get a park?""

White political panic had already prompted a crackdown on Beale Street’s Black-owned businesses.

It’s why racist dogwhistles, like “brute,” appear early on in newspaper articles about the Rappel killing. And how the slimmest circumstantial evidence put Ell Persons in the crosshairs.

For example, Persons’ white boss had fired him a few months earlier for allegedly frightening his boss’s wife.

Vandiver says the only so-called forensic evidence was the outlandish belief that human eyes imprinted the last image seen before death.

""They actually took this seriously enough to exhume the body of Antoinette Rappel,"" Vandiver says. ""One of her eyes had decomposed; they examined the other one. The Commercial Appeal said that in her eye there was an image of a large- featured man. The News Scimitar said that in her eye there was an image of Ell Persons.""

After questioning Persons twice and finding no evidence he was involved, Sheriff deputies conducted a brutal interrogation. Two detectives, “coaxed, cajoled, beat, whipped, [and] threatened” him. They ultimately claimed they found human blood on Persons’ shoes, an assertion later determined false by an NAACP investigation. A local paper, the Memphis Press, reported that Persons then confessed to the crime and was immediately whisked to a jail in Nashville to avoid a lynching.

Sheriff Mike Tate tried to conceal Persons’ return to Memphis for trial. But mob leaders abducted him from the train in Potts Camp, Miss., just south of Holly Springs.

On the morning of May 22, they brought him to the site of Antoinette Rappel’s murder. An estimated five to fifteen thousand people came to watch the spectacle.

Food vendors sold drinks and sandwiches.

What happened next was so widely reported, that the famed writer James Weldon Johnson, author of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” made his own journey to Memphis to record its aftermath for the newly organized NAACP.

Here is what Johnson wrote of the incident:

On the day I arrived in Memphis, Robert R. Church drove me out to the place where the burning had taken place. A pile of ashes and pieces of charred wood still marked the spot. While the ashes were yet hot, the bones had been scrambled for as souvenirs by the mobs. I reassembled the picture in my mind: a lone Negro in the hands of his accusers, who for the time are no longer human; he is chained to a stake, wood is piled under and around him, and five thousand men and women, women with babies in their arms and women with babies in their wombs, look on with pitiless anticipation, with sadistic satisfaction while he is baptized with gasoline and set afire. The mob disperses, many of them complaining, “They burned him too fast.” I tried to balance the sufferings of the miserable victim against the moral degradation of Memphis, and the truth flashed over me that in large measure the race question involves the saving of black America’s body and white America’s soul.

The sheer brutality of Ell Persons’ lynching wasn’t just a miscarriage of justice. It was an intentional warning to Memphis’ newly empowered Black community. Over a century later, the incident is still coming into focus as Memphis — and America — confront its dark history.

The Biden administration has approved the potential sale of Volcano anti-tank munition-laying systems to Taiwan for an estimated $180 million, the State Department announced on Dec. 28.

The possible sale comes as tensions between communist Beijing and liberal-democratic Taiwan continue to escalate.

According to a statement from the U.S. State Department, the Biden administration notified Congress on Wednesday of its approval of the potential arms sale, and other related equipment, in accordance with U.S. law.

“This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,” the statement said. “The proposed sale will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region.”

In a separate statement , Taiwan’s defense ministry said that the sale would be effective in roughly one month and that the move marked Washington’s eighth arms sale to the self-ruled island under Biden, which it said “fully demonstrated the U.S. government’s high regard for Taiwan’s defense capabilities.”

Systems to Boost Taiwan’s ‘Asymmetrical Warfare Capabilities’ According to the defense ministry, the sale also includes M977A4 HEMTT 10-Ton cargo trucks upon which the Volcano system will be mounted, M87A1 Anti-Tank (AT) munitions, M88 canister training munitions, M89 training munitions, and related logistics support and technical assistance.

The equipment will serve to significantly boost Taiwan’s “asymmetrical warfare capabilities,” the statement said.

Tensions between communist China and Taiwan, a U.S. ally, have soared this year and were further exacerbated by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) visit in August.

The Chinese regime, which claims Taiwan as its own, said at the time it was strongly opposed Pelosi’s visit and other governments or international organizations forming ties with Taiwanese officials.

Shortly after Pelosi returned to the United States, Beijing ramped up military activity near Taiwan, launching live fire drills and 11 ballistic missiles into waters around the island.

Tensions rose again on Dec. 26 when the CCP sent 71 planes and seven ships around the island during a 24-hour period shortly after President Joe Biden on Dec. 23 signed the National Defense Authorization Act for 2023, which included funding and support for Taiwan.

Previously in September, the administration approved more than $1.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan; marking the largest sales package since Biden took office.

Taiwan Extends Mandatory Military Service Earlier on Dec. 27, President Tsai Ing-wen Earlier on Dec. 27, President Tsai Ing-wen announced that Taiwan will extend its mandatory military service from four months to one year in 2024 in an effort to bolster military readiness in the event of an attack from Beijing.

“As long as Taiwan is strong enough, it will be the home of democracy and freedom all over the world, and it will not become a battlefield,” Tsai told a news conference announcing the decision, which she described as “incredibly difficult.”

“As the head of military forces, it is my unavoidable duty to defend national interests and our democratic way of life,” Tsai said. “No one wants war, Taiwan and Taiwanese people are the same, and the international community is the same,” she said, noting that the Chinese communist regime has stepped up its military aggression in recent months.

The White House welcomed the new conscription reform, which will apply to men born after 2005, saying it underscores “Taiwan’s commitment to self-defense and strengthens deterrence.”

In a statement to CNN, a White House spokesperson also reiterated U.S. support for Taiwan, stating that the Biden administration will continue to assist the nation in “maintaining a sufficient self-defense capability in line with our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act and our one-China policy.”

“The United States will continue to support a peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues, and oppose any unilateral changes in the status quo by either side,” the spokesperson added.",Q4

Kanye West, 46, apparently told Elon Musk, 52, he thinks he’s autistic and not bipolar, in newly released text messages. A screenshot of the alleged text messages sent to the Tesla CEO was posted by the rapper’s friend and stylist, Ian Conner’s Instagram account, at the request of him.

“When are we going to speak. You owe me nothing,” Kanye wrote in a text, allegedly sent to Elon. “You never have to speak to me again. But if we do speak The nature of the relationship has to change I’m not bipolar I have signs of autism from my [2002] car accident.”

Kanye then seemed to mention his ex-wife Kim Kardashian and the four children they share. “You can’t watch Kim keep my kids from me. And not say anything publicly and then call yourself my friend so I can bring my audience to your struggling platform,” some of the messages read.

The messages were posted to Ian’s Instagram after Kanye apparently asked him to “get this out to the public.” Ian captioned the post with, “2:25 a.m,” and received a lot of comments full of opinions about the text message exchange.

Kanye’s alleged text messages to Elon come after the Twitter-turned-X CEO banned the “Jesus Walks” creator from the social media platform last year for making antisemitic comments. They also come after Kim claimed that her then husband was bipolar and supposed to be on medication in 2019. She also said that he at one point, he believed he was just sleep deprived, but accepting the diagnosis later on had given him a sense of purpose.

“For him, being on medication is not really an option, because it just changes who he is,” she told Vogue at the time.

Kanye, himself, has also spoken publicly about being bipolar. He explained that his mental state “drives more of how he feels” and expressed the importance of speaking more about mental health and therapy in general, during an interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2018.",Q4
https://www.sunjournal.com/2022/10/16/austin-bay-the-iguala-massacre-and-cover-up-expose-mexicos-deep-state-corruption/,Austin Bay: The Iguala Massacre and cover-up expose Mexico’s Deep State corruption,"On his inauguration day in December 2018, Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO is his acronym) invoked a word that still transfixes Mexicans who seek honest government. The word: impunity.

In his inaugural address, AMLO swore that under his administration, “corruption and impunity” will end.

Why was that significant? Because if he pulled it off, AMLO would transform Mexico into a modern democracy. Like, something a talking head would call Canada South.

Now for the obvious bad news: AMLO has failed.

Critical background: For angry and disenchanted Mexican citizens, “impunity” means embedded injustice within their nation’s governing institutions and society. When shouted by protesters, it expresses deep disgust with political and economic leaders who cannot — or worse, will not — combat it.

Why don’t they?

I’m throwing a curve here. Why would the FBI and major American media try to hide the obvious corruption revealed by Hunter Biden’s laptop?

We will come back to that in a moment.

Sept. 26 was the eighth anniversary of the Iguala Massacre (sometimes called the Ayotzinapa Teachers College massacre). The Iguala Massacre is a vicious crime become political cause that exemplifies the evil of “impunity.”

In a column published after AMLO’s inauguration I wrote, “Impunity directly connects to the Iguala mass kidnappings of Sept. 2014, when 43 students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers’ College in Guerrero state were murdered. International investigators concluded the (government of then-president Enrique Pena Nieto’s) investigation was seriously flawed.

AMLO promised to establish a truth commission to answer the questions (related to the massacre) that the Pena administration failed to answer. Two days after his inauguration, he posed for a photo with the parents of the missing students.

With that photo, AMLO put his legacy on the line.”

In the last 30 days AMLO’s grand commitment to justice has floundered and succumbed to Mexico’s corrupt deep state of billionaire oligarchs, corrupt politicians, corrupt cops and corrupt courts.

Bottom line truth: the students were murdered. Several were tortured before they were slain. Some of their remains were hacked with machetes and burned; about 10 bodies were dissolved in acid.

Who did it? A drug gang named Guerreros Unidos was involved. Allegedly, the gang had ties to Iguala’s mayor.

Also involved: members of the Mexican military.

On Sept. 14 it appeared AMLO might keep his word and attack Deep State corruption. That day authorities arrested Gen. (retired) Jose Rodriguez Perez and two former soldiers for participating in the murder of 43 students at Ayotzinapa Teachers College near the town of Iguala (Guerrero state) on Sept. 26, 2014.

In 2014 Rodriguez commanded the Mexican Army battalion stationed in Iguala. In 2020 Rodriguez and the two other soldiers were convicted of being involved in organized crime.

But after Sept. 14 the Mexican national Attorney General’s Office canceled arrest orders for 21 Iguala massacre suspects. Sixteen Mexican Army soldiers were among the 21.

The special prosecutor charged with investigating Iguala resigned in disgust.

After the special prosecutor resigned, someone leaked to the press a study by AMLO’s Truth Commission that indicated the special prosecutor lacked “police assistance” in his investigation.

The leaks indicated the Mexican military ordered the executions and then turned the students over to the drug gang.

Hideous? Yes. Murky? Of course, intentionally so. Fact worthy of a psycho-thriller: The head of Mexico’s now-defunct Criminal Investigation Agency during the Pena administration is hiding in Israel. Israel and Mexico do not have extradition agreements.

You’re horrified? Good. I am too.

Unfortunately, the U.S. is poorly positioned to criticize Mexico. Think about America since early 2016. Consider the FISA court corruption to target Carter Page, an innocent man accused of being a traitor. Or the FBI using totally fake accusations cooked up by the Hillary Clinton campaign to target Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. Add FBI corruption to suppress public knowledge of Hunter Biden’s laptop and its hard evidence of influence peddling and tax evasion.

At least Mexican media demands prosecution and punishment for the Iguala massacre. Russian collusion? Major U.S. media proved to be as crooked as the FBI and Hillary Clinton’s paid operatives.

Rivera’s mother and fiancé also made a plea to the judge to keep Thavychith in jail and deny him bond.

“All we want is for him to be kept in prison where he belongs because his actions speak louder than anything else in regards to the person that he is,” his mother said. “If he did that to my son, what are the chances of him doing it again to anybody else.”

Thavychith’s lawyer argued that his client was not a flight risk due to the fact he was the one who called the authorities to turn himself in. The attorney also questioned whether it was actually Thavychith caught in the surveillance video on the night of the shooting.

When Judge Diane Kiesel dismissed the murder charge against Tracy McCarter for the 2020 death of her estranged husband, she criticized media coverage of the case. In her December 2 ruling, Kiesel noted that McCarter’s case “became the focus of an intense advocacy campaign which received extensive attention in the press.” The New York state Supreme Court judge added that nearly all of the coverage “adopted the defendant’s narrative that she was the victim of domestic violence and that prosecuting her for killing her husband was unjust.” The 11-page decision is replete with references to coverage of the case, including my reporting for The Nation.

As I reported, McCarter was arrested on March 2, 2020, for the death of her husband, James Murray, which she maintained in legal filings was the result of Murray falling on a knife she had grabbed to ward off his attacks that night. Following her arrest, McCarter spent six months in jail on Rikers Island, as Covid-19 was raging, despite not having been indicted. In September of that year, while campaigning for district attorney, Alvin Bragg tweeted that prosecuting abuse survivors who act in self-defense is unjust, referencing my Gothamist story about McCarter’s legal ordeal.

This past summer, I interviewed McCarter and three of her children about the rippling effects the murder charge has had on their lives for a Nation feature. McCarter was unable to resume working as a nurse; she also missed the births and early months of her first grandchildren. After several protests and prominent advertisements calling for Bragg to drop the charges, other media outlets eventually picked up her story. By the time Bragg appeared in person to argue for the dismissal on November 28, journalists filled nearly half the courtroom.

In her decision, Kiesel pointed to Bragg’s tweet and the subsequent media coverage, writing, “The case has reached the point where the public could perceive this dismissal as bought and paid for with campaign contributions and political capital.” But other trials, including the Anna Sorokin trial, which Kiesel presided over, have also garnered substantial media attention, yet no one accuses them of being “bought and paid for” with “political capital.”

According to Kiesel, a trial “doesn’t punish victims of domestic violence; it ensures that cases are decided solely on their individual merits, by a fair and impartial jury.” That has not been the experience of abuse survivors seated at the defense table who must relive every instance of trauma and violence while the threat of a decades-long prison sentence hangs over their heads.

“It sure feels like being penalized when the DA is cross-examining the DV victim,” one survivor, imprisoned for over 30 years in New York, told me. Another, incarcerated for more than 15 years in California, said that in continuing to traumatize victims, the legal system takes on the role of the abuser. Other imprisoned survivors recounted how their testimonies about abuse were disbelieved and discredited. One recalled that the judge accused her of lying about the abuse before sentencing her to 25 to life.

In the more than two and a half years that I have been covering McCarter’s case, I have yet to find national data on how many survivors are prosecuted or imprisoned for defending themselves or for other abuse-related convictions—because that data doesn’t exist. The little information available shows that prosecuting survivors is quite common: One New York study found that 67 percent of women imprisoned for killing a person close to them had been abused by that person. A California study found an even higher rate: 93 percent of women imprisoned for killing their partners had been abused by them. These rates are why New York lawmakers passed the Domestic Violence Survivors Justice Act, allowing judges to consider shorter sentences for survivors convicted of abuse-related crimes. But the law applies only after a survivor has gone through trial or pled guilty. Furthermore, judges have the discretion not to apply it, and some don’t.

McCarter’s case is unusual not because she faced prosecution but because she, her family, her legal team, and her supporters worked together to push past the initial flurry of tabloid headlines to spotlight the role domestic violence and alcoholism played in Murray’s tragic death.

In response to the judge’s ruling, McCarter said, via a press statement, “I am innocent. And I am devastated that on March 2, 2020, a man whom I loved lost his life. We were both the victims of the cruel disease of alcoholism. Dismissing the unjust charge against me can’t give back what I’ve lost, but I am relieved that this nightmare will finally be over, and I am determined to thrive once again.”",Q4
https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/donald-mceachin-obit-november-28-2022,Rep. Donald McEachin passes away at 61 after battle with colorectal cancer,"RICHMOND, Va. -- Virginia Congressman Donald McEachin (D - Richmond) passed away on Monday at the age of 61.

Tara Rountree, McEachin's Chief of Staff, said that the congressman passed following a battle with colorectal cancer.

McEachin was first elected to Virginia's 4th District in 2016. Earlier this month, he was reelected for his fourth term in Congress, where he lent his voice and support to protecting civil rights and LGBTQ rights.

He was also outspoken for equality, curbing gun violence and environmental protection.

According to The Washington Post, he was the third-ever African American to represent Virginia in the U.S. House.

McEachin is survived by his wife, Richmond Commonwealth's Attorney Colette McEachin and their three adult children — Mac, Briana and Alexandra.

Earlier this month, McEachin attended a premiere for ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" where he shared his personal health battles in a packed theater.

""I can't stress to you enough the importance of early detection,"" McEachin said. ""I know many of you have watched my journey and I've had a number of health issues. Nearly every one of the issues he's had is related to the radiation he had to deal with my colon cancer, my rectal cancer actually.""

He urged the crowd to get regular exams.

""Don't fool around. Don't go through my journey. Go to the doctor,"" McEachin said.

Rountree shared the following statement on Monday night.

We are all devastated at the passing of our boss and friend, Congressman Donald McEachin. Valiantly, for years now, we have watched him fight and triumph over the secondary effects of his colorectal cancer from 2013. Tonight, he lost that battle, and the people of Virginia’s Fourth Congressional District lost a hero who always, always fought for them and put them first. Until a new representative is elected, our office will remain open and continue to serve our constituents. The family asks for privacy at this time. Arrangements will be announced over the next few days.

In a statement shared on Monday night, Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney called McEachin a ""true public servant"" and asked for the city to send him and his family prayers.

Thank you for your service to our community, Rep. McEachin. May God bless you and your family. pic.twitter.com/BSYEaGANO3 — Mayor Levar M. Stoney (@LevarStoney) November 29, 2022

Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin also shared a statement about McEachin on Monday night, saying the congressman was a ""valiant fighter until the end"".

It’s so sad to learn of the passing of @RepMcEachin. A valiant fighter until the end, he admirably served Virginia & worked tirelessly to improve the lives of his constituents & Americans. Suzanne & I are thinking of his family, friends, & community during this difficult time. — Governor Glenn Youngkin (@GovernorVA) November 29, 2022

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called her late colleague “a tireless champion for Virginia families and a force for economic opportunity and environmental justice.”

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., released a statement saying: “Up until the very end, Don was a fighter. Even though he battled cancer and faced other trials in recent years, he never lost his focus on social and environmental justice. Tonight, Virginia has lost a great leader and I have lost a great friend.”

Rep. Gerry Connelly, D-Va., called McEachin an “environmentalist, civil rights advocate, faithful public servant, and a man of consequence. There was no better ally to have.”

Aston Donald McEachin was born Oct. 10, 1961, in Nuremberg, Germany. His father was an Army veteran and his mother a school teacher.

He graduated from St. Christopher’s School in Richmond in 1979, then earned a bachelor’s degree at American University in 1982 and a law degree at the University of Virginia in 1986. He earned a master of divinity degree at Samuel DeWitt Proctor School of Theology at Virginia Union University in 2008.

A lawyer in private practice during his career, he served in the House of Delegates from 1996-2002 and 2006-2008 and then the state Senate from 2008-2016.

The crash took place in Brooks County, Texas, approximately 80 miles inland from the Texas-Mexico border.

Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Lt. Christopher Olivarez tweeted photos from a rollover crash that resulted from a human smuggler evading apprehension by police.

Brooks County Sheriff Benny Martinez told Breitbart Texas that two vehicles, an Ford F-150 pickup and an Excursion SUV past a deputy parked on the side FM 755. The deputy observed the two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed. The deputy turned around to go after the vehicles but they were too far ahead of him to engage.

The drivers of the two vehicles lost control in an area known as “dead man’s curve,” Martinez explained. The pickup truck rolled and struck a gas pipeline. The Excursion ran head-on into a tree.

The rollover crash left two migrants dead and 12 others injured. One migrant died at the scene while the other died after being transported to Christus Spohn Hospital in nearby Kingsville, Texas. The driver reportedly left the scene of the crash.

Emergency crews transported the 12 injured migrants to three separate hospitals in Kingsville, Alice, and Edinburg.

Migrants in the vehicles said there could have been as many as 25 migrants in the two smuggling vehicles. The following day, more migrants walked out of the brush and had to be transported to area hospitals.

Martinez said the truck was registered in Houston and was not reported stolen. The sheriff was not able to release any additional information about the vehicles at this time.

The nationalities, ages, and genders of the deceased migrants is not known at this time. Lt. Olivarez told Breitbart Texas they have no leads on the driver who abandoned the dead and injured migrants. DPS troopers are continuing the investigation.

Sheriff Martinez told Breitbart that these kinds of crashes are not uncommon in his county which is not even located along the Texas border with Mexico. These crashes frequently lead to deaths, injuries, and the destruction of private property.

Earlier this year, a fleeing alleged human smuggler crashed into a tractor-trailer while attempting to evade arrest by a deputy, Breitbart Texas reported. That crash resulted in injury to the driver and a migrant. Six other migrants managed to avoid injury, Martinez stated.

Nearly a year earlier, a human smuggler crashed a van into a light pole while attempting to turn too quickly in an overloaded vehicle. Ten people died in the crash and 20 others were injured, Breitbart Texas reported.

So far this year, more than 80 migrants have been found dead in Brooks County, according to reports provided to Breitbart by Sheriff Martinez’s office.

The sheriff said the fatal crash is being investigated by Texas DPS troopers. The crimes related to human smuggling resulting in the deaths and injuries of migrants is being investigated by his office and ICE Homeland Security Investigations.

But now the Tesla and SpaceX boss is in control of the social media platform.

Here is a timeline of how the deal unfolded:

– April 4: A filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows Mr Musk bought up just over 9% of Twitter shares, at the time making him the firm’s largest shareholder.

Elon Musk (Brian Lawless/PA)

– April 5: Twitter announces Mr Musk would be joining the company’s board.

– April 11: Mr Musk reverses his decision and Twitter confirms the billionaire will not be joining the board.

– April 14: Mr Musk submits an offer to buy the company outright and take it private. He offers 44 billion US dollars (£36.5 billion) – or 54.20 US dollars (£45) per share.

– April 15: In response, Twitter plans to implement what is known as a “poison pill” policy, which would allow existing shareholders to buy stock at discounted rates to dilute Mr Musk’s holdings and prevent the sale. But Mr Musk and Twitter enter into negotiations over a deal.

– April 25: A deal is agreed on the price Mr Musk initially offered – 44 billion US dollars.

– May 10: During a public appearance, Mr Musk says he would reverse Twitter’s current permanent ban on the account of former US president Donald Trump.

– May 14: Mr Musk begins to raise questions over the number of bot accounts on the platform and says the deal is “temporarily on hold” while he tries to find out more about the levels of spam and fake accounts on Twitter.

– May 16: Mr Musk continues to spar publicly with Twitter executives, sending a poo emoji in response to a tweet from Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal which reiterates the firm’s belief that only 5% of accounts on the site are bots.

Mr Musk also uses a public appearance later that day to suggest a deal for the platform could be done at a lower price and estimates that Twitter is, at best, 20% bots.

– May 17: Mr Musk says the deal “cannot move forward” until he gets “proof” that bots are only 5% of spam accounts on the platform. A number of experts suggest he is trying to force the renegotiation of the deal at a lower price.

On the same day, Twitter says it still planned to “close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement” with Mr Musk.

– June 6: Mr Musk says he has a “right to terminate the merger agreement” in a letter from his lawyers to Twitter’s legal team over what he claims is the company’s lack of co-operation over the spam accounts data.

– June 8: Twitter agrees to give Mr Musk access to its data “firehose” which contains the data around all public tweets to help with his investigation.

The Twitter app (Lauren Hurley/PA)

– July 7: The Washington Post reports that Mr Musk’s deal to buy Twitter is “in peril” after his team concluded Twitter’s figures on spam accounts are not verifiable.

– July 8: The deal collapses after Mr Musk sends a letter to the SEC saying he is terminating the acquisition.

In the letter, he says Twitter has “not complied with its contractual obligations” surrounding the deal, namely giving him enough information to “make an independent assessment of the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on Twitter’s platform”.

In response, the chair of Twitter’s board, Bret Taylor, said it is “committed” to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement.

– July 12: Twitter launches legal action. Mr Musk later countersues, accusing the company of misleading his team about the true size of its user base and other problems he said amounted to fraud and breach of contract.

– July 19: Judges in the US state of Delaware set a date in October for the trial.

– August 5: Court documents show that Twitter accused Mr Musk of “looking for an excuse” to get out of the deal because the stock market decline meant it was no longer favourable for him.

– August 6: Mr Musk publicly comments on how he can move forward with the deal in response to a Twitter user who posts a series of tweets about the bid.

He says: “Good summary of the problem. If Twitter simply provides their method of sampling 100 accounts and how they’re confirmed to be real, the deal should proceed on original terms. However, if it turns out that their SEC filings are materially false, then it should not.”

– August 23: A former company executive at Twitter turned whistleblower, Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, says the microblogging website has substantial security problems that place personal user data and potentially national security at risk.

In response, Twitter disputes Mr Zatko’s account, describing it as a “false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies”.

– October 4: Twitter said it plans to close a deal to sell the company to Mr Musk after receiving an offer.

– October 6: A judge delays the looming trial between Twitter and Mr Musk in order to give the billionaire time to complete the acquisition.

Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in! pic.twitter.com/D68z4K2wq7 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 26, 2022

– October 26: Mr Musk posts a video of himself entering Twitter’s head office in San Francisco, just days before the court deadline to complete the deal.

He also changes his Twitter bio to refer to himself as Chief Twit and updates his location to Twitter headquarters in a sign the deal looks set to be closed.

Massachusetts Department of Public Health and Commissioner Margret Cooke, in Her Official Capacity

Washington, DC – The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) worked with Google to auto-install spyware on the smartphones of more than one million Commonwealth residents, without their knowledge or consent, in a misguided effort to combat Covid-19. Such brazen disregard for civil liberties violates the United States and Massachusetts Constitutions and cannot stand. The New Civil Liberties Alliance, a nonpartisan, nonprofit civil rights group, has filed a class-action lawsuit, Wright v. Massachusetts Department of Public Health, et al., challenging DPH’s covert installation of a Covid tracing app that tracks and records the movement and personal contacts of Android mobile device users without owners’ permission or awareness.

Plaintiffs Robert Wright and Johnny Kula own and use Android mobile devices and live or work in Massachusetts. Since June 15, 2021, DPH has worked with Google to secretly install the app onto over one million Android mobile devices located in Massachusetts without obtaining any search warrants, in violation of the device owners’ constitutional and common-law rights to privacy and property. Plaintiffs have constitutionally protected liberty interests in not having their whereabouts and contacts surveilled, recorded, and broadcasted, and in preventing unauthorized and unconsented access to their personal smartphones by government agencies.

Once “automatically installed,” DPH’s contact tracing app does not appear alongside other apps on the Android device’s home screen. The app can be found only by opening “settings” and using the “view all apps” feature. Thus, the typical device owner remains unaware of its presence. DPH apparently decided to secretly install the contact tracing app onto over one million Android devices because few Massachusetts citizens were downloading its initial version, which required voluntary adoption. DPH decided to mass-install the app without device owners’ knowledge or consent. When smartphone owners delete the app, DPH simply re-installs it. Plaintiffs’ class-action lawsuit contains nine counts against DPH, including violations of their Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution, and violations of Articles X and XIV of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.

No statutory authority supports DPH’s conduct, which serves no public health purpose, especially since Massachusetts has ended its statewide contact-tracing program. No law or regulation authorizes DPH to secretly install any type of software—let alone what amounts to spyware designed specifically to obtain private location and health information—onto the Android devices of Massachusetts residents. The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts should grant injunctive relief, along with nominal damages, to the class. NCLA is unaware at this time of other states that engaged in a similar surreptitious strategy of auto-installing contact-tracing apps. It appears Massachusetts iPhone users had to consent before a similar app installed on their devices.

NCLA released the following statements:

“Many states and foreign countries have successfully deployed contact tracing apps by obtaining the consent of their citizens before downloading software onto their smartphones. Persuading the public to voluntarily adopt such apps may be difficult, but it is also necessary in a free society. The government may not secretly install surveillance devices on your personal property without a warrant—even for a laudable purpose. For the same reason, it may not install surveillance software on your smartphone without your awareness and permission.”

— Sheng Li, Litigation Counsel, NCLA

“The Massachusetts DPH, like any other government actor, is bound by state and federal constitutional and legal constraints on its conduct. This ‘android attack,’ deliberately designed to override the constitutional and legal rights of citizens to be free from government intrusions upon their privacy without their consent, reads like dystopian science fiction—and must be swiftly invalidated by the court.”

— Peggy Little, Senior Litigation Counsel, NCLA

Tamar Andrews, who had worked with the unaccredited K-8 school since July, had previously held roles in early childhood education at Temple Isaiah of Los Angeles and American Jewish University.

“Dr. Andrews immediately resigned from Donda Academy following Ye West’s tweet,” Temple Isaiah president Allison Samek said in a statement to THR. “Her last day was October 11, 2022 as she felt she could no longer support the organization.”

On Thursday, the Simi Valley school announced that it would be closing effective immediately. The decision was made by West (who has changed his legal name to Ye), according to a report from ESPN.com.

Andrews’ resignation comes after the rapper promoted Jewish conspiracy theories in interviews and on social media earlier this month, tweeting that he would go “death con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE,” and claiming that Jews ‘have owned the Black voice.”",Q4

HARTLAND, Wis. -- The six people found dead after an apartment fire in a Wisconsin village last week had been shot in an apparent case of murder-suicide, according to police.

The bodies of a couple and their four children were found Friday after firefighters were called to their burning apartment in Hartland. Ten of the remaining tenants in the four-unit building made it out safely.

Hartland Police Chief Torin Misko said each of the victims had one gunshot wound. Connor McKisick, a father and stepfather to the four children, had a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Misko said.

The others who died were Jessica McKisick, a 14-year-old girl, a 12-year-old girl and two 3-year-old boys, all lived with Connor McKisick in one of the apartments. Police did not identify the children, but officials at the schools the girls attended said the victims were Natalie Kleemeier and her younger sister Sofina Kleemeier.

Misko said there was also evidence of an ignitable liquid in the apartment, and that multiple guns were found.

""This is a tragic incident for the family of the deceased, for our first responders and for the Hartland community,"" Misko said.

The incident remains under investigation by Hartland police with assistance from the Waukesha County Medical Examiner's Office, the state fire marshal and the Wisconsin Department of Justice's Division of Criminal Investigation.

Hartland is a village of approximately 9,100 people about 26 miles west of Milwaukee.",Q4
https://www.voice-online.co.uk/news/uk-news/2022/11/24/deconstructing-karen-explosive-new-film-tackles-racism-head-on/,Deconstructing Karen: Explosive new film tackles racism head on,"AN EXPLOSIVE new film called Deconstructing Karen aims to get white women to acknowledge their own racism.

The hard-hitting documentary which see’s two women – one black and one Asian – have radically honest conversations with white women about their views on race, inequality and white supremacy – around the dinner table.

The film, which is released in the United Kingdom today on iTunes, is the brainchild of activists Regina Jackson and Saira Rao, who are the co-founders of Race 2 Dinner, a platform that hosts dinners with white women to explain how they could be complicit in oppressing black communities.

Speaking to The Voice, Ms Rao said: “We sit down with them and we help them to acknowledge their own racism and get them on the path to dismantle it.

“White people’s feelings have traditionally trumped black and brown pain, and it has to stop.”

The women, first got the idea after being invited to numerous dinners by white women who wanted to constantly proclaim that they hold no discriminatory thoughts towards black communities.

In 2018, Ms Rao ran for Congress in Denver, and Ms Jackson worked on her campaign and her platform was about discussing the importance of anti-racism work.

However, the pair say they were consistently bombarded by white women inviting them to dinners only to hear the women proclaim that they were not racist.

DANGEROUS: Amy Cooper called the police on a black birdwatcher in New York who pointed out her dog should be on a lead in a nature reserve

Ms Jackson said: “They would want to go to breakfast, lunch, dinner and cocktails with Saira to say ‘not me, I’m not racist’.”

Initially, Ms Rao dismissed the idea of attending, but decided to go, on one condition that Ms Jackson also attended and hosted the dinners with her.

The women hosted the first Race 2 Dinner sit down in January 2019, and say the reactions by some of white women when questioned about their thoughts on race was met with hostility and denial.

Ms Rao said: “So we did it and it went fully sideways. Full white lady Broadway musical, crying, arms folded, eyes rolling.

“We posted about it on Facebook the next day and it went fully viral.”

Ms Jackson told The Voice, she is well aware of a societal hierarchy where black women are at the bottom and “everyone thinks they are better than us.”

But is adamant it is time for this to be recognised so that something can be done about it.

“Let’s unlearn it, but you can’t unlearn it unless you acknowledge it,” she added.

Within Deconstructing Karen, the series of questions and exercises around the dinner table uncover some uncomfortable truths but it allows white women to admit there is a problem, which both Ms Jackson and Ms Rao say subsequently leads to “them doing the work to get well.”

FILM: Deconstructing Karen is out today

The unconventional idea, attracted the attention of film director Patty Ivins Specht who instantly loved the concept and decided to make the film with the women.

Clips of the film went viral on social media and amassed millions of views and shared by celebrities and influencers, like actress Amanda Seales.

The women want Deconstructing Karen to be an eye-opening watch for everyone, to learn and unlearn, so that the next generation do not have to suffer from the long-lasting impact of white supremacy.

Ms Jackson said: “Black people should watch it because you will be affirmed. You won’t feel ghosted, you won’t feel like you are crazy.

“You will feel affirmed, you will feel acknowledged and you will feel seen.”

She added: “Black people use your voice, white people use your voice, indigenous people use your voice, Latino, Hispanic, Asian, use your voice to call out white nonsense when you see it and hear it.”

Ms Rao wants the film to “serve as a guide” for white people about how to talk about racism and other serious issues in a proactive and appropriate manner.”

Both Ms Jackson and Ms Rao have a long history of anti-racism work and believe the only way to stamp it out is to face it head on.

Ms Rao said: “Being nice hasn’t ended racism, holding people’s hands hasn’t ended racism.

“How many black, indigenous, Asian, Latino folks are getting murdered?”

“In the US, it’s a mass murder every other day,” she added.

For Ms Jackson, she wants black communities to start calling out racism for what it is and not dress it up in polite terms like “micro aggressions” and “unconscious bias.”

She said: “We don’t talk about micro aggressions, there’s nothing micro about it, it’s racial aggression.”

“Those are all words to make white people comfortable and we are not doing that anymore,” she added.

Ms Rao who is of South Asian heritage, said what is key about the film and their wider work, is that Ms Jackson is a black woman and they are joining forces to tackle white supremacy and anti-blackness together.

PROTEST: Summer 2020 saw the biggest global protest against racism and police brutality

She said: “A big part of this work is Regina being a black woman, and myself being Asian, non-black person of colour.

“We’re together saying we’re not going to be divided and conquered, we’re not doing that anymore.”

“They try to turn us against each other but it is also very important and its absolutely important in the UK for Asians and south Asians to acknowledge so we can also start dismantling our internalised anti-blackness, our Islamophobia, our casteism and colourism.”

She added: “For me to say white people need to get right, Asians also need to get right, we all need to get right.”

Together, the women have held hundreds of dinners, with white women from the US, Canada and the UK, and they continued to do virtual events during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ms Rao added: “Plenty of white people want to do this work and they want to get well.”

The co-founders say they have experienced some extreme reactions from some of the white women who have attended.

Ms Jackson says one interaction that stands out for her, is where one woman kept insisting she wasn’t racist but continued using “the N word” during the dinner.

For Ms Rao, she recalls almost being physically assaulted by a white woman after challenging her about the origins of yoga.

“A white lady tried to reach over and grab me by my jacket because I said that white people’s yoga in the western world is cultural appropriation,” she explained.

“They have never been challenged before.”

The women believe the hard-hitting straight forward approach is working and now hundreds of white women are coming forward to book them for the radical dinners to “get well”.

Additionally, Ms Rao wants the film to help families dismiss the idea that the dinner table is not a place to discuss race, politics and serious world issues, especially as we approach the festive season.

She said: “If you can make your dinner table a safe space to talk about all of this stuff it ends because if you start talking about it you have to make changes.”

The women are also authors of a new book called White Women: Everything you already know about your own racism and how to do better.

BESTSELLER: Regina Jackson and Saira Rao’s new book

The book has been very well-received and earlier this month hit the New York Times Best seller list in its first week.

Ms Jackson told The Voice, readers who are women of colour readers are “loving” the book because they are “being seen, affirmed and they are being acknowledged.”

The murder of George Floyd in May 2020, sparked global protests against police brutality, racism and racial profiling and saw the rise in the Black Lives Matter movement.

However, both Ms Rao and Ms Jackson believe a lot of the activism that followed was “performative” and not much has changed in the US for black and brown communities.

Ms Jackson said: “It was all performative, which white people are really good at.”

Ms Rao said she thinks things are worst now and there has been a major pushback in the fight for racial equality.

She said: “This is what the attack of woke culture and the attack against critical race theory is about, it is because of the summer of 2020.

“It is a full war against black, indigenous, brown people in this country and against white people who are actually doing the work – they are coming for everybody.”

Ms Jackson told The Voice, that fatal police shootings involving black people are sadly still a regular occurrence in the US.

She said: “There is not a week that goes by in America where a black person is not shot and killed by the police.

“We just had a boy, 15 years old walking on the highway, they arrested him, they put him in jail and the next day he was dead.

“Police are never held accountable, except for maybe George Floyd.

“They just murder with impunity.”

The deepening political divide in America hasn’t gone unnoticed with the co-founders and authors.

Ms Rao said: “What we are seeing is a ton of people are going to the dark side, openly becoming Make America Great Again (MAGA) Republicans.

“Another ton of white folks are becoming silent, even though historically silence has never saved anyone.

“Now what we are seeing is a ton of white folks who do have a sense of history and realise, silence will not save me, silence not save my children and silence will not save humanity.

“They are coming humbly, with open hearts and open minds.”

Ms Jackson also works within schools in the US and says many are now working with other educators who are “going through their programmes” to ensure they can overcome “white supremacy and being committed to humanity for everybody.”

Ms Rao also describes herself as “a work in progress” and says she is “still unlearning” and the work is also for herself.

She added: “This work is for me every day and for my children, the future generation and humanity.”

The use of the word Karen to describe dangerous acts of white privilege displayed by some white women, has become a popular term for black communities in the US.

For example, when a white woman called Amy Cooper called the police on a black man in Central Park who asked her to put her dog on a leash in 2020, the phrase “Karen” exploded across Black Twitter and social media.

In recent months, the name Karen has been attributed to white women threatening to call the police on black people doing everyday things, like shopping, driving, taking out the garbage or returning home from work.

The popularisation of the word and the negative connotations now associated with it, is believed to have impacted the number of new babies being called Karen.

According to official US between 1951 and 1968, the name “Karen” was extremely popular and was in the top 10 most popular baby names.

But fast forward to 2018, Karen is now ranked at the 635th in most popular names.

This year the name Karen has topped the list of the most-Googled slang terms in nearly half of all American states, according to AI writing tool QuillBot.

https://kvia.com/news/2022/11/03/prosecution-reveals-new-timeline-in-murdaugh-killings/,Prosecution reveals new timeline in Murdaugh killings,"By Martin Savidge and Jade Gordon, CNN

In court documents filed earlier this week, South Carolina prosecutors provided insight into what could be a key issue for the defense in Alex Murdaugh’s murder trial: the time of death of the victims.

Alex Murdaugh is charged with the murders of his wife, Maggie Murdaugh, 52, and their 22-year-old son, Paul Murdaugh, whose bodies were discovered on the family property in rural Colleton County on June 7, 2021.

Prosecutors noted the mother and son were killed between 8:30 p.m. and 10:06 p.m. Previously, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division had reported the deaths occurred between 9 p.m. and 9:30 p.m.

Murdaugh, who has pleaded not guilty to the murder charges, said he found the bodies and reported the grim discovery in an emotional 911 call from the same property at 10:07 p.m., according to police records.

The court filing did not explain the new timeline. CNN has reached out to Murdaugh’s attorneys for comment.

In an August hearing, it was revealed that video and audio obtained from Paul Murdaugh’s phone captured a conversation between Alex Murdaugh and his wife and son that took place at Moselle, the property where Maggie and Paul Murdaugh’s bodies were found. That would place Alex Murdaugh at the property and the crime scene at the time of the recording, which was at 8:44 p.m.

Prosecutors said at a hearing last week that Alex Murdaugh fired up his car and left the property at 9:06 p.m. for Alameda, where his father lived. The 911 call at 10:07 p.m. was made from the Moselle property, police records show.

LOUIS — A judge on Friday did not sanction St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly M. Gardner after she was accused by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt of withholding key evidence in a wrongful conviction case.

Gardner’s office has argued for months that Lamar Johnson was the victim of prosecutorial and police misconduct when he was convicted of first-degree murder 30 years ago. Schmitt’s office has worked to uphold his conviction.

St. Louis Circuit Judge David C. Mason is set to hear arguments next week about Johnson’s guilt.

On Thursday, Schmitt filed a motion arguing Gardner should be sanctioned because her office failed to hand over a report about gunshot residue found on a jacket owned by Johnson.

Gardner’s office shot back, calling the jacket a “red herring” that wasn’t even used during the crime.

“The attorney general’s motion is a misleading and disappointing effort to distract the court and the public from Lamar Johnson’s innocence,” a lawyer for Gardner’s office wrote in a filing.

Late Friday afternoon, Mason ruled the jacket could be introduced as evidence in next week’s hearing as long as attorneys could show that Johnson wore the jacket at the time of the crime. He did not sanction Gardner.

The hearing about Johnson’s conviction is set to begin Monday in St. Louis court.",Q4

https://abovethelaw.com/2022/10/fake-lawyer-gives-fake-lawyers-a-bad-name/,Fake Lawyer Gives Fake Lawyers A Bad Name,"The State Bar of California, in conjunction with the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office and the National Insurance Crime Bureau, announced the seizure of Peter Shah’s law practice. Or maybe it’s better to say law practices? Well, it’s definitely better to use quotation marks around “law.”

Because Peter Shah, aka Peter Sharokhi, aka Pedram Sharokhi, is not actually a lawyer. But that didn’t stop him from allegedly running “more than a dozen” phony legal practices to scam clients.

In one instance, Shah allegedly hired an attorney to work with him who believed Shah was a lawyer, only to steal the attorney’s identity to illegally practice law. In another case, bar officials said Shah secured a $25,000 personal injury settlement for a client who believed he was a legitimate lawyer and never told the man. According to Hernandez, Shah was expelled from law school and never received his J.D. The number of his victims is unknown, he said.

If only he could have finished law school and learned how to scam people the legal way!

On a serious note, folks always need to keep stories like these in perspective. Tales of unlicensed scammers get easily wrapped into anti-reform narratives by cynical establishment types. “The public must be protected from con artists pretending to be lawyers… that’s why we have a bar exam!” That doesn’t make any sense. Licensing regimes don’t necessitate closed-book generalist doctrinal exams. And, not for nothing, but actual lawyers ripping off clients far exceeds the number of imposter attorneys ripping off clients.

Likewise, these are the stories that get deployed to undermine efforts to expand the population of legal service providers. “We can’t have paralegal professionals offering lower cost, limited legal services… think of the risk of fraud!” No. Opening up avenues for non-lawyer providers to address discrete legal needs isn’t what’s endangering the public.

At last week’s RelativityFest, I sat in on a panel moderated by Relativity’s David Horrigan where he asked the panelists about the wisdom of expanding the practice of law — similar to what we’ve seen in Utah and Arizona (and Washington in the past). While the journalists on the panel, such as our columnist Bob Ambrogi, saw these reforms as critical to addressing access to justice, other lawyers expressed reservations about allowing unsupervised non-lawyer practitioners.

But it’s not like a law license magically transforms someone into a professional. These non-lawyer providers may colloquially be “fake” lawyers but they’re licensed, they’re skilled, and they’re bound by ethical rules. They don’t deserve to be lumped together with some yahoo with a scam legal practice.

Appreciate the story on its own merits, but don’t allow anyone to bolt it onto a narrative that everyone outside the lawyer caste is a shady actor.

Because that’s a scam in its own right.

https://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/the-learning-club-internship-invests-in-local-talent-to-grow-future-kckps-teachers,'The Learning Club' internship invests in local talent to grow future KCKPS teachers,"KANSAS CITY, Kan. — A Kansas City, Kansas, nonprofit is investing in growing its own public school teachers.

The Learning Club hires high school interns from KCKPS for an after-school tutoring program and equips them to pursue a degree in education.

The hope is, they will come back to their school districts and and teach in the schools.

Javen Betts was one of the first teaching interns at The Learning Club five-years-ago.

He is now finishing his senior year at the University of Kansas and plans to come back to KCK and teach fourth grade.

Betts says there is value in investing in local talent and growing the community’s own teachers. By coming back, he is hoping to give back to his neighborhood that once poured into him.

“Growing your own is super vital, and it’s super vital for the longevity of, you know, the wealth of the community,” Betts said. “It’s something that you were a product of, and so it should be something you are proud of.""

Betts believes the talent and resources to teach are in KCK — it is the passion that he wants to bring back.

“The program is amazing in, you know, creating educators that are passionate about what they do,"" he said. ""So when you talk about, you know, getting them in and then seeing them all the way through the process, and then in the classroom making an impact, it’s really just the return of investment that the program gave to the community.""

Raymond Taddeo, the internship director at The Learning Club, says many of his interns walk through his doors wanting to be a solution to the problems they saw growing up. He says this program gives them an avenue to do that.

“Students nowadays are so much more aware of social inequities and problems in society and I think a lot of kids want to be a part of solutions, but they don’t know how to be a part of solutions,” he said.

Taddeo believes the program is also a viable, long-term way to combat the on-going nationwide teacher shortage and retention.

“This is an idea of a solution thats less of a bandaid and is more of like a solution that can be longterm,” he said.

Amarian Holliday is one of the newest interns. She says she has been affected by the teacher shortage first-hand, and knowing she would be helping her community, is all she needs to know to answer the call.

“I’ve always noticed teachers leaving or having a long-term sub, and I think it’s really important that students have one teacher throughout the whole year,” Holliday said. “Just give to the people who helped me and like taught me and raised me.”

The Learning Club Teaching Internship runs alongside KCKPS’ regular school year. Applications for the 2023 season will open in May.

Interested students must submit an application complete with a teacher recommendation and essay. Preference goes to students wanting to pursue a career in education.

Deaf West Theatre has partnered with the Utah Schools for the Deaf and Blind (USDB) for the third annual National Deaf High School Theatre Festival (NDHSTF), a hybrid-virtual and in-person educational theatrical competition for young Deaf actors across the United States.

The in-person festival will be held March 16-19, 2023 in Salt Lake City, with the final community performance to be live-streamed to a national audience on Stellar. The virtual festival will be held January 30-March 10, 2023. The deadline to register for both is January 20, 2023.

The NDHSTF gives young Deaf performers the ability to perform on a national stage, refine their skills through competition and feedback, use American Sign Language (ASL) as their medium for acting, experience professional theater in an accessible language, and socialize with like-minded Deaf peers.

Teaching Artists for the 2023 festival will include renowned artists from the Deaf community including Jonaz McMillan, who also serves as this year's Festival Programmer and Coordinator, as well as Storm Smith, Renca Dunn, and Sunshine 2.0 from the National Technical Institute for the Deaf.

https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2022/11/08/692371/US-Trump-Pelosi-Animal,Trump vows to end Pelosi’s career as he drops hint about 2024 White House run,"Former US President Donald Trump has vowed to end the political career of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, calling the top Democrat an “animal” for impeaching him twice, as he made his strongest hint yet that he may launch a third run for the White House after the midterm elections.

Trump, who was appearing at a rally near Dayton, Ohio on Monday in support of Republican Senate candidate JD Vance, lashed out at Pelosi less than two weeks after the Democratic Speaker’s husband, Paul Pelosi, was assaulted by an assailant with a hammer at the couple’s San Francisco home.

Trump's disparaging remarks about Pelosi were made on the eve of the decisive midterm elections on Tuesday.

He used the rally to declare that he would be “making a very big announcement” about his future at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on November 15.

Trump made the comment about Pelosi immediately after mentioning an MS-13 gang member convicted of murder, to whom he referred the same way: “This was an animal.”

""I think she’s an animal, too, to tell you the truth,” Trump said at the rally.

He also referred to Pelosi as “crazy Nancy Pelosi,” as he repeatedly has before in disparaging remarks targeting the Speaker who led the House as it impeached Trump twice during his tenure in office.

“We are going to end crazy Nancy Pelosi’s political career once and for all!” he said as his supporters cheered.

In the meantime, the brutal attack against Pelosi, which authorities have described as politically-motivated, has raised concerns, especially among Democrats, about political violence and Republican rhetoric.

Republicans warn of major battle with Democrats if Trump indicted

In the aggravated assault, which was carried out after breaking and entering in the early morning hours of Oct. 28, the 82-year-old Pelosi suffered blunt force trauma to his head and body.

Last week, San Francisco's District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said the attack on Pelosi was ""politically motivated.""

David DePape, the man accused of attacking Pelosi, is a San Fransico-based Canadian with alt-right ideology who published multiple blogs in which he posted bigoted commentary directed at people of color, women, Muslims, Jews, members of the LGBTQ community and immigrants.

This comes as 9 of 10 Americans fear political violence as midterms near, resonating the political crisis surrounding the 2020 US presidential election.

A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll showed that 88 percent were concerned the political divisions had intensified to a degree that there was an increased risk of politically-motivated violence in the US.

On Wednesday, Biden pleaded with the people of America to accept election results and avoid resorting to violence.

“We must, with one overwhelming unified voice, speak as a country and say there’s no place, no place for voter intimidation or political violence in America, whether it’s directed at Democrats or Republicans,” Biden said. “No place, period. No place, ever.”",Q4

DALLAS — In 2016, William Reece led authorities to a 7,000-yard strip of land along Texas Highway 288 in Brazoria County, about 25 miles south of Houston.

It was there, he told investigators, they would find the remains of Kelli Ann Cox, a University of North Texas student who vanished in 1997.

Reece was correct. authorities found remains, confirmed them to be those of Cox and Reece was charged with her murder.

Now, Cox's case is among those being featured as part of a new Netflix series, ""Cold Case: The Texas Killing Fields.""

The documentary specifically focuses on a series of murders involving young women and girls who were found dead in the Houston area along Interstate 45.

Four of the killings remain unsolved: Laura Miller, Heidi Fye, Audrey Cook and Donna Prudhomme. The area where their bodies were discovered was dubbed ""The Killing Fields.""

Cox's remains weren't found in that specific area; Brazoria County is just west of there. But her killer, Reece, was responsible for two other murders involving victims found in the South Houston area around the same time.

Cox was 20 and a senior at the University of North Texas when she was last seen in Denton on July 15, 1997.

Her case went cold until 2016, when Reece, who was imprisoned on a separate kidnapping case, led authorities to her remains.

This summer, he pleaded guilty in the case, bringing an end to more than 20 years of seeking justice for Cox's family. He was sentenced to life in prison.

He also pleaded guilty in Galveston County to the murders of 12-year-old Laura Kate Smither, of Friendswood, and 17-year-old Jessica Cain, of Tiki Island.

Those cases had also remained cold until Reece's confession in 2016 when he led investigators to the bodies of Cain and Cox. Laura's body was found a few days after she disappeared in 1997.",Q4

One of the U.S. Capitol Police officers who died by suicide in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol breach has been determined to have died in the line of duty, according to his family and officials.

Howard Liebengood killed himself on Jan. 9, several days after joining the response to the breach, according to the U.S. Capitol Police (USCP).

Family members of Liebengood, 51, asked the Department of Justice to classify the death as in the line of duty, and the department agreed, relatives said in a Nov. 21 statement released through the Fraternal Order of Police, a police union.

“The determination is significant, healing, relieving, and we are grateful for it,” the family said.

The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.

The designation is the first under the reformed Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Program, which was altered by the bipartisan Public Safety Officer Support Act. The bill, sponsored in the House of Representatives by Reps. Guy Reschenthaler (R-Pa.) and David Trone (D-Md.), extended the benefits program to first responders who die by suicide or are left disabled as a result of post-traumatic stress disorder linked to trauma from their job.

“Anyone who knew Howie knew he was kind-hearted and fiercely loyal. We all desperately miss his one-of-a-kind smile and his warm, gentle temperament, but we take some solace in knowing that Howie officially has received this well-deserved honor,” the Liebengood family said.

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who co-sponsored the companion bill in the Senate, welcomed the new development.

“Officer Howie Liebengood was often one of the very first people I saw at the Capitol every day and was well known to my entire staff. It was clear that being a U.S. Capitol Police Officer was more than a job to him—he was a man who dedicated his life to serving others and spent 15 years defending the halls of democracy,” Kaine said in a statement, adding that Liebengood’s death “was a heartbreaking loss for his family and for every American who believes in the promise of our democratic institutions.”

“We have a responsibility to carry with us his spirit of service and to give his family the recognition and unwavering support they deserve. That’s why I urged the Department of Justice to approve Public Safety Officers’ Benefits for his wife Serena. I am gratified she’s getting those much-deserved benefits today,” Kaine said.

Serena Liebengood had written in an op-ed in January, a year after the breach, that her husband was working “nearly around the clock” in the days after the breach and was “sleep-deprived and exhausted.”

“If it had not been for the events of Jan. 6 and the unremitting work schedule on the ensuing days, I believe my husband would still be here,” she said at the time.

Other Reactions Others also celebrated the development, including Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.).

Wexton said she was “very pleased” with the decision and called herself “awed by Serena’s courage in the wake of this tragedy, as an advocate not only for the benefits her family deserves but also in raising awareness of the mental health struggles law enforcement face and fighting the stigma that keeps many from seeking help.”

Patrick Yoes, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, said that the successful claim “is an important step in acknowledging that law enforcement suicides are service-connected and should be seen for what they are—line of duty deaths.”

The USCP also reacted positively to the decision.

“Suicide has become an epidemic in the law enforcement profession,” an agency spokesperson told news outlets in a statement. “We will continue to work with the Liebengood family to address this important issue.”

The USCP had previously described the death as “off-duty.” It said Liebengood started working for the agency in 2005.

Four Suicides Multiple USCP officers died by suicide after Jan. 6, which saw officers clash with protesters and rioters before and after the breach of the Capitol.

Jeffrey Smith, another officer who worked on Jan. 6, died by suicide, according to his family and the Metropolitan Police Department.

Smith’s death was determined to be in the line-of-duty by a Washington board in March

Gunther Hashida, another Washington officer who responded to the breach, killed himself and was found in his home on July 29, the agency previously confirmed to The Epoch Times

Metropolitan Police Officer Kyle DeFreytag was found dead that same month. He died by suicide, according to the agency

USCP officer Brian Sicknick also died after the breach. His cause of death was natural , according to Washington’s chief medical examiner. Officials and news outlets had claimed that the death was a result of injuries suffered on Jan. 6.

Some 64 Metropolitan Police Department officers sustained documented injuries on Jan. 6 and “many more” were actually injured, Chief Robert Contee testified to Congress. About 114 USCP officers said they were injured on that day, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.",Q4

People used to call Adams a tomboy. His mom never liked that, though he's always been adventurous.

At a park in Nashville, he tears into the woods looking for frogs by a stagnant pond and stumbles upon two young deer lying in the tall grass.

He calls over to his mother, Elizabeth.

""The mom went down there,"" he says, pointing to a nearby creek bed.

""I see. I wonder if they're brothers,"" Elizabeth responds, adding, ""or sisters.""

The complexity of gender has dominated life for this family over the past few years. NPR agreed to use only their middle names because they fear harassment. Adams, 14, was assigned female at birth and has already made a social transition with a new wardrobe and name. But now like other trans teens in Tennessee and elsewhere, his impending medical transition faces resistance from political leaders.

""They are coming from a very close-minded and fearful perspective,"" Elizabeth says. ""I mean, I have some fear. But I'm not letting fear take over.""

Transgender kids have found themselves at the center of a ballooning culture war this election season. In several cities and states — from Boston to Seattle — specialized clinics at academic medical centers have been targeted. Doctors have been harassed, despite following the evolving standards of care for trans teens.

Last month, hundreds of conservatives and anti-trans activists gathered outside the Tennessee Capitol for what they billed as ""The Rally to End Child Mutilation."" Over shouts of counter protesters, state lawmakers vowed to ban gender-affirming surgeries in Tennessee, claiming families were rushing into life-altering and irreversible decisions.

Anti-trans activist Matt Walsh of the far-right Daily Wire organized the rally after producing a supposed ""expose"" in September that claimed Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville was ""butchering"" children and that young patients were being pushed into hormone therapy. Walsh has said the campaign against Vanderbilt's clinic is just the start of his national ambition to end gender-affirming care for minors.

Hardly rushing

In reality, the medical process for Adams has been far more methodical and drawn out than critics claim.

Adams came out as trans to his mom a few years ago. As puberty began, he felt like his body was fighting his brain. So Elizabeth began the painstaking process of getting him into Vanderbilt's pediatric transgender care clinic.

It took nearly a year to land an appointment and another year of consultations to arrive at the point where he's on the cusp of starting hormones. He's still waiting on his therapist to sign off — which is required by Vanderbilt's clinic — since the effects are difficult to reverse once a teen starts growing facial hair and his voice deepens.

""Even if it was the process to just say, 'yep, sign me up,' I can't imagine any parent would just jump into it headfirst, no matter how open they may be,"" his mother says.

What Elizabeth is not quite ready to discuss is any kind of surgery. Adams is still on the young side to be eligible for what's known as ""top surgery"" — in his case, removing the breasts he binds to his chest every day.

""I don't want to be close-minded and say 'it's just a phase,' cause I don't think it is,"" she says. ""Surgery just seems drastic to me right now.""

But her son feels like he's in the wrong body and has for several years at this point. It feeds into his depression. He's already confronted some scary times dealing with suicidal thoughts, she says.

""I want to ease that for him. I mean, that's what I would say to a parent who's terrified and who's wanting to shut these clinics down,"" she says. ""It's scary, but in the end, it's going to save your kid.""

A clinic under assault

The onslaught has been so intense that Vanderbilt's clinic even took down its entire web presence for a while. And in response to demands from Republican legislators, Vanderbilt has agreed to pause surgeries.

Sponsor Message

The irony is that in its statement announcing the pause, the medical center finally revealed just how few surgeries occur on minors — roughly five a year, only on patients 16 and older, never on genitals and always with full parental consent.

Vanderbilt has declined repeated requests for interviews, but specialists around the country have experienced similar firestorms.

""It's not just that we were worried about getting nasty phone calls and letters [in Arkansas]. We were worried about losing our license to practice medicine,"" says Dr. Michele Hutchison, who tried to fend off a ban on pediatric transgender care in Arkansas last year. ""That's a big deal.""

The ban is now held up in court. But Hutchison has since taken a job in a state more friendly to transgender care for minors. She's the chief of pediatric endocrinology at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center.

Hutchison says her biggest concern, though, is for patients who might harm themselves or attempt hormone therapy without medical supervision by using drugs on the black market.

A 2019 study from Canada shows trans teens are five times more likely to consider suicide than their peers. In Tennessee, opponents of trans care for minors have openly cast doubt on these statistics as they call for clinics like Vanderbilt's to shut down.

The health and safety of teens is also the main worry for parents like Elizabeth since Tennessee lawmakers are vowing to ban gender-affirming surgeries for minors and may revisit restrictions on hormone therapy similar to other states.

As teenagers tend to be, Adams is ready to get going, even though he acknowledges his brain is still developing, which can make it hard to fully process long-term consequences.

""If I could choose not to be trans, I probably would,"" Adams says. ""Everyone's just like, 'oh, well, why don't you just be a girl again?' I went through that phase before, a couple of years ago. It was the worst year of my life.""",Q4
https://signalscv.com/2022/11/more-overnight-i-5-closures-for-construction-expected/,More overnight I-5 closures for construction expected,"Motorists might want to plan for delays on northbound Interstate 5 Wednesday night and on the southbound side Thursday night due to construction, said Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials. However, rain might postpone the work, said Patrick Chandler, spokesman for Metro.

Metro and the California Department of Transportation are set to intermittently close one direction of I-5 from Highway 14 to Calgrove Boulevard at selected nighttime hours as part of the $679 million I-5 North County Enhancements Project to enhance safety, reduce congestion, improve the flow of truck freight and motorist traffic, and accommodate expected population growth in the Santa Clarita Valley.

Heavy traffic on Tuesday night as a result of similar closures on northbound I-5 caused many motorists to use State Route 14 as a detour. But the National Weather Service is predicting a patchy drizzle on Wednesday night and rain on Thursday night.

“It is possible that the closures that would go between Thursday and Friday might be postponed,” Chandler told The Signal Wednesday afternoon. “They still have the closures set up for Dec. 1 and Dec. 2, but if there’s rain, they won’t work tomorrow.”

If there’s no rain, the northbound I-5 from SR-14 to Calgrove Boulevard will be closed from 10 p.m. on Wednesday to 4 a.m. on Thursday, and the southbound I-5 from Calgrove Boulevard to SR-14 will be closed from 10 p.m. on Thursday to 4 a.m. on Friday.

Chandler expects no postponements for the closures next Monday and Tuesday nights, which will also be from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. on both nights.

Motorist detours for through traffic are as follows:

• Northbound I-5 freeway closures: Exit I-5 to northbound SR-14, continue to westbound Golden Valley Road/Newhall Ranch Road, and proceed to the Newhall Ranch Road I-5 onramp.

• Southbound I-5 freeway closures: Exit I-5 to eastbound Newhall Ranch Road/Golden Valley Road, continue to southbound SR-14 off Golden Valley Road, and proceed to the I-5/SR-14 Interchange.

Project improvements include the addition of a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) or carpool lane in each direction, the extension of the truck lanes, new sound walls and auxiliary lanes, and other improvements in the 14-mile corridor between SR-14 in Santa Clarita and Parker Road in Castaic. Metro expects the project to be completed in 2026.

Chandler said work is moving along and added that even if they don’t work on Thursday due to rain, they should be able to remain on schedule, as these types of setbacks are often worked into contingency plans.

“I was at Weldon Canyon last night where they’re going to demolish the existing bridge that’s there — because we’re widening the freeway and adding HOV lanes — so, I believe that they were near completion or did complete the installation of I beams. But basically, they’re building the structure to build the falsework so that they can pour concrete into those forms to build a new bridge.”

By improving the ability to merge and offering trucks a separate lane from general-purpose lanes, motorists who use the corridor can expect to have a faster, smoother and safer driving experience, according to Metro officials.

The project is funded through a combination of Los Angeles County voter-approved Measures R and M funding specifically set aside for road and highways projects, along with Senate Bill 1 and federal dollars. SB 1 uses state gas taxes and vehicle fees to fund roadways, improve transit and build walking and biking projects.

High-level huddle reviews army's matters.

Top brass vows to fulfil nation's aspirations.

RAWALPINDI: Pakistan Army's top brass Wednesday resolved to uproot terrorism ""without any distinction"" as the country battles a fresh wave of insurgency, which has left many soldiers martyred and several others injured.

The resolve was reiterated at the 254th Corps Commanders Conference (CCC) in Rawalpindi, the first chaired by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir, who took up the charge as the military's head last month.

At the conference, which took place from December 27-28, a comprehensive review of professional and organisational matters of the army was undertaken, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).

""It was resolved to fight against terrorists without any distinction and eliminate this menace as per the aspirations of the people of Pakistan,"" the military's media wing added.

The development comes after several terror attacks took place across Pakistan, with most of them in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, worrying the nation of a rise in terrorism.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also recently reiterated his resolve to uproot the menace of terrorism by using all resources available in Pakistan.

""We are working hard to prevent them. We will employ all resources to uproot terrorism to bring peace in Pakistan,"" the premier added.

Recently, the Islamabad Police came up with a “special security plan"" after a suicide attack left a cop martyred and injured several others.

Security checkpoints have increased across the capital and ""high alert"" has been imposed while citizens have been advised to ensure cooperation with law enforcers.

In light of the high alert, several embassies — including the United States, Saudi Arabia and Australia — warned their citizens not to travel unnecessarily in the federal capital.

On Sunday, as many as nine intermittent blasts hit Balochistan — in Quetta, Khuzdar, and other areas — leaving five soldiers, including a captain, martyred and injuring 15 others on Sunday.

Earlier this month, militants sieged a Counter-Terrorism Department’s (CTD) compound in KP's Bannu area, which was cleared by the Pakistan Army soldiers three days later. However, four soldiers embraced martyrdom and 10 sustained injuries.",Q4

Governor also donates $100,000 from Contingent Account to Lobstermen’s Association to support ongoing legal battles

Today Governor Janet Mills directed the Maine Department of Marine Resources (DMR) to file a motion to expedite the appeal of a recent decision by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in Maine Lobstermen’s Association v. National Marine Fisheries Service.

The Mills Administration has partnered with the Maine Lobstermen’s Association in Maine Lobstermen’s Association v. National Marine Fisheries Service to assert that the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Biological Opinion, released in May 2021, is unlawful. The State and MLA argue that NMFS acted arbitrarily by failing to rely on the best available scientific information and by failing to account for the positive impact of costly conservation measures already adopted by the Maine lobster fishery. In its September 8, 2022 opinion, the U.S. District Court sided with NMFS against Maine lobstermen.

“As the National Marine Fisheries Services pushes heedlessly ahead to implement new rules that would devastate Maine lobstermen, the Appeals Court must move just as fast to consider the available science and reverse the lower court’s opinion to prevent further damage to this critical industry,” said Governor Mills. “My Administration will continue to fight to see that the courts use sound science and proven facts – most notably that a known right whale mortality has never been attributed to Maine lobster gear and that lobstermen have undertaken substantial measures, at great personal expense, to protect them. My Administration will keep fighting with everything we’ve got to defend the lobster industry and its hard-working men and women.”

In addition to NMFS rulemaking that has already begun, a pending decision in a second lawsuit adds urgency to the need for a decision in the MLA vs NMFS case.

The Mills Administration is also fighting for Maine lobstermen in Center for Biological Diversity v. Ross in the U.S. District Court in the D.C. Circuit to contest the Federal government’s new regulation to protect North Atlantic Right Whales.

“A court decision in the plaintiff’s favor could close Maine’s lobster fishery altogether – a completely unacceptable outcome that would be devastating to our lobstermen and their families and devastating to our coastal communities and our economy,” said Governor Mills. “We will fight tooth and nail to prevent that from happening.”

With the approval of the Office of Attorney General and $3 million approved by the State Legislature in her biennial budget, the Mills Administration has contracted with specialized outside counsel with extensive experience litigating Endangered Species Act issues related to commercial fishing to represent the State of Maine in this lawsuit. Contracting with this expert law firm, as opposed to using the Office of the Attorney General, puts the State and Maine lobstermen in a stronger position to fight the case.

Additionally, to further support Maine lobstermen, Governor Mills announced today she is dedicating $100,000 from the Governor’s Contingency Fund to the Maine Lobstermen’s Association’s legal defense fund to support the legal efforts.",Q4

A man has sustained serious injuries in a 'brutal' shark attack in Hawaii on Tuesday, police have said.

A 68-year-old man was swimming about 400 yards offshore at Anaehoomalu Bay, in Waikoloa at around 8am when he was attacked by a shark, according to a news release from Hawaii Police Department.

‌



Officials said the man was bitten on the lower left torso by the shark in the horrifying attack.

Hawaii police have since asked locals to get in touch if they have any information about the shark attack.

The incident is the second shark attack to have happened in Hawaii recently.

Last week a woman went missing and is feared dead after she and her husband reportedly got into a fight with a shark while snorkelling off the Hawaiian island of Maui.

James Charles Lees is accused of negligence and wrongful conduct that resulted in the death of Timothy Wayne St. John, 20, North Brook, Illinois, according to the complaint filed by Jeffrey and Julie St. John on Monday, Nov. 7. The lawsuit states Jeffrey and Julie St. John are demanding a jury trial and damages of $150,000 or more.

Timothy St. John was riding a Canyon road bicycle southbound on N.D. Highway 20 near mile marker 10.5 shortly after 12:30 p.m. June 19, while Lees was driving a 2016 Chevrolet Silverado southbound on Highway 20. Lees failed to yield to the bicycle and struck the rear tire, pushing the bicycle and rider into the west ditch, the North Dakota Highway Patrol said in news release about the accident in June.

The patrol said Lees left the scene but returned and located the cyclist. The cyclist was declared dead at the scene after emergency personnel arrived.

No citations were issued by the patrol.

The lawsuit says Lees’ negligence resulted in the death of Timothy St. John and caused Jeffrey and Julie St. John to sustain serious noneconomic damages and losses including but not limited to past and future mental anguish, emotional distress, grief, sorrow, loss of society, loss of comfort and past and future loss of companionship. The lawsuit says Lees’ negligence caused Jeffrey and Julie St. John to sustain serious economic damages including medical expenses for the care and treatment of their son and funeral and burial costs.

Weiss took issue with Musk's decision on Thursday to ban several journalists from Twitter, accusing them of 'doxxing' him.

The former world's richest man took issue with the journalists from CNN, The Washington Post, New York Times and other outlets reporting on his decision to block an account that tracked his private jet as it flew around the world. Musk said it was a dangerous violation of his privacy.

The journalists blocked by Musk pointed out they never revealed his address or personal information, and said Musk was being hypocritical by banning reporting on him, while promising transparency.

Weiss on Friday morning sided with the journalists, and called on Musk to reverse his decision.

Bari Weiss (left) on Friday found herself in a heated debate with her powerful backer Elon Musk (right)

'The old regime at Twitter governed by its own whims and biases and it sure looks like the new regime has the same problem. I oppose it in both cases,' she tweeted.

'And I think those journalists who were reporting on a story of public importance should be reinstated.

'I have never been swayed by the 'Twitter is a private company' argument. And I'm left wondering, as I wrote yesterday @TheFP, whether any unelected individual or clique should have this kind of power over the public conversation.'

She added, however, that journalists who praised Twitter's decision to block previous users such as Donald Trump, Kanye West and Alex Jones were now complaining of censorship.

'I don't need to dwell on how mesmerizing it is to watch those journalists who defended—even celebrated!—Twitter's bans under the old regime under the guise of 'safety' now call it censorship, and say it infringes on freedom of expression,' she continued.

'It did then as it does now.'

Musk - who handpicked Weiss to report on the internal workings of the company he bought - wasted no time in replying, hitting back in less than half an hour.

Elon Musk, 51, has vowed that 'everything we find will be released' as Twitter continues to release the files surrounding censorship on the social media platform he now owns. On Friday he found himself in an angry argument with Bari Weiss, to whom he handed the documents

'What should the consequence of doxxing someone's real-time, exact location be? Assume your child is at that location, as mine was,' he tweeted.

An hour later, with no response, he tweeted at 1:36pm: 'Bari, this is a real question, not rhetorical. What is your opinion?'

Weiss on Friday challenged her powerful backer, causing him to accuse her of 'virtue-signaling to show that you are 'good' in the eyes of media elite to keep one foot in both worlds'

Still receiving no reply from Weiss, at 3:34pm he continued: 'Rather than rigorously pursuing truth, you are virtue-signaling to show that you are 'good' in the eyes of media elite to keep one foot in both worlds.'

Weiss took her time to reply, responding to Musk four hours later, at 7:22pm, and attempting to assuage her powerful backer.

'If someone messed with my baby or my family I'm sure I'd change the rules and ban the jet account, too,' she said diplomatically.

'But last month you said you were leaving it up to show your commitment to free speech. So doesn't it make sense that people would be confused?

'Given the mixed messaging, I would have given more notice on the new rule before punishing anyone for a violation. And if they violated it again? Totally fair game to take action against those accounts. But I think people object to the lack of clear process and communication.'

Weiss admitted it was complicated.

'I don't envy any of these decisions,' she concluded.

'But the problem with Old Twitter was that the rules were vague, unevenly applied, and often backfilled to suit the political prejudices of mgmt. New Twitter has an opportunity to be different: open, transparent and above the partisan fray.'",Q4

How would you like to explore a giant neutrino detector in 3D from the comfort of your mobile phone? VENu is a new smartphone app that allows you explore the physics underlying the MicroBooNE neutrino detector at Fermilab. Developed by Alistair McLean of New Mexico State University and an international team of physicists, the app is used in conjunction with the Google Cardboard headset to provide users with a virtual-reality experience of MicroBooNE. VENu includes games that offer “brain teasing challenges” including working out how to spot a neutrino event in a busy background of cosmic-ray events. The app can be downloaded free of charge from the Apple Store and the Google Android Marketplace.

Hamilton is the hottest ticket in the West End these days so imagine my surprise when I discovered that it is about Alexander Hamilton the American revolutionary – not the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton. This shocker came courtesy of Nicole Yunger Halpern, who has written an entertaining piece on the Quantum Frontiers blog about why there should be a musical about the father of the Hamiltonian operator. Mathematician Hamilton was born a year after the death of his American namesake and his work on mechanics still inspires the quantum physics of today. My only quibble is with Halpern’s suggested title for the Broadway show Hamiltonian: an American Musical. Hamilton was born in Dublin and spent most of his life in Ireland, so Hamiltonian: an Irish Musical seems much more appropriate.

Should scientists march on Washington to protest the science policies (or lack thereof) of the new US president? No, argues the geologist Robert Young in an opinion piece in the New York Times. In “A scientists’ march on Washington is a bad idea” Young writes that a demonstration “will serve only to reinforce the narrative from sceptical conservatives that scientists are an interest group and politicise their data, research and findings for their own ends”. Young speaks from bitter personal experience. In 2010 he was co-author of a report that used peer-reviewed research to conclude that the sea level along the North Carolina coastline could rise by nearly 1 m by 2100 due to climate change. Young and his colleagues were vilified in the press and North Carolina passed laws that “barred state and local agencies from developing regulations or planning documents anticipating a rise in sea level”.

Young sympathizes with members of the public who accepted the negative reaction because he believes that few people have an understanding of how science is done. So instead of marching, Young wants his scientist colleagues to engage with their neighbours. “Make contact with that part of America that doesn’t know any scientists. Put a face on the debate. Help them understand what we do, and how we do it.”",Q4

Wade has changed the landscape of 2022 elections,"The overturn of Roe v. Wade has been unpopular with most Americans. Fifty-seven percent of adults have indicated disapproval of the Supreme Court ruling, according to Pew Research. (Credit: Brianne Ledda)

With midterm elections less than a month away, the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade has spurred a wave of political energy that casts doubt on the certainty of Republican victories this fall.

The landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision affirming the right to an abortion was overturned in June, sending shock waves throughout the country, including the East End, where — although abortions remain legal in New York State — hundreds have turned out at protests since the decision.

Most recently, nearly 200 people turned out last week for a women’s march in Greenport. Many cited the overturning of Roe v. Wade as a catalyst for concern about the upcoming midterms in November.

On July 4 this year on Shelter Island, a crowd of about 200, mostly women, but with men and children in the ranks, assembled at Volunteer Park on Bridge Street to protest the Supreme Court decision. A few days earlier, a protest march took place in the Center.

The assembly was peaceful, with many carrying signs as they crossed Bridge Street, then walked single file up Chase Avenue to the Heights Post Office, looping back down to converge at the park again.

Her husband, David Hoffman, added: “I have a daughter. And I don’t want her to live in a world where she is disrespected by her government.”

Democratic state Senate 1st District candidate Skyler Johnson highlighted the importance of turning out to vote in November, eliciting cheers from the Greenport crowd, because “we have seen what happens when we let extremists take power.”

“We have Nick LaLota running for Congress, who has not supported exceptions for abortion for rape, incest or even the life of the mother. Are we going to let them win? There is no other choice,” Mr. Johnson continued. “We are going to protect fundamental rights in the state of New York.”

Mr. LaLota is running against Legislator Bridget Fleming, the former Southampton councilwoman who has made protecting women’s reproductive rights a focus of her campaign. She has positioned herself as a candidate who will fight to federally codify the protections of Roe v. Wade.

Mr. LaLota’s campaign website, under a section titled “Protecting Life,” said the Supreme Court decision was a “step in the right direction” and added the state Legislature should repeal the “extreme provision which allows for third trimester abortions.”

The campaign page was later updated with a new section titled “Pro-Life vs. Pro-Choice,” in which Mr. LaLota softens his stance by saying he does not oppose abortion “in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother’s life.”

He focuses his opposition to abortion in the second and third trimesters. Current New York law allows a woman to get an abortion up to and including 24 weeks of pregnancy (the second trimester) and exceptions are allowed after 24 weeks if the woman’s health or pregnancy is at risk.

“Abortion is a personal and divisive topic but I will lead the charge to find common ground — and that is eliminating second and third trimester abortions,” Mr. LaLota says on his campaign site.

In June, Congressman Lee Zeldin (R-Shirley), who is challenging incumbent Democrat Kathy Hochul for New York governor, called the Supreme Court’s decision a “victory for life, for family, for the Constitution and for federalism.” Ms. Hochul’s campaign has focused heavily on reproductive rights. On Sept. 28, she posted on Twitter that Mr. Zeldin had told an anti-abortion group he would ban abortion without exceptions.

“I refuse to let him roll back our reproductive rights,” she wrote.

Mr. Zeldin’s campaign has focused largely on crime and has mostly shied away from the abortion issue.

Historically, the party that doesn’t control the White House picks up seats in the House of Representatives during midterm elections.

According to the website FiveThirtyEight, as of Oct. 10, Republicans have a 7-in-10 chance of claiming a majority in the House, where Democrats currently hold a slim 222-to-213 edge. Democrats have a 2-in-3 chance of holding on to the U.S. Senate.

“Given that the Democrats have a very small majority in the House, it’s still quite likely that there will be a Republican majority in the House after the November elections. How big that Republican majority will be is unclear. I think it’s possible that the Democrats could hold onto a bare majority in the House, but it seems unlikely,” said Stanley Feldman, a political science professor and associate director of the Center for Survey Research at Stony Brook University.

“The Senate is much more difficult to know,” Mr. Feldman added. “There probably are going to be a number of close races. There are some possibilities where Republicans could in fact pick up a seat or two that they need. But there also are states in which the Democrats could pick up one or two seats in the Senate. So I think that the forecast for the Senate is very unclear at this point.”

The overturning of Roe v. Wade has been unpopular with most Americans. According to Pew research, 57% of adults indicated disapproval of the Supreme Court ruling, with 41% indicating approval. Public support for legal abortion, as of July, remained at 62%. That support is even higher in younger demographics — seven in 10 adults ages 18 to 29 say abortion should be legal in all or most cases.

Young people often sit out midterm elections, experts say, but many political analysts have predicted the Supreme Court’s June ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization will motivate young voters, especially women, to participate in higher numbers.

The FiveThirtyEight website reported last week that abortion restrictions “could end up being a generation-defining event, even if young women don’t dramatically reshape the outcome of the midterms … The Supreme Court’s decision and the bans that followed are likely to shape young women’s views of the GOP for years to come, solidifying their antipathy to the party as they grow older and start voting more regularly.”

In August, Democrat Pat Ryan beat Republican Marc Molinaro in New York’s 19th District in a House special election. Mr. Ryan centered his campaign on abortion rights in the district, which carried former President Donald Trump in 2016 and President Joe Biden in 2020. Political news outlet The Hill called his victory a “canary in the coal mine.”

Polling data aggregator RealClearPolitics has indicated a drop in public support for Republicans in the upcoming congressional vote since Dobbs as well, with the party leading by just 0.9 points as of Oct. 8. On May 1, the day before the draft decision overturning Roe v. Wade was leaked, Republicans led by 4.2 points.

Activists have highlighted the Dobbs decision as the first time in history the Supreme Court has rolled back rights, and many have expressed concern about the vulnerability of other rights, such as the right to same-sex marriage.

Harvard public policy professor Maya Sen pointed out, in an interview posted to the university’s website, that the decision will also likely lead to “increased calls by the Democratic party and progressive activists for reforming the court — including increased calls for restricting the court’s jurisdiction, instituting term limits for the justices, or expanding the court’s size.”

The Supreme Court striking down Roe v. Wade, she added, “puts the onus on politicians in blue states to try to protect [the] reproductive rights of their own residents and also to make it easier for pregnant people traveling out of red states seeking abortions.”

Mr. Feldman said, while abortion access in New York is “probably safe,” thanks to Democratic support in the State Legislature, it’s still not guaranteed under the state constitution.

“I think in the short term, New Yorkers don’t need to be concerned about restrictions,” he said. “On the other hand, should sometime in the future there be Republican control of the Legislature or a Republican governor, I think that’s a little less clear.”

Mr. Feldman pointed out that the state Legislature has passed a bill to incorporate abortion access in the state constitution. To amend the constitution, a bill needs to be passed in two legislative sessions and then put to a statewide vote, so it will be at least 2024 before an abortion amendment can be put to a vote in New York.

“If that effort succeeds, it will be extremely difficult to roll back abortion protections even if Democrats were to lose control of the Legislature,” he said.",Q4

The New York Post reports that the sting was linked to fentanyl and occurred “at an apartment on Vermilyea Ave near Academy Street in Inwood.”

The sting included federal personnel as well–agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration–and was an attempt to arrest two men, at least one of whom shot at law enforcement personnel.

Law enforcement returned fire, wounding one of the two men.

The wounded man “barricaded himself inside the apartment” for a time then died inside the apartment. The second suspect was taken into custody.

CBS New York quoted NYPD Chief of Patrol Jeffrey Maddrey saying, “As the members of the task force tried to make the apprehension, at least one of the males pulled the gun on them and fired at them. Members of the task force were able to apprehend one male right away.”

Police found two guns inside the apartment.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2384485/social-media-regulations,Social media regulations,"Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah has recently indicated plans to introduce regulations to ‘control’ some social media elements that harm people’s privacy. This will not be the first time a Pakistani government has tried to regulate social media activity. Pakistan has had a long history of internet and social media blocks with app bans lasting for years — something that has reflected poorly on the country’s ability to allow freedom of speech. The government’s decision to introduce a new bill comes after a surge in misinformation and rumours against state institutions, organisations and individuals during the last few months. Earlier, the federal government approved an amendment to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Act empowering it with a section of the Pakistan Penal Code to act against anyone who intends to spread rumours or false information against state institutions on social media.

The government reassured that it would consult organisations representing media-persons about FIA’s social media laws and will withdraw the bill if it restricts freedom of expression. Given the fast-paced nature of social media, it is almost impossible to control the dissemination of information without a severe crackdown. These laws blur lines between different forms of content significantly curbing users’ activity and alienating the public. The new amendment will allow the FIA to take unilateral action without needing a court permit or warrant, which may set a dangerous precedent.

Instead of simply consulting media bodies and other stakeholders, the federal government should include them in the decision-making process to adopt a targeted strategy to root out adverse elements from social media. It is worth mentioning that tightening social media laws and regulations can only limit the flow of information on online platforms allowing wayward elements to continue spreading disinformation through other means. This can raise alarm amongst the public compelling people to act against any individual or community.

Therefore, the federal government must initiate wider discourse on the need to double-check information and the harmful consequences of disseminating incorrect information. Although laws can help control public activity online, the onus lies on the government, the opposition and other stakeholders to remain cautious of their rhetoric on public forums to prevent mischief-makers from propagating false narratives in pursuit of their vested interest and nefarious designs.

https://www.thesundaily.my/world/kevin-spacey-due-in-new-york-court-for-sexual-abuse-of-teen-in-1986-AH9922020,Kevin Spacey due in New York court for sexual abuse of teen in 1986,"NEW YORK: Kevin Spacey will appear in a New York court from Thursday to face a civil lawsuit brought by US actor Anthony Rapp, who has accused the disgraced Hollywood star of sexually abusing him when he was 14.

The two-time Oscar-winning star of the stage, cinema and television -- whose full name is Kevin Spacey Fowler -- has disappeared from public view since he became one of the first performers to be caught up in the freshly minted #MeToo movement in October 2017.

Rapp, who currently stars in the “Star Trek: Discovery” series, turns 51 this month. He filed a complaint in September 2020 against Spacey for advances and an alleged sexual assault at a party in Manhattan in 1986.

Rapp was 14 years old at the time, while Spacey -- now 63 -- was almost twice his age.

Global fame

Spacey, who built his worldwide fame since the 1980s in movies such as “The Usual Suspects” and “American Beauty” and on to the Netflix hit “House of Cards,“ has always denied allegations of sexual abuse.

The #MeToo movement exploded in October 2017, when more than 80 women in the movie industry accused -- and ultimately brought down -- the previously untouchable producer Harvey Weinstein.

At the end of the month, Rapp accused Spacey for the first time, in great detail, in an interview with BuzzFeed News.

The next day, on Twitter, Spacey presented his “sincerest apology” to Rapp for any “deeply inappropriate drunken behavior,“ saying he did not recall the incident.

After a 2020 criminal charge of sexual assault was dismissed by a judge, Rapp filed a civil suit that will see Spacey in a Manhattan courtroom starting Thursday at 9:30 am (1330 GMT), in a case to be heard by a jury and presided over by Judge Lewis Kaplan.

'An impartial jury'

“Mr Spacey will appear Thursday and throughout the trial. We look forward to his vindication by an impartial jury,“ his lawyer Jennifer Keller told AFP in an email.

If found guilty, Spacey faces significant damages.

Kaplan had dropped Rapp's initial charge of sexual assault, ruling it had been brought too late and was not covered by a New York state law on child protection, implemented in 2019.

However, the judge acknowledged that during the party in 1986, Spacey had fondled the 14-year-old boy's buttocks, lifted him onto a bed and laid partially on top of him while fully clothed.

Other lawsuits

During his testimony 35 years after the incident, Rapp agreed there had been “no kissing, no undressing, no reaching under clothes, and no sexualized statements or innuendo,“ during an incident that had lasted no more than two minutes.

Spacey has been hit by other charges in both the United States and Britain.

In August, a California judge ordered him to pay almost $31 million to the production company responsible for making the “House of Cards” series, from which he was fired when accusations of sexual harassment against him emerged.

In London, he is being prosecuted for sexual assault against three men between March 2005 and April 2013, when he was a theater director, and to which he pleaded not guilty last July.

And in Massachusetts, Spacey was charged with indecent assault and sexual assault on an 18-year-old bar worker in July 2016. The charges were dropped in July 2019. - AFP",Q4
https://www.courierpress.com/story/news/politics/elections/2018/11/05/election-day-liquor-laws-indiana-alcohol-sales-when-where-and-why/1889908002/,"Yes, you can buy alcohol on Election Day in Indiana. Here's when and why it changed.","Indiana has seen a slow unraveling of those lingering Prohibition-era alcohol bans, and Election Day was just the beginning.

Remember in 2012 when Barack Obama was vying for his second term against Republican Mitt Romney? That was the first time Hoosiers didn't have to wait for polls to close to buy an alcoholic drink on Election Day.

Can you buy alcohol on Election Day?

Yes, as long as you are 21 or older.

Indiana alcohol laws:Everything you need to know

When were alcohol sales allowed on Election Day?

According to IndyStar archives, a bill passed in 2010 paving the way for booze on the ballot. The bill included some other alcohol reforms: allowing the state's microbreweries to have carryout sales on Sundays; requiring retailers to card any customer who appears to be under the age of 50; and allowing bar, taverns and restaurants that sell alcohol to stay open on Sunday nights until 3 a.m. Monday instead of 12:30 a.m.

Why did the law change?

It was an issue of convenience, IndyStar reported in 2010.

Lawmakers pushed for the change as elections had become more frequent, plus the state had instituted voting centers with extended voting hours. Once during voting for a referendum on Nov. 3, IndyStar reported a line around 21st Amendment Liquors at 71st Street and Keystone Avenue, with customers waiting for the polls to close and the store to open.

Indiana was also one of the last states to lift the Election Day alcohol ban, IndyStar reported at the time.

The law also likely had roots in the historic use of taverns — being public gathering places — as polling places. Now most voting centers are in community centers, churches and school gymnasiums.

The 2012 election would have been the first time to put the new law into practice.

More alcohol bans get lifted

Other carryout alcohol bans were lifted after the Election Day change:

2015 was the first time Hoosiers could buy alcohol for carryout on Christmas Day, Dec. 25.

2018 was the first time Hoosiers could buy alcohol for carryout on Sundays. The bill came with a caveat: sales are only from noon to 8 p.m.

This means Indiana no longer has any days in which carryout alcohol sales are banned. Of course, businesses may choose to be closed at any time.

What's next for loosening Indiana's alcohol law? Well, it's probably not cold beer at grocery, convenience stores and gas stations.

https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-17/whos-on-trial-danny-masterson-or-the-church-of-scientology,Scientology church looms over actor Danny Masterson rape case,"Danny Masterson, at center in 2020, is charged with raping three women at his Hollywood Hills home between 2001 and 2003.

The two sides agree on one thing: The Church of Scientology is not on trial.

Yet, when prosecutors and actor Danny Masterson’s defense team met in a downtown Los Angeles courtroom recently for a final meeting before Masterson’s rape trial, much of the legal wrangling was over the role the controversial religion would play in the proceedings.

Masterson’s lawyers wanted Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charlaine Olmedo to bar any mention of Scientology throughout the trial, which is expected to begin Tuesday. Deputy Dist. Atty. Reinhold Mueller argued that he should have free rein to invoke Scientology.

Masterson, a Scientologist, is charged with raping three women between 2001 and 2003. The women allege he plied them with alcohol and sexually assaulted them at his Hollywood Hills home.

The women were also members of Scientology and allege that church officials tried to stop them from reporting Masterson to police.

One accuser testified that when she reported the rape to Scientology officials, she was told “not to use the ‘R-word.’” Another testified that a lawyer for Scientology came to her home and warned that she would be expelled from the church if she went to authorities about Masterson.

California Scientology’s secrets spill into open in Danny Masterson rape case Women who have accused Danny Masterson of rape testified that Scientology officials tried to stop them from reporting the alleged attacks to police.

“We’re going to work out how you can not lose your daughter,” the attorney told the woman’s father, according to her testimony.

“The trial is not about Scientology. The trial is about Danny Masterson. But that being said, the facts of what happened, why certain things happened, who was involved ... it’s so interwoven that certain parts of the trial will necessarily have to involve Scientology,” said Brian Kent, who represents Masterson’s accusers in a civil lawsuit they brought against the church and Masterson.

Masterson, who gained some level of celebrity for his role in the popular sitcom “That ’70s Show,” faces decades in prison if he is convicted of raping the women.

At a preliminary hearing last year, each of the women testified, recounting the alleged attacks in graphic detail. One said Masterson threatened her with a gun as he raped her while she faded in and out of consciousness.

“You’re not gonna f—ing tell anybody,” she recalled him saying.

Another accuser said she had awoken to Masterson, her boyfriend at the time, penetrating her. When she tried to stop him by pulling his hair, he hit her in the face, she testified.

The Times does not name victims of alleged sexual assault unless they choose to identify themselves.

Scientology practices were scrutinized during the preliminary hearing. Masterson’s accusers testified about a range of topics, including the religion’s “international justice chief,” described as the church’s ultimate authority, and “wog-law,” a term the church uses dismissively to refer to the secular world’s police and courts.

But that was not in front of a jury.

With impressionable jurors set to determine Masterson’s fate, his attorney Phillip Cohen argued at the hearing earlier this month that the actor’s proximity to the much-maligned religion will be used to paint him as guilty by association.

“It is disingenuous to say the government is not placing Scientology on trial,” Cohen told Olmedo. He added that being forced to battle over Scientology doctrine will make the trial an unfair “war on two fronts” and suggested the judge allow only nonspecific references to “the church.”

Prosecutors countered that Scientology, founded by L. Ron Hubbard in the 1950s, is fundamental to everything the women went through and should be mentioned by name at trial.

“It’s about their entire life being wrapped up in this church,” Mueller said at the Oct. 3 hearing. “If they don’t follow certain policies ... they lose that entire life.

“It’s not just as simple as not talking about Scientology,” he added, saying jurors would be confused if the prosecution referred to Scientology merely as a church.

Prosecutors also sought the judge’s permission to have a former Scientologist testify as an expert witness about the structure of the organization and how it operates.

Olmedo struck a middle ground in her ruling.

Saying the church’s “tentacles” undeniably reach into many facets of the trial, she excluded the prosecution’s proposed expert, but found that the religion is relevant. She rejected Cohen’s argument that it should not be named because of negative views jurors may have.

“Evidence presented in criminal cases often involve subject matters that many of the public view with disdain, including gangs, guns and violence,” Olmedo said. “The fact that any individual has a negative view of any particular subject matter does not, per se, render that person unfit to serve as a juror.”

The accusers can explain how Scientology led them to delay reporting their sexual assaults to police, Olmedo said. She added that they could tell jurors about their belief that church policy prohibits reporting crimes committed by other Scientologists to law enforcement.

The Church of Scientology declined to comment on the pending criminal matter, but said the religion has no policy against reporting crimes committed by Scientologists to law enforcement.

“Church policy explicitly demands Scientologists abide by all laws of the land,” spokeswoman Karin Pouw said.

The court is performing a balancing act, letting in references to Scientology where it is necessary to give context, while not allowing the case to devolve into a trial within a trial, said Lou Shapiro, a defense attorney and former public defender in Los Angeles County.

“Judges are reluctant to let trials go down rabbit holes,” Shapiro said.

Olmedo compared the case to the 2011 rape prosecution of Warren Jeffs, the self-proclaimed prophet of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The tenets of the Mormonism offshoot were admitted at trial to provide context for why a 15-year-old girl and a 12-year-old girl submitted to rapes at the hands of Jeffs, Olmedo said.

According to a list of potential witnesses filed in court, prosecutors plan to call Brie Shaffer, an actress and high-ranking Scientologist who has defended Masterson on social media in the past. They also may call Lisa Marie Presley, Elvis Presley’s daughter, a Scientologist who reportedly left the church in 2014.

Mike Rinder, a former high-ranking member who left the church in 2007, said Scientologists involved in other criminal cases have been relocated by church officials outside a court’s jurisdiction to keep them from testifying.

“There are certain people who apparently are very integral to the events ... and I wonder if they are going to appear at the trial,” Rinder said.

The three women alleging Masterson raped them are also plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed against the Church of Scientology in 2019. They say they were harassed and stalked by Scientology after reporting Masterson to police. The lawsuit will move forward after the criminal trial.

The women allege that representatives of Scientology followed them, came to their homes and went through their trash in an attempt to intimidate them.

One says in the suit that her dog may have been poisoned to death by representatives of the church.

Masterson’s lawyers fought to keep the allegations of stalking and harassment from the civil case out of the criminal trial.

“The only thing the jury could use this evidence to really consider would be emotional bias to convict Mr. Masterson based on the conduct of this alleged, uncharged co-defendant of the Church,” Karen Goldstein, another attorney for Masterson, said at the Oct. 3 hearing.

Goldstein noted that prosecutors had turned over to the defense a photo of the “admittedly ... very cute little dog.”

Olmedo ruled there was to be no mention of the dog. The women, she decided, can speak in general terms about the alleged harassment or stalking, but they cannot go into detail of specific incidents.

Israelis rally in support of Iranian protestors

Read on for article

Israelis gathered in downtown Jerusalem’s Independence Park Thursday evening for a rally in support of the Iranian people who have taken to the streets in recent weeks demanding greater freedom of expression and freedom of religion.

The woman pictured above holds a sign that says “Women, Life, Freedom.”

The Iranian protests were sparked in September when a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman named Mahsa Amini was killed while in police custody. Amini was arrested for not wearing a headscarf in public, as is required for all women under Iranian law which is based on strict enforcement of Muslim laws.

Since then, tens of thousands of Iranians have been protesting all over their country in a fearless show of defiance of their country’s authoritarian theocratic regime. Such massive national protests are reminiscent of the ones that broke out all over East Europe at the end of the 1980s, and those protests brought down numerous such oppressive regimes.

One of the people who spoke at the rally was Jerusalem’s Deputy Mayor in charge of foreign relations, international economic development and tourism Fleur Hassan-Nahoum. She is also the co-founder of the Gulf-Israel Women’s Forum.

One of the rally’s organisers, Hassan-Nahoum spoke with TPS about why she felt it was important for Israelis to come out and show their support for the Iranian people who are today fighting for religious freedoms.

“About a week and a half ago I saw that all over the Western world there are demonstrations in support of the women of Iran against the cruel regime that is killing them indiscriminately on the street,” she said, “…so we came out during the Jewish holidays to show our support for the Iranian women.”

“Israel has done more than any country to try and pull down the Iranian regime,” she added. “ And now we need the big countries of the west to stand up, every single country where there are equal rights for men and women should be standing with the women of Iran and working to bring down that horrible, misogynistic, homophobic and genocidal regime.”

On the matter of religious issues in Israel and how women in certain areas in the country are required to dress conservatively, Hassan-Nahoum adamantly rejected any comparisons between Israel and Iran, calling Iran a “Handmaid’s Tale” county.

Another organizer of the event was Ateret Violet Shmuel, Director of Indigenous Bridges USA.

She told TPS, “We here in Israel see what the people of Iran are dealing with, what they are going through. We see them. We hear them. We care.”

“We want the Iranian people to know that we see them and that we are standing in fierce and loyal solidarity with them, here in Israel,” she added.",Q4
https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/10/5/hks-osullivan-class-protest/,Anti-War Activists Protest Harvard Kennedy School Professor With Ties to Defense Contractor,"Over a dozen anti-war activists staged a protest against Harvard Kennedy School professor Meghan L. O’Sullivan Tuesday morning, disrupting a class she was teaching to first-year master’s of public policy students.

The protesters denounced O’Sullivan’s affiliation with Raytheon Technologies, a weapons manufacturing firm, and her role in the Bush administration during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

O’Sullivan served as deputy national security advisor for Iraq and Afghanistan in the Bush administration prior to joining the Harvard Kennedy School. She currently sits on Raytheon’s board of directors.

The protestors, most of whom were not affiliated with Harvard, burst into the classroom chanting “Meghan O’Sullivan, you can’t hide, we can see your war crimes” and “When missiles fly, people die, and O’Sullivan’s profits multiply,” while holding up a banner critical of O’Sullivan in front of the class.

HKS security personnel and the Harvard University Police Department responded to the demonstration, but no arrests were made as the protestors left campus on their own. It remains unclear how the protestors entered the Kennedy School.

Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote in a statement Tuesday evening that the school “encourages constructive discourse, including dissent and protest.”

“But students and teachers have the right to be heard in the classroom and to listen to others in the classroom, and disruption of those interactions hurts learning and is not tolerated,” Elmendorf said.

O’Sullivan declined to comment on the protest and the activists’ criticisms.

The protest at HKS was co-organized by Resist and Abolish the Military Industrial Complex — an activist group that has previously staged protests against Raytheon in Rhode Island and Cambridge — and United Against War and Militarism, an anti-imperialist organization.

A RAM INC spokesperson criticized Harvard’s decision to employ O’Sullivan as a professor because of her past work for the U.S. government and her affiliation with Raytheon.

“We want to expose the fact that Harvard Kennedy — in spite of the image it’s putting forward — is employing someone who profits every time bombs or missiles are dropped or launched at Palestine and Yemen,” the spokesperson said.

Quint Forgey, an HKS student who was in the classroom when protestors burst inside, said that “the class was definitely shaken” following the protest.

While the class was not canceled as a result of the incident, O’Sullivan did not return to teaching the planned material, according to Forgey. Instead, O’Sullivan and the students spent the rest of class time discussing the disruption.

“It transitioned into a frank, honest, and open dialogue between the students in the classroom and Professor O’Sullivan about her time in the Bush administration and students’ various reactions to the episode,” Forgey said.

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/oct/31/elon-musk-paul-pelosi-tweet-twitter,Elon Musk’s Paul Pelosi tweet proves he has no business running Twitter | Robert Reich,"Just three days after Elon Musk bought Twitter, he posted a tweet promoting the baseless allegation that Paul Pelosi, the husband of the speaker of the House, who was assaulted on Friday at the couple’s home, had been drunk and in a fight with a male prostitute.

The police found Paul Pelosi, 82, attacked with a hammer inside his home by a man, David DePape, who had entered through the back door, seeking the speaker.

Musk’s tweet, later deleted, came in response to a tweet posted on Saturday by Hillary Clinton, attacking Republicans for spreading “hate and deranged conspiracy theories” that she said had emboldened the man who attacked Nancy Pelosi’s husband.

In a reply to Clinton’s post, Musk wrote: “There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye” and then shared a link to an article in a faux newspaper, the Santa Monica Observer, in which the gonzo allegation about Paul Pelosi appeared.

This is the same Santa Monica Observer, by the way, that in 2016 claimed that Clinton had died and that a body double was sent to debate the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump.

If Musk’s tweet doesn’t raise bright red warning signs all over the world about his judgment and character, just days after he took over one of the planet’s largest and most influential media machines, I don’t know what will.

Doesn’t Musk know that the world is watching to see how responsible he is, as the new owner of Twitter? The fact that he personally posts such unhinged, dangerous drivel within three days of taking over the platform suggests he doesn’t give a damn.

Does he need reminding that America and the world are at a moment in history when hateful lies are having horrendous consequences? The husband of the speaker of the House was almost murdered because of such lies.

That Musk would choose this tragedy to demonstrate the disgusting extremes such hateful lies can reach is another indictment of his character and judgment.

We are just over a week until an election in which most Republican candidates for office are supporting Trump’s big lie that the 2020 election was “stolen” from him, in the most direct challenge to American democracy since the civil war.

Yet what is Musk’s response? To stir up even more divisiveness with yet another lie, while readying the platform for Trump’s imminent return.

Can anyone seriously believe Musk will be a responsible custodian of one of the most influential media outlets in the world?

Absurdly, Sunday’s tweet from Musk comes right after his vow in an open letter to advertisers that Twitter would not become a freewheeling site that allowed entirely unfettered commentary. “Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences,” he wrote. “Twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world.”

Rubbish. By posting the lie about Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Musk just demonstrated his willingness – no, eagerness – for Twitter to become a free-for-all hellscape.

I have long had my doubts about Musk’s character and judgment. He has repeatedly shown himself to be impetuous, unreliable, self-serving, and loony.

In March 2020 he tweeted that children were “essentially immune” to Covid. He has pushed cryptocurrencies that he’s invested in. When a college student started a Twitter account to track his private plane, Musk tried and failed to buy him off, before blocking him.

The Securities and Exchange Commission went after Musk after he tweeted that he had funding to take Tesla private, a clear violation of the law.

But his latest foray suggests I may have overestimated him.

No one in a decent, civil society should have the unchecked power Elon Musk has accumulated.

He must relinquish Twitter. If he does not, the rest of us should jump off his stinking ship.",Q4

Two prominent Latter-day Saint leaders joined the White House signing ceremony Tuesday as President Joe Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act into federal law.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints simultaneously released a statement praising those who helped create and pass the law, describing the successful effort to add religious liberty protections to its language “both historic and commendable.”

“Today’s a good day,” Biden said before signing the bill in a unique ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House, “a day America takes a vital step toward equality, toward liberty and justice, not just for some but for everyone — everyone — toward creating a nation where decency, dignity and love are recognized, honored and protected.”

Representing the church at Biden’s invitation were Elder Jack N. Gerard, a General Authority Seventy, and former Oregon Sen. Gordon Smith, who recently completed 10 years of service as an area seventy for the church.

“The signing of the Respect for Marriage Act today was a restatement of the existing law as defined by the Supreme Court or acknowledged and same sex marriage,” Elder Gerard said in a telephone interview. “But the significance for us is the Respect for Marriage Act acknowledges people with differences of opinion surrounding marriage and acknowledges our doctrine — marriage between one man and one woman — and provides the religious freedom protections necessary for us to continue to practice our faith and our doctrine, which remains unchanged.”

The Respect for Marriage Act redefines marriage for purposes of federal law as between two persons and grants federal protections to same-sex and interracial marriages. It was amended over the past two weeks to include federal protections for religious beliefs and freedoms.

Those protections ensure that churches and faiths can maintain their own doctrines and definitions of marriage and won’t be forced to perform or host same-sex marriages.

A number of faith groups attended the ceremony at Biden’s invitation, including Orthodox Jewish leaders and representatives from the Council for Christian Colleges & Universities, Elder Gerard said.

The new law includes specific language that says, “Diverse beliefs about the role of gender in marriage are held by reasonable and sincere people based on decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises.”

Elder Gerard said that and other amendments were critical to people of faith.

“It is really quite significant that the Congress recognized, and today the president signed, legislation that said people with views like ours of marriage between one man and one woman are honorable people who need to be respected and they should not have their faith or their practices challenged,” he said.

“Congress has now reaffirmed that our beliefs ‘are due proper respect,’” the church statement said. “The new law demonstrates that respect.”

“The law states that it can’t be used to harm religious or conscience rights for faith-based institutions,” the church statement continued. “It protects the tax-exempt status of religious organizations. It protects the grants, licenses, contracts and accreditation of religious schools. And it ensures that religious organizations, religious schools and their employees do not have to perform or host same-sex marriages or celebrations. No law is perfect. But putting such protections in the federal code is a big step forward.” (See the full church statement below.)

Religious leaders from various faiths played roles in amending the Respect for Marriage Act, which was passed by the House in July without any religious liberty protections.

Working together with LGBTQ advocates in and out of Congress, they and others helped craft amendments to the law that provided protections for religion. The amended bill drew 12 Republican senators to join all Democrats to pass the bill in the Senate. In the House, 39 GOP members voted for it.

“The church has been pleased to participate with many others in the difficult but worthy work of civil engagement that accompanied the passage of this bill,” the Church of Jesus Christ said in its statement.

The Respect for Marriage Act was a direct response to a written opinion by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas that the court should reconsider its 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which established a federal right to same-sex marriage.

That created concern that the court might overturn Obergefell and invalidate hundreds of thousands of same-sex marriages, though many court observers considered it unlikely.

The Respect for Marriage Act erases the Defense of Marriage Act, which had defined marriage federally as between a man and a woman and was already moot because it had been struck down by the Supreme Court.

The Respect for Marriage Act does not force states to grant same-sex marriage licenses, though that is the law of the land since Obergefell. If the court were to overturn Obergefell in the future, more than half the states already have laws on their books that would prohibit same-sex marriage, but the Respect for Marriage Act now requires those states to recognize same-sex marriages entered in other states. It also requires all states to recognize that same-sex couples are entitled to the same federal benefits as any other married couple.

The law protects interracial marriages by requiring states to recognize legal marriages regardless of “sex, race, ethnicity or national origin.”

Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina lobbied fellow Republican senators to pass the bill by noting that the Church of Jesus Christ and other religious groups supported it, PBS reported.

“They see this as a step forward for religious freedom,” Tillis said, because it supports rights for LGBTQ couples without infringing on religious groups’ right to believe as they choose.

The majority of Congressional Republicans still opposed the bill. They considered it unnecessary and expressed concerns about religious liberty.

The amended bill passed the Senate on Nov. 29. The House passed it on Dec. 8.

Elder Gerard, who has been the executive director of the Church Communication Department for nearly five years, has attended other White House signing ceremonies but said this one was unique because it was much larger than usual and included entertainment.

The South Lawn was packed with thousands of people from diverse groups, a representation of the bipartisan nature of the bill.

The event also included musical performances by Sam Smith, Cyndi Lauper and others.

Latter-day Saints for Biden-Harris hailed the bill signing as a symbol of finding common ground.

“Today, President Biden signed into law the Respect for Marriage Act, which uplifts human dignity by protecting the civil recognition of same-sex and interracial marriages,” the group said in a statement. “We are delighted by the broad support this bill has received from people of faith, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; a coalition of 45 religious and faith-based organizations including Latter-day Saints, Muslims, Unitarians and many more; Sikh and Jewish organizations; the NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice; the National Association of Evangelicals; and several other churches, congregations and faith-based groups.”

The National Association of Evangelicals supported the religious freedom protections in the bill but did not endorse the bill as a whole, a spokesperson said.

About 61% of Americans expressed a positive view of the impact of the legalization of same-sex marriage in a poll released last month by the Pew Research Center. Some 37% had a negative view.

Among those ages 18 to 29, 83% of Democrats and 64% of Republicans said the legalization of same-sex marriage is good for society, the center reported.

Here is the full statement from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:

“We extend a heartfelt thank you and our congratulations to all who played a part in the passage of the amended Respect for Marriage Act. Their efforts to protect religious freedom as Congress sought to codify the Supreme Court’s same-sex marriage decision are both historic and commendable.

“The amended Respect for Marriage Act specifically recognizes that ‘diverse beliefs about the role of gender in marriage are held by reasonable and sincere people based on decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises.’

“As re-stated last month, ‘the doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints related to marriage between a man and a woman is well known and will remain unchanged.’ Congress has now reaffirmed that our beliefs ‘are due proper respect.’

“The new law demonstrates that respect. The law states that it can’t be used to harm religious or conscience rights for faith-based institutions. It protects the tax-exempt status of religious organizations. It protects the grants, licenses, contracts and accreditation of religious schools. And it ensures that religious organizations, religious schools and their employees do not have to perform or host same-sex marriages or celebrations. No law is perfect. But putting such protections in the federal code is a big step forward.

“The church has been pleased to participate with many others in the difficult but worthy work of civil engagement that accompanied the passage of this bill. Like the church-supported Utah law in 2015, our efforts are helping the nation pursue freedom, fairness and respect for all.”

Haunted bridges connect Indiana and Illinois

SCIPRO/YouTube SCIPRO/YouTube loading...

One such bridge, near Vincennes, Indiana, that connects Indiana and Illinois over the Wabash River, goes by many names but has such an awful past that two of the names are terrifying, The Hangers Bridge and The Purple Head Bridge.

SCIPRO/YouTube SCIPRO/YouTube loading...

The bridge is very long at 1,441.0 Feet and connects Francisville: Lawrence County, Illinois, and Knox County, Indiana.

What is the legend of the Purple Head Bridge?

Two legends surround the bridge that involves horrifying deaths and agonizing cries for help.

According to OBSC Urban Legend, the first urban legend involves suicide.

It is said that long ago it was a place where a man jumped from the bridge to hang himself. When he did his head ripped off, and was never found. If you go there on a rainy night and park on the bridge and wait you will see a purple head floating toward you. The other story is the bridge is supposedly a bridge they hung people off of in the 1800s, giving it its name purple head. Another legend has it that if you go out there you will hear screams from the spirits that have been hung.

The other legend dates back to the French and Indian War.

During the bloody years of the French and Indian War, and in the early days of settlement thereafter in the land that only later came to be called Indiana, skirmishes between white settlers and Native Americans were fought continually along the banks of the Wabash, leaving many dead on both sides. And as is the way with war, many a time bodies of those fallen would not receive a proper burial.

SCIPRO/Canva SCIPRO/Canva loading...

If you make your way out across the bridge and wait near the center of the precipitous drop, the bloated purple head of the lost shaman will appear before you, luminous and pale, begging and pleading to be properly buried and released from his earthly imprisonment.

[OBSC Urban Legend]

Many, many people have reported seeing the blueish, purple head. Read a first-hand account of someone who saw the head while on the bridge., HERE.

The real name of the bridge is Stangle's Bridge, after the farmer who bought it. But, the bridge is also known as the Wabash Cannonball Bridge.

Whatever the name, this bridge is the creepiest. Watch a paranormal investigation of the bridge.

https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/kanye-proved-on-alex-jones-show-that-ww2-history-is-trauma-based-indoctrination/,KanYe Proved on Alex Jones Show That WW2 History is Trauma Based Indoctrination – Investment Watch Blog,"by Chris Black

The main thing for which KanYe is currently being crucified in both mainstream and so-called alt-right media is that he said a few times during his appearance on Alex Jones show that he likes things that National Socialists and Hitler in particular did in the past, plus he mentioned that what people know about the holocaust (and WW2 history at large) is factually wrong, including the 6 million meme.

It really looks like the left and the right are both singing a refrain of “he is mentally unwell”, but they are saying that in response to him talking about Hitler/National Socialism, which is kind of interesting.

What is it about Hitler that triggers 99% of people in every walk of life?

Maybe it is because America’s official religion since WW2 is Ashkenazi worship?

Keep in mind that KanYe said like 1000 times during the interview that he’s a born again Christian and loves everyone, including zionists, jews, Nazis, serial killers etc.

Jesus said to love everyone. Hitler is someone.

Thus Kanye loves Hitler, that’s pretty easy to understand.

I think his strategy is to push the Overton window to the max and destroy the taboos imposed by the powers that be on certain topics, or to break the programming so to speak.

By doing so, he is pinning the Bolshevik/Marxist left/right into an impossible position.

They can’t really harm him since he is a celebrity.

They can’t attack him since they will be called “racist”, with him being black and all that POC stuff.

They can’t agree with him because it would be “anti-Semitic”.

The thing is, people are conditioned to be ultra-sensitive on certain topics that are designed to fit a certain narrative about a certain population that controls the media and academia in the US/the West at large.

WW2 history is trauma-based conditioning, pure and simple, as most people have been conditioned since birth to see Hitler as a manifestation of everything evil in existence.

You’re programmed as a child into being told who the most evil man in history is.

You’re programmed by the ideas of millions gassed and tortured and whatever else traumatizing shit you don’t think about as a child, which is the same technique as showing a smoker’s lung next to a non-smokers lung.

This planet’s education system has a group of people who decide what the curriculum is, and they make sure you always think about little Anne Frank or “what famous things happened in Germany in WW2 “.

The current Western world is built on the post-WW2 status quo.

WW2 was the founding myth, Hitler is the Satan of it and holocaustianity replaced Christianity in the Western world.

Hitler has literally replaced Satan in modern mythology, and Kanye is breaking the conditioning.

Fun fact: your grandparents who fought in WW2 didn’t really have a problem with Germany other than the fact they were fucking with the USA’s economy.

90% of Americans were against the US entry in WW2, which was actually WW1 part deux .

Many were also against WW1, but the propaganda industry was determined to use Americans to fight and slaughter their brothers in Europe on behalf of central banking.

Progressive Republican Bob LaFollette filibustered the Senate till he collapsed to try to keep the (((Armed Ship Bill))) from passing and making US entry inevitable.

The famous Patton quote really does describe how a lot of WW2 vets felt about their Euro tour but it was ok because they believed in the USA.

Funny how in the late 80s and 90s the anti-Nazi propaganda ramped up significantly after decades of silence, almost as if they were trying to indoctrinate a new, young, and impressionable generation who had no prior context.

KanYe is making the case for free speech absolutism, with him saying the most unspeakable things, thus forcing “free speech” advocates to put up or shut up.

You can tell people that Genghis Khan, Mao or Stalin was your favorite leader from history and they won’t bat an eye.

Do the same with Hitler and they will think that you are a psychopath.

This is the text book definition of trauma based indoctrination, and kudos to KanYe for what he’s trying to do.

Hating Hitler is the core of brainwashing. If that breaks, it all breaks.

You will not be free until you accept that the big lie is real, accept that yes, history is written not by the good and just, but by the victors, and, most importantly, that both the “right” and the “left” in this country is owned by the same people, which have no ideology really, except from them being the chosen race of god and you the goy that must obey and serve them.

Ye is blowing the lid on it, and politicians and media are afraid they wouldn’t be able to play ball in the new paradigm.

I just hope that he doesn’t “die suddenly”. Pray for him, because he really needs it.",Q4

Brewer is on trial for fatally shooting an unarmed man with a homemade beanbag round out of his personal shotgun in 2017. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) The Associated Press

BELLE PLAINE, Kan. (AP) - Jury selection began Monday in the trial of a Kansas undersheriff in the fatal shooting of an unarmed man with a homemade beanbag round out of his personal shotgun, a case that comes amid a national reckoning on police violence.

Virgil Brewer, who was with the Barber County Sheriff's Office at the time, is facing a charge of reckless involuntary manslaughter for his deadly encounter with Steven Myers on Oct. 6, 2017. The shooting occurred in Sun City, a rural area about 300 miles (555 kilometers) from Kansas City, Kansas.

A civil lawsuit brought by Myers' family against Brewer and then-Barber County Sheriff Lonnie Small was settled in 2020 after county officials agreed to pay $3.5 million.

Brewer's criminal trial is expected to focus on whether his lack of knowledge and training with the less-lethal munitions amounted to a crime.

Defense attorney David Harger did not respond to messages seeking comment on the case. Brewer has been on unpaid leave since his 2018 arrest. He has been free pending trial.

'œThe fact of the matter is that it is not going to be a good outcome for anybody, no matter whether or not he gets convicted,"" Steven Myers' widow, Kristina Myers, told The Associated Press on Thursday. ""Yes, it will be over in that sense, but this one bad decision has ruined the lives of so many people.'ť

On the evening of Oct. 6, 2017, Brewer was carrying his personal weapon when he, along with the sheriff and a sheriff's deputy, responded to a call about a man holding a rifle on a street after an altercation at a local bar.

About five minutes before the fatal shooting, Small said: 'œA little luck and he'll just pass out and die,'ť a remark captured on the sheriff's body camera as they searched for Myers. They eventually found him hiding in a shed.

Both Brewer and the deputy later told the Kansas Bureau of Investigation that they could clearly see that Myers was not armed when they confronted him outside the shed, according to the probable cause affidavit obtained by AP.

Body camera footage reviewed by investigators shows Brewer repeatedly told Myers to 'œget on the ground'ť before shooting him outside the shed, while Deputy Mark Suchy gave conflicting commands to 'œput your hands up now.'ť Seconds later, Brewer shot Myers with one round.

Brewer told the Kansas Bureau of Investigation during an interview that he feared for his life and those of his deputies when Myers continued to walk toward them, adding he did not expect the beanbag round to penetrate Myers' chest.

The deputy's body camera video showed Myers was not making any aggressive movement at the time Brewer shot him, according to Bureau Agent Brian Carroll in an affidavit in support of the criminal charge against the undersheriff.

'œMyers was never told he was under arrest, Myers was never warned that his failure to comply with commands would result in the use of the impending force,'ť Carroll wrote.

Brewer then discharged his personal weapon at too close of a distance and shot Myers in the chest, a lethal force zone, according to the affidavit.

Carroll's affidavit contends that Brewer's lack of knowledge and training regarding the proper use of less-lethal beanbag munitions recklessly caused Myer's death. Proper training would have provided critical information about the proper distance to deploy the round and the proper target zone on a person.

Such training also would have informed Brewer about past problems with rectangular-shaped bean bags like the one he used, Carroll wrote. Those are known to penetrate subjects shot with them, and their use has been discontinued for years. The rounds used today are rounded, balloon-shaped bean bags, according to the affidavit.

Before coming to Kansas, Brewer worked in Texas, where he was given the beanbag ammunition used the evening of Myers' death. The affidavit revealed that the Kansas Bureau of Investigation interviewed Travis Martin, the deputy at the Freestone County Sheriff's Office in Texas who gave Brewer the ammunition.

Martin, who is expected to testify, told the agency that after speaking with the beanbag maker, that type of ammunition would no longer be carried and should not be fired on a person.

Martin told investigators that he 'œthought he had talked with Brewer about not using the ammunition on a person,'ť according to the affidavit.

Medical Examiner Timothy Gorrill is also expected to take the witness stand. His autopsy found the cause of death to be a penetrating shotgun bag wound to the trunk with the manner of death ruled a homicide.

Kristina Myers said she has been subpoenaed, adding she hopes to be allowed to watch the trial after her testimony.

'œIt doesn't bring him back, but it does give us a sense of justice,'ť she said. 'œEveryone, no matter their occupation, should be held responsible for their actions. All actions have consequences.'ť

https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/06/jewish-women-sue-kentucky-abortion-ban-defying-religious-rights-halakha/69536309007/,"Jewish women sue to block Kentucky abortion ban, say it violates religious freedom","Three Jewish women from Louisville filed a lawsuit Thursday morning to block Kentucky's laws banning most abortions from remaining in effect, arguing they are a violation of their religious rights under the state constitution.

Under current Kentucky laws, the protected human life of ""an unborn child"" begins when an egg is fertilized by a sperm, with abortion strictly prohibited once fetal cardiac activity is detected at roughly six weeks. Exceptions are only allowed to prevent a pregnant woman's death or a “substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.""

The plaintiffs in the case say Jewish law, known as Halakha, for millennia has not defined human life as beginning at conception, rather at birth — while the abortion ban passed into law in Kentucky ""has imposed sectarian theology on Jews.""

Their complaint, filed in Jefferson Circuit Court, states that Kentucky law particularly contradicts their constitutional religious rights when it comes to their past and intended future use of in vitro fertilization, in which a human egg is fertilized with sperm in a laboratory and then implanted in the uterus.

Abortion in Kentucky:'A unique kind of cruelty': Woman questioned about miscarriage speaks out at abortion forum

Lisa Sobel, the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, is the mother of one child through IVF, the only way she and her husband could conceive. Her IVF process was long, arduous and expensive, along with a medically difficult delivery, but she gave birth to a healthy girl in 2019.

While Sobel was considering having another baby, that calculus changed over the summer when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and Kentucky's trigger abortion ban went into effect — which she says makes any future IVF pregnancy both legally and physically dangerous.

""As a mom, as a woman, this directly affects me, it affects my health care,"" Sobel told The Courier Journal. ""And then it's a personal affront to my personal religious views, on top of it. As somebody who is a person of faith, that's just wrong to me.""

Sobel is one of two of the plaintiffs who are the mother of a child conceived through IVF, with plaintiff Jessica Kalb still paying to store nine frozen embryos for possible future use for a pregnancy. Plaintiff Sarah Baron is the mother of two who is considering IVF for a future pregnancy, while all three would be subject to advanced risks during a pregnancy due to being aged in their 30s and other unique health factors, the lawsuit says.

Because the IVF process often results in surplus fertilized embryos that must either be kept frozen at high costs or discarded by the clinics at the consent of donors, the lawsuit states Kentucky law would force these Jewish women to spend considerable sums to keep them frozen indefinitely or face potential prosecution under the state's fetal homicide law.

""Plaintiff’s religious beliefs demand that they have more children through IVF, yet the law forces Plaintiffs to spend exorbitant fees to keep their embryos frozen indefinitely or face potential felony charges,"" the complaint states. ""This dilemma forces Plaintiffs to abandon their sincere religious beliefs of having more children by limiting access to IVF and substantially burdens their right to freely exercise these sincerely held religious beliefs.""

The complaint seeks to void Kentucky's laws banning abortion, naming Attorney General Daniel Cameron and Jefferson County Commonwealth's Attorney Tom Wine as defendants who should be at least temporarily enjoined from enforcing them with criminal penalties.

Cameron — an abortion opponent who is currently defending the ban in another lawsuit from abortion providers, which is now before the Kentucky Supreme Court — said in a statement he had not yet received the complaint, but is ""committed to defending Kentucky’s pro-life laws.""

“The General Assembly has made it clear that Kentucky will protect unborn life and these laws are an important part of the Commonwealth,” Cameron said.

'Flatly cruel and degrading'

Among the five counts in the complaint in favor of voiding the abortion laws, two argue it should be struck down for its vagueness and unintelligibility, as they could create a ""patchwork"" of allowable reproductive practices that vary from county to county depending on the judge or prosecutor — as well as great uncertainty for women, doctors and clinics who don't know what they are allowed to do with unused embryos or implanted fetuses that have died or are not viable.

Stating that the disposal of a fertilized embryo (blastocyst) or termination of a nonviable fetus have no specific protection under law, the complaint contends both outcomes ""are strong possibilities for any IVF patient, and without legal protections for these medical procedures, IVF becomes legally dangerous if not impossible.""

The complaint also argues that the abortion ban is a direct violation of Kentucky's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which states the government ""shall not substantially burden a person's freedom of religion"" unless it proves clear and convincing evidence of a compelling governmental interest and uses the least restrictive means to further that interest.

Christian litigants have successfully cited this law and its federal companion in both state and federal courts to win recent cases, including those of a Louisville photographer who did not want to work same-sex weddings and a Lexington T-shirt company that refused to make gay pride shirts.

KY Abortion ban:On Election Day, you'll decide whether to ban abortion in Kentucky. Here's what to know

""Forcing a mother to deliver a dead fetus to term, or one that will certainly die moments after birth, does not advance a governmental interest to protect fetal life, is contrary to Jewish law, severely damages the mental health of the mother, is flatly cruel and degrading, does not promote 'life,' and serves no legitimate purpose at all,"" the complaint states.

The plaintiffs also argue the abortion ban violates Section 5 of the Kentucky Constitution by giving preference to sectarian Christianity and diminishing their privileges, rights and capacities on account of their Jewish faith.

Under current ""theocratic"" law, the complaint says the plaintiffs are essentially ""enjoined from reproduction,"" noting that procreation has ""a special place in Jewish law, thought, and tradition,"" especially since the massive genocide of the Holocaust.

Hearts, minds, votes and laws

While two similar lawsuits have been filed in Florida and Indiana to block state abortion bans on the grounds that it violates the religious freedom of Jewish people, the Kentucky lawsuit is the first one known to have named individual plaintiffs, according to Benjamin Potash and Aaron Kemper, who filed the complaint.

Sobel said she has never been an outwardly political person and taking this public action is ""very scary."" But she said she is stepping forward with her lawsuit because the ban has a direct effect on Jewish women and challenging it in court ""was really the only thing that I could think of to affect real change.""

After speaking with her attorneys, ""it became clear that this was something that I could do, and by putting my name on there, by putting my face out there, it becomes personal to other people and hopefully will help change hearts, minds and votes — and eventually laws.""

Noting that she ""almost died because I was bleeding out"" while delivering her child, Sobel said current Kentucky law would make another pregnancy much riskier if she attempted IVF again.

""It's really scary for me to go into a hospital. ... Having a natural miscarriage at this point is a risk, because they have to talk to their lawyers and they have to talk to other doctors to determine whether this is a naturally occurring miscarriage,"" she said. ""By the time they determine that, I could be dead.""

At a press conference Thursday afternoon of the plaintiffs and their attorneys, Kalb said she had hoped to use her remaining frozen embryos to have another child, but no longer felt safe legally or physically to do so.

""I was so afraid I was gonna get pregnant and go to a scan and hear, 'Your baby's not compatible with life,'"" Kalb said. ""After this law, that's no longer my greatest fear. Now, my greatest fear is that I become pregnant and I go to a scan and they say, 'Your baby is incompatible with life and we can't help you.' Because that's the reality right now in our state.""

""What's the pro-life position here?"" asked Potash. ""Should Lisa be able to have children? Because the way the law is written now, maybe not. So I think there's a lot of hypocrisy in this law, because it prevents people from giving birth in some circumstances, and it also forces people to give birth to a dead person. It's horrifying.""

Kemper said if it were determined that a fetus is not going to survive — which is more common with IVF — a high-risk patient like Sobel might have to be ""on the verge of death"" before a doctor believes they can legally end a pregnancy.

""It's cruel and violates Jewish law and the health of the mother and the mental health of the mother — and it's not the least restrictive means to promote life,"" Kemper said. ""So that's where it has a chilling effect, these vague laws without having exceptions.""

Sobel said she and the plaintiffs have received private support on the lawsuit from most of the rabbis and cantors in Louisville, spanning all denominations and ideologies.

""For us as a Jewish community, the issue isn't reform, conservative, orthodox, liberal or conservative,"" Sobel said. ""We are a united community on this issue because we have 2,000 years of understanding and commentary that tells us where the line is.""

Plaintiff attorneys 'drew inspiration' from AG filings

While Attorney General Cameron's immediate response to the lawsuit was to tout his support for ""pro-life laws,"" his office has frequently defended religious freedom and liberty in state and federal court filings in recent years.

Cameron, who is running for governor next year, has filed briefs in support of the religious liberty of military members and federal contractors who opposed COVID-19 vaccine mandates and churches who opposed early pandemic restrictions from Gov. Andy Beshear's administration on in-person services. He even asked the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down the Beshear administration's pandemic mandates on religious schools.

Just Wednesday, Cameron's gubernatorial campaign sent out an email heralding his work to stop vaccine mandates for military member on religious grounds, with the subject line: ""I’m Leading the Fight for Religious Liberty.""

Asked about Cameron's repeated support for religious freedom in his first three years in office and how he might square that with this complaint, Kemper noted their complaint had used his briefs as a sort of blueprint.

""I will say that in drafting our complaints and researching our complaints that we filed under the RFRA, we drew inspiration from some of the complaints that were filed during COVID-19 that the attorney general's office supported,"" Kemper said. ""And we drew on the case law that they cited as inspiration for our lawsuit.""

State health officials are encouraging the immunization of children against flu and COVID-19 without making changes to its list of other vaccines required for school entry in the fall of 2023.

The New Mexico Department of Health announced Wednesday its school immunization requirements for the next school year. There were no changes to the list of mandatory immunizations for maladies including measles, mumps, tetanus, polio and chicken pox.

Immunization for flu, coronavirus and papillomavirus at appropriate ages are recommended but not required.

Health Department Secretary David Scrase says the agency has never required vaccinations for viral respiratory illnesses but is encouraging them based on an influx of young children getting sick with viruses including COVID-19, flu and respiratory syncytial virus. The influx of patients is straining hospital pediatric units.

""Vaccinating children against flu and COVID-19 would help prevent disease spread, severe illness and long-term complications in children,"" Scrase said in a statement.

Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, usually results in mild, cold-like symptoms and can cause severe breathing problems for babies.

A state vaccine advisory committee typically convenes once a year to discuss requirements for the upcoming school year. It met Nov. 3.

Maestas appointed to state Senate following bitter debate and dark accusations - By Patrick Lohmann, Source New Mexico

Longtime Westside Albuquerque Rep. Antonio “Moe” Maestas will serve two years in the New Mexico Senate, an appointment that came at the end of a Bernalillo County Commission meeting punctuated with accusations of “schemes” and “conspiracy theories.”

The commission was tasked with appointing the replacement for former Sen. Jacob Candelaria, a longtime Democrat who recently changed his party affiliation to “decline to state.” He announced his resignation Oct. 19, saying he wants to start a family.

Maestas, who has represented a Westside seat for 16 years, immediately announced his interest in Candelaria’s seat, and Candelaria threw his support behind him.

Because the district’s lines are fully within Bernalillo County, the commission is required to name his replacement. Two commissioners immediately raised concerns about Maestas and whether Candelaria’s seat should would be filled before others had a chance to apply for the seat.

Another commissioner countered that delaying the vote would deprive the area of a representative for too long. Candelaria, in posts on Twitter, also said extending the timeline was a Mitch McConnell-style tactic aimed at stalling the appointment until a new commission is seated in early January — one that might be less favorable to Maestas.

Commissioner Debbie O’Malley, who pushed for postponing the appointment, also raised concerns Tuesday night about Maestas’ wife, lobbyist Vanessa Alarid, and a $5,000 donation she gave to a commissioner who ultimately voted for Maestas, Charlene Pyskoty. O’Malley said the donation was a way to buy Pyskoty’s vote, and O’Malley unsuccessfully tried to get Pyskoty to recuse herself and also to pause the appointment vote until after an ethics complaint regarding the matter is heard on Dec. 3.

“I believe she should recuse herself from the vote for the senator replacement, because Ms. Alarid’s husband is one of the nominees,” O’Malley said. “I think this is important because we are making an appointment in lieu of an election.”

Pyskoty denied any wrongdoing and said she wasn’t giving Maestas any special treatment. She also said that his spouse’s position as a lobbyist should have no bearing on the appointment before them.

“Vanessa Alarid is not the candidate here. It’s her husband. And he has never given me one thin dime,” Psykoty said. “And I’ve only spoken to him just a handful of times. I’ve spoken to all the candidates, all the applicants, in this process.”

Pyskoty and O’Malley have disagreed sharply on the matter before. The last time the topic came up at the commission’s Oct. 25 meeting, O’Malley called Pyskoty a slur after the meeting, according to the Albuquerque Journal. She apologized on Tuesday, but she also spelled out what she said was a “scheme” a year in the making to get Maestas a Senate seat.

She said during the meeting that Maestas has tried to use redistricting at the county and state level to ensure he had an easy path to Candelaria’s seat, and she accused him of depriving constituents the chance to weigh in on their next senator.

“What is disturbing … and very suspect is the fact that Rep. Maestas and Sen. Candelaria denied the voters in their districts, their constituents, the people they’re supposed to be fighting for, the right to choose their representative in the Legislature for over the next two years,” she said.

Maestas, reached briefly after the meeting, denied that he’d “schemed” to get the appointment. He said he learned along with the rest of the public that Candelaria was going to resign. And he said O’Malley is accusing him of the same tactics she’s employed in her political career as a commissioner and Albuquerque city councilor.

“It’s just amazing that people judge other people based on what they would do,” he said. “That’s how she rolls. She thinks everybody else rolls like her.”

O’Malley could not be reached after the meeting.

Three commissioners — a majority — voted for Maestas. They are Pyskoty, vice-chair Walt Benson and Steven Michael Quezada.

Maestas and seven other applicants threw their names in the hat to be appointed senator. They included Julie Radoslovich, director of the South Valley Academy, along with retired county commissioner and former Albuquerque City Councilor Steve Gallegos, and Em Ward, a doctor.

Radoslovich got two votes in favor of her appointment, the most of any other applicant. O’Malley and Chairperson Adriann Barboa voted for her. And about a dozen supporters stood up to speak in her favor, including former students and colleagues.

Quezada, who attended the meeting remotely, nominated Maestas for the seat, his voice piped in on the overhead speakers. Before he voted Tuesday night, via screen, he accused O’Malley of throwing out a half-baked theory about Maestas without evidence.

“To put conspiracy theories forward sounds a lot like MAGA (Make America Great Again) to me. But at the end of the day – yeah, you can roll your eyes,” he said, apparently seeing O’Malley’s reaction on the video stream. “That’s okay. The whole world saw that. But that’s the truth. You have no facts to base your conspiracy theories. I think this wasn’t a place to have that conversation.”

Quezada had, minutes earlier, suggested that Barboa — the chair and herself a registered lobbyist — might be conspiring to appoint a state lawmaker that she could lobby when the legislative session begins in January.

“If there’s a commissioner that’s a registered lobbyist that is herself or himself, appointing legislators or appointed officials, perhaps maybe that also could be looked at as a conflict of interest,” he said. “And I’m hoping that the news media will also look into that.”

Barboa, near the end of the meeting, defended her lobbying as being on behalf of reproductive rights and affordable health care. She has lobbied for Forward Together since 2013, according to the Openness Project.

”So I don’t work as a lobbyist with corporations or businesses,” she said. “I get to work for a nonprofit and with issues, by the people.”

Maestas will soon be sworn in as senator.

The commission will also have to replace him in the state’s House of Representatives, because his district also sits in Bernalillo County. It’s not clear yet whether that appointment will be as contentious.

However, the commission did vote on Tuesday to try to clean up the appointment process to potentially avoid this kind of acrimony. Now, the commission chair will be required to set a special meeting to name an appointment within three weeks of receiving a resignation letter from a lawmaker leaving ar seat.

The commission has named 11 replacement state lawmakers since 2015.

New Mexico officials warn of potential disruptions to county-level election certifications - By Ryan Lowery, Source New Mexico

Voters statewide cast ballots last week to decide a number of races and local issues, and now that those votes have been counted, it’s up to county canvassing boards and commissions to complete the legal process of certifying election results.

The certification process is typically quick and straightforward, but in recent elections, unfounded fears, conspiracy theories and outright lies have caused delays. So far, no county has indicated plans to delay certification that are due in a few days, but the Secretary of State’s Office and the New Mexico Office of the Attorney General issued a joint statement Tuesday notifying county commissions that a legal team is ready to “take action against any attempts to interfere with legal certification.”

Under state law, each of the state’s 33 counties must have a canvassing board conduct a formal inspection of the election results. These boards then review vote totals and either certify the totals or order a recount.

In counties with 150,000 or more voters, the board has up to 13 days after the election to declare the results. In smaller counties, canvassing boards are required to declare certification no later than 10 days after an election.

Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver and Attorney General Hector Balderas, through the joint statement, said they’re aware of election conspiracy theorists who might attempt to “enlist county commissions” to thwart legal certification of the 2022 general election results.

“These tactics are not new and were seen during the 2022 primary election when Otero County (influenced by these same election conspiracy theorists) attempted to neglect their legal duties and not certify the results of that election,” the statement said.

The Otero reference relates to an incident earlier this year when the County Commission initially refused to certify the results of the state’s June 7 primary election over distrust of vote-counting machines manufactured by Dominion Voting Systems, a Denver-based company that has been the target of many of former President Donald Trump’s false claims about fraudulent 2020 election results.

The board ultimately voted 2-1 to certify the results, but only after the state Supreme Court and the AG’s office stepped in.

The Otero County Commission — now composed of Republican Vickie Marquardt, Republican Gerald Matherly and Democrat Stephanie DuBois — unanimously voted Tuesday to certify the canvass of the 2022 general election.

Though no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud or manipulation of tallying machines has been found, Commissioner Marquardt said she still believes fraud is taking place nationwide.

“I think there is a fight for the elections in this country. I think it’s ongoing,” she said. “I think we all need to stay involved in it, but not certifying these elections — the only thing that’s going to do is probably get Gerald (Matherly) and I removed from office.”

Chaco drilling ban will likely only put a small dent in oil and gas production in region – Shaun Griswold, Source New Mexico

A plan to bar new oil and gas leases within Chaco Canyon National Historic Park for 20 years will only slightly reduce the activity of extractive mineral industries, according to an environmental assessment released last week by the U.S. Interior Department.

The federal government announced a halt to new leases on about 338,690 acres within a 10 mile-radius in Chaco Canyon in January 2022.

The news was met with celebration by tribal entities and environmental groups, but advocates were concerned that the proposal wouldn’t apply to existing leases or to areas outside the buffer zone, so drilling would continue around the sacred site.

“There’s still going to be development going on in that 10-mile buffer, and there’s nothing to prohibit that,” said Carol Davis, director of Diné CARE, told the news publication Grist a month after the announcement. “And that’s going to expose people to the adverse health impacts that are a result of oil and gas fracking.”

The Interior Department projects that within the Chaco Canyon buffer zone, where new leases are not permitted, natural gas producers will see a reduction of less than 1% in their output. Oil and gas companies could see about 2.5% less production than in years before the ban.

The Chaco region is a large swath of northwest New Mexico, and it’s considered a checkerboard area because of the way small parts of the Navajo Nation dot the landscape.

On a state level, New Mexico already has a 12-mile buffer zone banning new oil and gas leases on state land around Chaco that went into effect in 2019.

That executive order was signed by state Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard.

“The moratorium on oil and gas drilling does not mean there’s a moratorium on activity. I mean, we haven’t decided what activity would occur obviously, right in this area,” she said. “We are still contemplating what uses that land would be for.”

Garcia Richard won re-election last week with 55% of voters saying yes to another four-year term for the commissioner. She supports the federal government’s approach to Chaco Canyon, she said, and if it weren’t for limits imposed by state law, she’d make the state’s ban in the area extend for longer. It’s set to expire in Dec. 2023, and she’s already preparing to seek a renewal.

She said the State Land Office has not seen any impact from the ban on oil and gas revenue to the state. In fact, the industry is making record profits. For fiscal year 2022, New Mexico earned more than $2.4 billion for business on state lands, the majority of which comes from oil and gas. That nearly doubled the agency’s record for revenue in a single year, Garcia Richard said.

“This is not necessarily that impactful to production. But it’s still, you know, it’s a worthy thing to do because this area is so sacred and significant to so many in our state,” she said.

Windfalls of millions in revenue are attractive for any state, but the boom-and-bust nature of the industry is a lingering concern for people like Rebecca Sobel.

Sobel, organizing Director for WildEarth Guardians, said she approves of the moves Garcia Richard has made to protect Chaco Canyon and would like to see the moratorium expanded. She does hold some concerns that the federal government isn’t doing enough to hold the industry accountable.

“I think it’s all too common of a trope in New Mexico, to be concerned for the self-interest of the oil and gas industry because our state budget is held hostage by industry profits,” Sobel said. “The entire Greater Caco landscape deserves protection. The Chaco Canyon culture doesn’t stop at the 10-mile buffer. The Chaco landscape is a living culture where communities still reside.”

The State Land Office is taking part in the Honoring Chaco Initiative where the Interior Department is hosting discussions between tribal leaders, business, state, federal and other parties invested in the future of stewardship in the area.

This part of the process is welcome by both Sobel and Garcia Richard because it brings tribal interests to the table while negotiating action plans.

“It’s encouraging to see Secretary Haaland try to run the Interior differently, especially with this initiative, getting tribes to come to the table to have their own voice and deciding what’s in their own self-interest,” Sobel said. “It’s a really important step that it’s happening, but it’s still yet to be seen what the outcomes of this process are going to be because the greater Chaco landscape has a legacy of issues dealing with the results of being sacrificed for decades.”

Garcia Richard said the expertise was obvious.

“There’s not going to be anybody but a tribal member who will know the significance of these issues we’re working on,” Garcia Richard said.

From the moment she started drafting the drilling lease moratorium for New Mexico, Garcia Richard made sure to include tribal interests in her plans, she said, eventually collaborating with and gathering support from leaders within Indigenous communities to work with environmental groups and others in presenting the final order.

She’s excited to see the federal government follow up with a similar approach.

“This land is ancestral to tribes in New Mexico, and it’s sacred and significant to tribes in New Mexico,” Garcia Richard said. “The one thing I probably would caution anyone who wants to undergo tribal constitution is not to make it just kind of a de facto, checkbox process. Consultation should be done early, often, and it should be meaningful.”

She said during the meeting that Maestas has tried to use redistricting at the county and state level to ensure he had an easy path to Candelaria’s seat, and she accused him of depriving constituents the chance to weigh in on their next senator.

“What is disturbing … and very suspect is the fact that Rep. Maestas and Sen. Candelaria denied the voters in their districts, their constituents, the people they’re supposed to be fighting for, the right to choose their representative in the Legislature for over the next two years,” she said.

Maestas, reached briefly after the meeting, denied that he’d “schemed” to get the appointment. He said he learned along with the rest of the public that Candelaria was going to resign. And he said O’Malley is accusing him of the same tactics she’s employed in her political career as a commissioner and Albuquerque city councilor.

“It’s just amazing that people judge other people based on what they would do,” he said. “That’s how she rolls. She thinks everybody else rolls like her.”

O’Malley could not be reached after the meeting.

Three commissioners — a majority — voted for Maestas. They are Pyskoty, vice-chair Walt Benson and Steven Michael Quezada.

Maestas and seven other applicants threw their names in the hat to be appointed senator. They included Julie Radoslovich, director of the South Valley Academy, along with retired county commissioner and former Albuquerque City Councilor Steve Gallegos, and Em Ward, a doctor.

Radoslovich got two votes in favor of her appointment, the most of any other applicant. O’Malley and Chairperson Adriann Barboa voted for her. And about a dozen supporters stood up to speak in her favor, including former students and colleagues.

Quezada, who attended the meeting remotely, nominated Maestas for the seat, his voice piped in on the overhead speakers. Before he voted Tuesday night, via screen, he accused O’Malley of throwing out a half-baked theory about Maestas without evidence.

“To put conspiracy theories forward sounds a lot like MAGA (Make America Great Again) to me. But at the end of the day – yeah, you can roll your eyes,” he said, apparently seeing O’Malley’s reaction on the video stream. “That’s okay. The whole world saw that. But that’s the truth. You have no facts to base your conspiracy theories. I think this wasn’t a place to have that conversation.”

Quezada had, minutes earlier, suggested that Barboa — the chair and herself a registered lobbyist — might be conspiring to appoint a state lawmaker that she could lobby when the legislative session begins in January.

“If there’s a commissioner that’s a registered lobbyist that is herself or himself, appointing legislators or appointed officials, perhaps maybe that also could be looked at as a conflict of interest,” he said. “And I’m hoping that the news media will also look into that.”

Barboa, near the end of the meeting, defended her lobbying as being on behalf of reproductive rights and affordable health care. She has lobbied for Forward Together since 2013, according to the Openness Project.

”So I don’t work as a lobbyist with corporations or businesses,” she said. “I get to work for a nonprofit and with issues, by the people.”

Maestas will soon be sworn in as senator.

The commission will also have to replace him in the state’s House of Representatives, because his district also sits in Bernalillo County. It’s not clear yet whether that appointment will be as contentious.

However, the commission did vote on Tuesday to try to clean up the appointment process to potentially avoid this kind of acrimony. Now, the commission chair will be required to set a special meeting to name an appointment within three weeks of receiving a resignation letter from a lawmaker leaving ar seat.

The commission has named 11 replacement state lawmakers since 2015.

Judge orders end to Trump-era asylum restrictions at border - By Elliot Spagat Associated Press

A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Biden administration to lift Trump-era asylum restrictions that have been a cornerstone of border enforcement since the beginning of COVID-19.

U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ruled in Washington that enforcement must end immediately for families and single adults, calling the ban ""arbitrary and capricious."" The administration has not applied it to children traveling alone.

Within hours, the Justice Department asked the judge to let the order take effect Dec. 21, giving it five weeks to prepare. Plaintiffs including the American Civil Liberties Union didn't oppose the delay.

""This transition period is critical to ensuring that (the Department of Homeland Security) can continue to carry out its mission to secure the Nation's borders and to conduct its border operations in an orderly fashion,"" government attorneys wrote.

Sullivan, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, wrote in a 49-page ruling that authorities failed to consider the impact on migrants and possible alternatives.

The ruling appears to conflict with another in May by a federal judge in Louisiana that kept the asylum restrictions.

If Sullivan's ruling stands, it would upend border enforcement. Migrants have been expelled from the United States more than 2.4 million times since the rule took effect in March 2020, denying migrants rights to seek asylum under U.S. and international law on grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19.

The practice was authorized under Title 42 of a broader 1944 law covering public health.

Before the judge in Louisiana kept the ban in place in May, U.S. officials said they were planning for as many as 18,000 migrants a day under the most challenging scenario, a staggering number. In May, migrants were stopped an average of 7,800 times a day, the highest of Joe Biden's presidency.

Immigration advocacy groups have pressed hard to end Title 42, but more moderate Democrats, including U.S. Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Raphael Warnock of Georgia, wanted it to stay when the administration tried to lift it in May.

The ban has been unevenly enforced by nationality, falling largely on migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador — in addition to Mexicans — because Mexico allows them to be returned from the United States. Last month, Mexico began accepting Venezuelans who are expelled from the United States under Title 42, causing a sharp drop in Venezuelans seeking asylum at the U.S. border.

Nationalities that are less likely to be subject to Title 42 have become a growing presence at the border, confident they will be released in the United States to pursue their immigration cases. In October, Cubans were the second-largest nationality at the border after Mexicans, followed by Venezuelans and Nicaraguans.

The Homeland Security Department said it would use the next five weeks to ""prepare for an orderly transition to new policies at the border.""

""We continue to work with countries throughout the Western Hemisphere to take enforcement actions against the smuggling networks that entice migrants to take the dangerous and often deadly journey to our land borders and to address the root causes of irregular migration that are challenging our hemisphere as a whole,"" the department said.

ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said Sullivan's decision renders the Louisiana ruling moot.

""This is an enormous victory for desperate asylum seekers who have been barred from even getting a hearing because of the misuse of public laws,"" Gelernt said. ""This ruling hopefully puts an end to this horrendous period in U.S. history in which we abandoned our solemn commitment to provide refuge to those facing persecution.""

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel for the American Immigration Council, an immigrant advocacy group, distinguished Sullivan's ruling from the one by U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays in Louisiana, an appointee of President Donald Trump, which applied only to how the Biden administration tried to end Title 42. Sullivan found the entire rule invalid.

New Mexico begins certification process for midterm election - By Morgan Lee Associated Press

Midterm election results were certified Tuesday by at least three county commissions in New Mexico at the start of a once-routine process that in some locations has become a focal point for those voicing distrust in voting systems.

Among the decisions, Otero County's three county commissioners voted unanimously to certify Nov. 8 election results at a meeting in Alamogordo after a briefing by the county's top elections official.

The Otero County commission in June initially refused to certify primary election results while citing distrust of voting systems used to tally the vote — even though County Clerk Robyn Holmes said there were no problems. The commission reversed course on a 2-1 vote to certify the primary after Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver successfully petitioned the state Supreme Court to issue an order directing the local board to certify.

On Tuesday, Otero County Commission Chairwoman Vickie Marquardt commended the work of local election officials in the midterm election.

She said she still believes there are election problems in the U.S. but noted that county commissioners have limited oversight authority under New Mexico state law.

""We're basically like notaries,"" Marquardt said. ""The county commission cannot remove the voting machines, we cannot demand a hand recount. ... And I know that you guys wish that it was in our authority. But it's not.""

Commissioners in Socorro and Curry counties also voted unanimously to certify local election results.

Most of the state's 33 counties have until Friday to review any election discrepancies presented by county clerks and vote on certification. Those decisions are typically followed by a review of the state canvassing board, automatic recounts in close races and a post-election audit.

Attempts to delay primary results in a handful of New Mexico counties earlier this year have brought new scrutiny to a process that typically takes place quietly in the weeks after Election Day.

Partisan officials are involved in certifying elections in most states, something experts worry about after nearly two years of conspiracy theories falsely claiming the 2020 presidential election was stolen from former President Donald Trump. There is no evidence of widespread fraud or manipulated voting machines, and reviews in battleground states confirmed Democrat Joe Biden's win.

In Otero County in June, the dissenting vote against certification came from Couy Griffin, who was removed from office in September and barred from public office by a state judge for engaging in insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

The state Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear an appeal by Griffin of his removal and banishment from public office. Griffin and his attorney in the case could not immediately be reached for comment.

Griffin, a founder of the Cowboys for Trump, a group that has staged horseback parades to spread Trump's conservative message, said his vote against certification of the primary was based on his ""gut feeling,"" but he didn't cite any specific discrepancies in the vote tally.

In the midterm election, voters in staunchly conservative Otero County favored Republican candidates by wide margins in statewide races for governor, attorney general and secretary of state. Democrats won every statewide elected office on the ballot and flipped a congressional seat in southern New Mexico.

Preliminary elections results show more than 60% of Otero County voters cast ballots for Republican candidate for Secretary of State Audrey Trujillo, who aligned her campaign with a coalition that seeks large-scale changes to elections administration.

Hobbs woman accused of dumping baby could face Dec. 19 trial – KRQE-TV, Associated Press

A young Hobbs woman accused of abandoning her newborn by putting the baby into a trash container in near-freezing temperatures last January could go on trial next month.

KRQE-TV reported Tuesday that New Mexico prosecutors have a tentative start date of Dec. 19.

Prosecutors say Alexis Avila is charged with child abuse resulting in great bodily injury with the alternative of attempted murder.

A group of people looking through the container behind a Hobbs shopping center told authorities they heard cries and found a baby boy wrapped in a dirty blanket with an umbilical cord still attached.

They tried to keep the child warm until police and paramedics arrived. Authorities estimated the baby had been in the trash container for six hours and had hypothermia symptoms but survived.

According to a criminal complaint, Avila said she didn't know she was pregnant until Jan. 6 when she went to a doctor for stomach pain. She gave birth in a bathroom at her family's home following day.

Avila was 18 at the time and told police she panicked and didn't know what to do or who to call.

Investigators used surveillance video to identify a car suspected of being involved and that led them to Avila with search warrants turning up blood evidence.

The baby now named Saul remains in the care of his teenage father, who said Avila told him that she had a miscarriage.

GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas — An investigation is underway after a maintenance worker was fatally shot while checking on waterlines at an apartment complex in Grand Prairie on Saturday evening, police said.

Officers responded to a shooting call around 6 p.m. at the Clayton Pointe Apartments along the 2900 block of Alouette Drive near Arkansas Lane and Highway 360.

Upon arrival at the scene, police said they found an apartment complex maintenance worker identified as 53-year-old Cesar Montelongo injured with a gunshot wound on a resident's balcony. Montelongo was then transported to a hospital, where he was later pronounced dead, per a release issued by police.

Police said their investigation revealed that Montelongo was checking on multiple balconies for frozen or busted waterlines after pipes had burst throughout the apartment complex due to the recent arctic blast that has plagued the region.

According to police, a resident spotted Montelongo on his balcony, believed his apartment was being burglarized and shot Montelongo through a window.

Police said the resident stayed at the scene and cooperated with detectives. He was not arrested.

Further details are not yet being released as the investigation continues. The case will be referred to the Tarrant County grand jury for review, police said.

Cesar Montelongo Jr. told WFAA that his father and mother, Candelaria, had planned on celebrating their 29th wedding anniversary on Christmas Day.

""And it's sad that morning, the morning of the 24th, they went and had a breakfast date together because they knew everything was going to be closed on Christmas and then he didn't make it to the anniversary,"" Montelongo Jr. said.

Montelongo Sr. was a husband and father to five sons.

Montelongo Jr. said his father was the lead maintenance worker at the apartment complex for 16 years.

""We don't know who the suspect is. We don't know what state they were in. We just know that that happened,"" the victim's son said.

""My dad was a huge man of faith. My mother is a huge woman of faith. And so we're just believing and trying to get through it,"" he added.

This comes after it was revealed Cardwell secretly got married after finding out she had stage 4 cancer.

Cardwell, who was the daughter of the Here Comes Honey Boo Boo star, had previously revealed that she was battling adrenal cancer that progressed to stage 4.

Cardwell tied the knot with partner Eldridge Toney on March 4 in Wilkinson County, Georgia while undergoing chemotherapy, after previously expressing her desire to wed two months prior while she still felt well enough , reports TMZ.

Anna's sister Pumpkin's husband was the officiant of the ceremony with source revealing the wedding included close family and a camera crew recording footage for reality show, Mama June: From Not to Hot.

The mother of two girls, Kaitlyn, 11, and Kylee, eight, underwent chemotherapy and immunotherapy in an attempt to beat her cancer - and had been determined to welcome a child with Toney before her diagnosis, enduring four miscarriages.

In 2021 she told the US Sun: 'We are trying to have a third child, and it’s been difficult. I’ve gone through four miscarriages and a D&C.

""'It's been a long bumpy road for us trying to have baby number three.'

Her last miscarriage came two days before Christmas - the month before she was diagnosed with cancer - and she discovered that she wasn't making enough progesterone which was 'keeping the baby from getting enough nutrition.'

Mama June , 44, announced her daughter's death in an Instagram post on Sunday

Mama June, 44, announced her daughter's death in an Instagram post on Sunday.

Two days before her somber announcement, the reality star had asked her fans and followers on social media to pray for her ailing daughter.

'With the breaking heart, we are announcing that @annamarie35 is no longer with us,' June began her heartbreaking post. 'She passed away in my home last night peacefully at 11:12 PM.'

'She gave one hell of a fight for 10 months she passed away with her family around her like she won’t and we will will be updating y’all with more information as we get it today [sic],' Shannon continued.

'We love y’all and continued prayers and thoughts for our family [during] this difficult time,' she added.

Accompanying the caption was a photo of Mama June and her family, including Anna, who sported short hair amid her cancer treatments.

Anna was diagnosed with stage four adrenal cancer in January after complaining of stomach pain.

The Mayo Clinic reports adrenal carcinoma is a rare cancer that affects the adrenal glands in the kidneys. The adrenal glands produce hormones which deliver instructions to virtually every organ and tissue in the body.

The mother of two girls, Kaitlyn, 11, and Kylee, eight, underwent chemotherapy and immunotherapy in an attempt to beat her cancer.

Over the summer, the From Not to Hot star revealed that Anna's cancer was terminal.

'I’m so glad that you waited til i was home to take your last breath! I would’ve loved for you to get to see me graduate college but i know you will forever cheer me on in heaven!' she said in the caption.

'We will all make sure your legacy lives on forever. And i promise to always make sure to celebrate our birthday like you never left! The sky looks a little bit different today. We will always love you Anna,' a heartbroken Honey Boo Boo added.

And finally, she said, 'You hit me hard with his one Anna but i know [you're] in a better place now and pain free forever!'

Mastriano, a state senator, sought to overturn the 2020 election in Pennsylvania.

Shapiro, Pennsylvania's attorney general, is painting Mastriano as an extremist.

Republican Doug Mastriano and Democrat Josh Shapiro are running in a consequential open race for governor of Pennsylvania.

Polls close in the state at 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

Pennsylvania's gubernatorial candidates

Shapiro, Pennsylvania's current attorney general, easily cleared the field for the Democratic nomination and is running a campaign focused on the economy, abortion rights, and protecting democracy.

Mastriano, a Republican state senator first elected in 2019, narrowly emerged from a fractured field of Republican candidates for Pennsylvania governor in May.

Mastriano is perhaps best known for pushing the lie that the 2020 election was stolen and leading the efforts in Pennsylvania to overturn President Donald Trump's loss in the 2020 election in Pennsylvania.

His campaign organized transport to the protests over the election in Washington, DC, on January 6, which he also attended — but he did not enter the Capitol. Mastriano, as governor, would have the power to appoint Pennsylvania's chief election official.

Mastriano has also proposed instituting an abortion ban after six weeks of pregnancy in Pennsylvania, and he has rejected the notion of separation of church and state — part of an emerging political effort among Christian nationalists.

In his ads, Shapiro has hammered Mastriano as an extremist, including highlighting his position on abortion and his ties to far-right and nationalist figures.

Mastriano has also deployed a novel campaign strategy of shunning the mainstream media for his interviews and from his campaign events. He has instead relied on social media and other far-right media platforms to campaign and broadcast his message.

Pennsylvania's voting history

Pennsylvania is a competitive swing state that backed Trump by 1.2 points in the 2016 presidential election. It flipped during the 2020 presidential election, backing Democrat Joe Biden by 1.2 points.

Incumbent Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, who is stepping down because of term limits, defeated his GOP gubernatorial opponent Scott Wagner by 17 points in 2018, a Democratic wave year, and unseated GOP Gov. Tom Corbett by nearly 10 points in 2014, a Republican wave year.

The money race

Shapiro has vastly outraised and outspent Mastriano. According to the Associated Press, Shapiro has spent more than $44 million, and has $11 million still in the bank, while Mastriano has spent less than $3 million, and has $2.6 million left to spend, as of late September.

What experts say

The race between Mastriano and Shapiro is rated as ""lean Democratic"" by Inside Elections and ""likely Democratic"" by The Cook Political Report and Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11430295/Twitter-staff-likening-Elon-Musk-Harry-Potter-villain-Voldemort.html,Twitter staff are likening Elon Musk to Harry Potter villain Voldemort,"Staff at Twitter are likening Elon Musk to Voldemort from the Harry Potter franchise because they dare not mention his name.

Employees at the social network have avoided using their new owner's name on messaging service Slack, DailyMail.com can reveal.

They fear that Musk's 'goons' from Tesla who he brought with him to Twitter will scan for mentions of 'Musk' and 'Elon' to find people being rude to him.

Already Mush has fired at least a dozen workers who criticized him on Slack.

As a result Musk has been likened to 'He Who Must Not Be Named', or Voldemort, the villain from Harry Potter.

The claim comes from a current employee at Twitter who branded Musk 'callous' and 'not able to put on a human face'.

It starkly shows the breakdown in trust between Musk and the 3,500 employees who remain after he fired half of company. He has also axed some 4,400 contract workers cutting the number left to just over 1,000.

Musk is now claiming Twitter could go bankrupt as it is losing $4million a day

Since Musk completed his $44billion acquisition of Twitter last month he has shaken up the company as he tries to find new ways to make money.

But it has been a rocky ride and he botched the rollout of a new $8 verification service, mocked a US Senator who criticized him and has attracted criticism from the FTC, the telecoms regulator.

Advertisers including Lockheed Martin have paused their advertising spending on Twitter while brands such as Pepsi have been shocked at the proliferation of fake accounts which have fooled consumers.

Musk is now claiming Twitter could go bankrupt as it is losing $4million a day.

According to the Twitter employee the 'only rational explanation' for Musk's actions is that he is 'an incompetent executive who is way out of his comfort zone.'

The employee said that the mood among Twitter staff is grim and that they are getting their news about their employment status from the media, rather than their own managers.

There has been a '360 degree' change in culture from slow and incremental and respecting staff time off to Musk demanding that everyone work in the office at least 40 hours a week – with staff sleeping at their desks to meet impossible deadlines.

For many Twitter staff it seems like Musk is trying to give Twitter an 'electroshock' to make it like Tesla and SpaceX, his hard-charging companies made in his own image from the ground up.

But Musk's bullheaded approach doesn't work with Twitter, which is fundamentally different from his other ventures.

The employee said: 'Musk doesn't understand that this is an advertising business and how valuable relationships are in the industry.

'He fired the executives who have strong relationships with the advertising world. It's not really clear how we come back from that.'

The majority of people who were not fired are now looking for the exit at Twitter, a place they had been proud to call their employer because it was so transparent, said the source.

And managers are refusing to tell staff anything.

A current employee said they fear that Musk's 'goons' will scan for mentions of 'Musk' and 'Elon' to find people being rude about their new boss. They are branding Musk as 'callous' and 'not able to put on a human face'

'It's like he's Voldemort or He Who Shall Not Be Named. Instead people are calling him ''the guy at the top'' or 'new ownership' so that if the goons search the chats for 'Elon' or 'Musk' nothing will come up,' the employee said

The employee said: 'The layoffs could have been done in a compassionate way but they weren't. It was callous.

'As people were being laid off Musk was tweeting about how he didn't like small talk. It's like he's not able to put on a human face.

'In the past that would have been telegraphed for months by HR. Instead we found out in an email.

'It doesn't make sense. We are all wondering how the heck has he got Tesla to be such a success?'

Among those who were fired was an employee who was eight months pregnant, but those who are on work visas tied to the company are especially vulnerable too.

They are now 'scrambling' for legal help because they are not sure if the 60 day period before they have to leave the US starts when they were fired, or when their last day is.

Others who 'want to quit can't because of their visa,' according to the employee.

Since Musk completed his $44billion acquisition of Twitter last month he has shaken up the company as he tries to find new ways to make money

Eli Lilly saw $15billion worth of capital wiped after a fake account with an official check mark tweeted: 'We are excited to announce insulin is now free'

Lockheed Martin saw shares plummet last week when an impersonation account tweeted: 'We will begin halting all weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, Israel and the United States until further investigation into their record of human rights abuses. #WeAreLM'

An account claiming to be PepsiCo tweeted out: 'Coke is better'

While some managers are 'sucking up' to the new regime, most people are trying to stay out of trouble until they can move on.

The employee said: 'People are not using the words Elon or Musk in the Twitter Slack chats because they are worried that his goons – that what people are calling his friends from Tesla who have come over to Twitter – will see it.

'It's like he's Voldemort or He Who Must Not Be Named. Instead people are calling him ''the guy at the top'' or 'new ownership' so that if the goons search the chats for 'Elon' or 'Musk' nothing will come up'.

Such is the confusion that one employee who Musk tweeted had been fired didn't even know he had been let go, according to a Slack conversation seen by DailyMail.com.

Musk has told staff that he has 'PTSD' about previous recessions which is why he is cutting costs so much – as another is expected next year.

Among those fired have been Parag Agrawal, Twitter's chief executive, and Ned Segal, the chief financial officer, who were let go the day after Musk took over.

Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's top legal and policy executive, and Sean Edgett, the general counsel, were also dismissed.

Among those fired have been chief executive Parag Agrawal, top legal and policy excutive Vijaya Gadde, and Sean Edgett, the general counsel

Elon Musk appeared to fire a Twitter developer in a tweet on Monday after the employee contradicted him online

According to the New York Times, Musk wanted an audit of staff because he feared there were 'ghost employees' who were being paid but were not actually doing the job.

One engineering manager who was told to fire hundreds of his staff threw up in a trash can.

Among the others who have departed have been Yoel Roth, the respected head of Safety and Integrity at Twitter.

When he and other top safety executives quit it triggered a rare comment from the FTC that it was 'tracking the developments at Twitter with deep concern.'

Soon after, Musk got into a spat on Twitter with Senator Ed Markey, the powerful Democrat, when Musk ridiculed his Twitter account and said it 'sounds like a parody'.

Markey responded by Tweeting: 'Fix your companies. Or Congress will'.

""I feel like I did 18 years ago. It still hurts,"" his daughter Lakia said. ""And I feel like somebody should be held accountable.""

Whitehead was an R&B star born and raised in Philadelphia. He and partner Gene McFadden wrote songs for the O'Jays and Harold Melvin on the Philadelphia International Records before dreaming up the monster hit, ""Ain't No Stopping Us Now.""

In 2004, witnesses say Whitehead was ambushed by three shooters while working on his car behind his West Oak Lane home. It's been nearly 20 years, and still no one has been charged with his death.

""It's not like I'm around feeling like, 'Oh we're going to find out who did this!' It's eighteen years later, but I still have hope.,"" Laika said. ""I still have hope.""

Ron Kind, flipping the seat to Republicans for the first time in a quarter century.

What You Need To Know Wisconsin's third congressional district voted twice for Donald Trump



Analysts predicted the race would be an easy pick up seat for Republicans following the retirement of longtime Democratic incumbent Rep. Ron Kind



Derrick Van Orden, a former NAVY seal who attended the January 6th “Stop the Steal” rally outside Congress narrowly beat Democratic state senator Brad Pfaff by 3.6 percentage points



Pfaff says he's eyeing a 2024 run but has not decided if it would be for re-election to the state legislature or another run for the House of Representatives

Retiring Democrat Rep. Ron Kind held the seat for nearly 25 years. But analysts predicted the seat would flip because it has increasingly shifted more to the right.

The western Wisconsin district, which include La Crosse, Eau Claire and Stevens Point, are made up of many of the rural white voters who have migrated to the Republican Party.

Voters there also twice voted for Donald Trump. The Cook Political Report ranked it ""Likely Republican"" in its House race analysis.

While Van Orden, a former NAVY seal who attended the January 6th “Stop the Steal” rally outside Congress, did beat Democratic state senator Pfaff, it was by a narrow margin of around 12,000 votes.

Helen Kalla, the spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told Spectrum News that “Democrats defied the odds in Wisconsin’s 3rd District despite pollsters’ predictions, it would be a Republican blowout.”

""We were proud to support Brad Pfaff, whose strong message against extremism closed the gap in this very competitive district,” Kalla added.

Pfaff said he always knew it would be close.

“There's a lot of Democrats here in rural western and central Wisconsin,” Pfaff told Spectrum News.

What wasn’t close was the amount of money fueling the campaigns. Van Orden significantly out-raised Pfaff by millions of dollars and according to FEC filings, the National Republican Congressional Campaign (NRCC) outspent the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) on the race as well. The NRCC spent more than $365,000 on Van Orden while the DCCC put $75,000 into Pfaff’s campaign.

""With a little bit greater investment from national Democrats, we would have held this seat,"" Pfaff told Spectrum News. “I wish [conversations with national Democrats] would have been a little bit more expansive. I wish those conversation would have been a more of a give and take.”

Again, rural voters make up a significant portion Wisconsin’s third congressional district. It’s a voting bloc that Democrats have struggled to reach in state, local, and federal elections. While President Joe Biden’s campaign gained support among suburban voters during the 2020 election, support for former President Donald Trump grew among rural voters, according to the Pew Research Center.

“I know this district and I fit this district well,” Pfaff said. “And for all of those national Democrats that have been fretting for all these years, that as a party, they don't do very well in rural America, well, they had a real opportunity to do well in rural America.”

Outgoing Rep. Kind, said Pfaff was a ""good candidate"" despite his loss, calling him a local who ""knows the challenges"" in the district very well.

“This seat is going to very much be competitive in the future if we have the right candidate,” Kind told Spectrum News. “And Brad certainly, in my opinion, would have made a terrific representative.”

Pfaff says he's eyeing a 2024 run but has not decided if it would be for re-election to the state legislature or another run for the House of Representatives.

""But I agree with Congressman Kind,"" he added. ""This seat is very winnable.”",Q4

5. The end of Mike Jackson's UFC run?

LAS VEGAS, NEVADA – OCTOBER 15: (L-R) Mike Jackson punches Pete Rodriguez in a welterweight fight during the UFC Fight Night event at UFC APEX on October 15, 2022 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC)

It’s boggles the mind to see [autotag]Mike Jackson[/autotag] has been part of the UFC roster for more than six years dating back to when he was signed to fight Mickey Gall in the CM Punk sweepstakes.

Jackson lost that fight, but ended up keeping his place in the organization long enough to eventually get the matchup with the professional wrestling standout. Then he stuck around to get another fight against Dean Barry in April, which he won by unforeseen disqualification.

Fast forward to Saturday, and Jackson (1-2 MMA, 1-2 UFC) once again showed up for the opening fight of the card against Pete Rodriguez. But unfortunately for him, there were no second chances, lucky breaks of bizarre fight endings. He was outclassed by a significantly better fighter, and the end result was a highlight-reel knockout loss.

If the UFC didn’t go into the CM Punk business, Jackson would’ve never had a single octagon appearance. Somehow he reached four, but you have to believe this is the end of the line. Although I don’t know for a fact, I assume Jackson was brought on a relatively standard four-fight UFC contract. This would mark the end of that, and I can’t think of a single reason why he would be signed to another deal.

Jackson is actually a super nice guy and a part of the MMA media as a photographer and occasional writer. He made the most out of his opportunity, so no one can hate that. But to be brutally honest, there was a point in time when “UFC caliber fighter” actually meant something, and it never meant less than with him.

4. Tatsuro Taira's title potential

LAS VEGAS, NEVADA – OCTOBER 15: (L-R) Tatsuro Taira of Japan punches CJ Vergara in a flyweight fight during the UFC Fight Night event at UFC APEX on October 15, 2022 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC)

22-year-old [autotag]Tatsuro Taira[/autotag] added to his perfect record with a slick second-round submission win over CJ Vergara in their flyweight bout.

Taira (12-0 MMA, 2-0 UFC) is arguably the biggest Japanese prospect out there right now, and he keeps showing reasons why in his fights. Despite Vergara coming into the fight three pounds overweight, Taira accepted the fight without batting an eye. Then when he got in there, he threatened with submissions until he locked in a tight armbar to force the tap from his opponent.

To round out a great night for him, Taira got on the mic in his post-fight interview and declared his intentions to become the first Japanese titleholder in UFC history, and said he has no intentions of losing before that belt gets wrapped around his waist.

That would be a huge accomplishment for Taira, and as long as his career is handled wisely, it doesn’t seem unreasonable. His size, length and grappling ability is going to make him a problem for a lot of the top names at 125 pounds. If he can make his striking more dangerous, maybe his dream comes to fruition.

3. Raphael Assuncao bounces back

[autotag]Raphael Assuncao[/autotag] was one of the biggest underdogs on the card against Victor Henry, and he made everyone look foolish for putting him in that position.

Although he’s never fought for a UFC title and failed to win the “big one” on multiple occasions, Assuncao (29-8 MMA, 12-6 UFC) is one of the best bantamweights in MMA history. His resume is exceptional, but four losses in a row – no matter how great the level of competition – is going to lead to public skepticism.

Pair those losses with the fact Assuncao recently turned 40, and there was good reason to write him off. But it wasn’t valid. Assuncao did everything he needed to get back on track. He paired up with a great team at Xtreme Couture in Las Vegas, went back to his most comfortable style of counter-fighting, then shut out Henry on the scorecards over three rounds.

Assuncao said in his post-fight interview that he’s been grappling with the concept of retirement, but didn’t want to make any definitive spur-of-the-moment decisions on fight night. He said it’s coming down the pipeline sooner rather than later, though, and it’s just a matter of finding the right time.

I could see why it might be hard to walk away on the heels of that performance, but there’s also nothing like going out on a high.

2. Jonathan Martinez spoils Cub Swanson's debut

[listicle id=2588623]

All the talk going into the co-main event centered around [autotag]Cub Swanson[/autotag]’s first fight at bantamweight in more than 15 years, which seemed just fine for the soft-spoken [autotag]Jonathan Martinez[/autotag].

But when they stepped in the octagon, it was Martinez (17-4 MMA, 8-3 UFC) who made the statement. He battered fan favorite Swanson (28-13 MMA, 13-9 UFC) en route to a leg kick TKO finish in the second round to extend his winning streak to four fights.

It’s tough to see Swanson go down like that, but it’s hard not to be happy for Martinez, who is the very definition of a guy who refuses to talk trash, keeps his head down and works hard. It’s translating to positive results for him.

Getting a gauge on where Swanson goes in the aftermath of this fight is tough. He said he dropped down from featherweight for a “new challenge,” but it wasn’t the smoothest week for him judging by his word-less media day and stoppage loss. He’s not going to be able to beat the best in either division at this point in his career, and hopefully if he wants to do more fights before wrapping his career, UFC books him in the manner he deserves. He’s truly one of the great role models in the sport.

As for Martinez, his callout of Dominick Cruz may not have been likely, but it was his first sign of some edge in his UFC career. If he doesn’t get that fight, hopefully he gets someone in the upper tier because I would be intrigued to see how he’d fare and what his ceiling truly is.

1. Alexa Grasso's stance on title shot

[listicle id=2588657]

After beating Viviane Araujo by unanimous decision in her first UFC main event, [autotag]Alexa Grasso[/autotag] refused to take a bold stance on the title shot – and that’s the correct way to play things.

There’s no doubt Grasso (15-3 MMA, 7-3 UFC) belongs in the conversation to challenge women’s flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko (23-3 MMA, 12-2 UFC) after going 4-0 since moving up from strawweight.

Would this run have her in the same spot of a less stacked division, though? Probably not. Fighters at 125 pounds are automatically expedited up the pecking order due to Shevchenko’s dominance and need for new challengers. That’s why Grasso has been getting questions about a title shot for her past three fights.

Grasso isn’t allowing the pressure to demand a shot get to her, however. She gave a realistic answer post-fight in saying she really thrived with the experience of her first five-round fight, and would love another against a top-three opponent as the final step.

But Grasso also seems understanding of the reality. Shevchenko’s queue has minimal intriguing options, and with Grasso being a name with a strong following – especially in her native Mexico – she gets even more momentum. She said she would take the shot if the UFC serves it up on a silver platter, and that’s what most should do because it might never come around again, but being a bit standoffish is a good call.

Vicky White, a former Lauderdale County, Alabama, corrections official, walked Casey White out of jail on April 29, and the duo led investigators on an 11-day manhunt spanning multiple states and involving disguises and multiple cars.

The two were not related but were allegedly involved in a jailhouse romance.

Deputies in Indiana recaptured Casey White after a car chase as the alleged lovers tried to evade capture. As a U.S. Marshals-led task force approached the vehicle, Vicky White took her own life, shooting herself in the head, according to authorities. Casey White surrendered without further incident.

ALABAMA PROSECUTOR PUSHES BACK ON EX-ESCAPEE CASEY WHITE'S REQUEST FOR TRANSFER FROM PRISON TO JAIL

As a result of the jail guard's death, Lauderdale District Attorney Chris Connolly tacked on a felony murder charge for Casey White in connection with the escape attempt, which itself carries a felony charge.

""We are not seeking the death penalty in [either of his pending cases],"" Connolly told Fox News Digital Tuesday. ""This decision was made after consultation with Connie Ridgeway’s sons.""

Ridgeway is the 58-year-old Rogersville woman who White allegedly killed in 2015.

Connolly could have sought a maximum of the death penalty in the capital murder case. In Vicky White's death, in which Casey White was arraigned Tuesday, the maximum penalty if convicted would be life without parole – which the DA said he planned to seek.

Casey White was already serving a 75-year prison sentence when he was transferred from a state prison to the Lauderdale County Detention Center in Florence to stand trial nearby on unrelated murder charges in the attack on Ridgeway. Authorities say he confessed in 2020 before pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.

Austin Williams, one of Ridgeway's sons, told Fox News Digital Tuesday he is hoping for a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.

""I definitely don’t want him ever up for parole,"" he said. ""I’m glad the wheels of justice are turning.""

The Highland Park victims are among more than 3,200 Americans killed in over 600 mass shootings so far this year. Illinois communities have not been spared in recent years, with mass shootings taking place in cities that include Aurora, DeKalb, Zion, East St. Louis, Yorkville, Waukegan, Decatur, Wheeling, Rockford, Crest Hill, North Chicago, Romeoville, Elgin, Joliet and Peoria.

Hundreds of victims live in Chicago neighborhoods served by Chicago CRED, which I founded in 2016 to combat gun violence. In fact, this year alone, dozens of shootings involving four or more victims have taken place. One, on the West Side in Garfield Park in November, involved 14 people — including a 3-year-old — who were wounded during a peaceful vigil to memorialize the passing of a family member.

Our organization and our community partners have directly served more than 1,200 people in Chicago, most of whom have experienced gun violence as victims, witnesses and offenders. They have lost countless friends and family members and suffered unspeakable injuries. The level of trauma is beyond measure.

Opinion bug Opinion

We don’t have to resign ourselves to living with mass shootings. When a gunman shot 35 people in 1996 in the Australian state of Tasmania, where my wife is from, Australia passed new gun laws and instituted a massive buy-back program. They did not have a mass shooting for 20 years, while America averages roughly two a day.

When a gunman killed 50 people and wounded 50 others in New Zealand in 2019, the government quickly banned all assault weapons. What a remarkable and life-affirming gift to future generations. Imagine if we gave that gift to our children.

America is virtually alone among high-income countries for its lax gun laws because of a broken political system that enables the gun lobby to control Congress, using lies, threats and fear-mongering to convince Americans they need assault weapons — when there is simply no justification for them.

You don’t use assault weapons to hunt. You don’t need them for protection. And they are obviously not meant for target shooting. They have only one purpose — to kill or wound as many people as possible in as short a time as possible.

With fear of crime running high, it is mind-boggling that we are unable or unwilling to pass laws that will keep guns away from people who should not have them. That includes troubled young people, adults suffering from mental health issues, violent spousal abusers, and political extremists. For once, let’s put the rights of our children and families to live without fear ahead of the right to own guns that have no legitimate place in a civilized society.

No more thoughts and prayers

The Illinois proposal would not only ban assault weapons and large capacity magazines, but would also establish a federal-state partnership to stop the flow of illegal guns into Chicago from states with more lenient gun laws. In fact, 60% guns recovered by Chicago police come from outside Illinois.

The proposal also raises the age of eligibility for gun ownership from 18 to 21, an age group especially prone to gun violence. Those 18-20 are three times more likely to kill than those who are 21 and older. The proposal includes exceptions for those serving in the military and allows for guardian-supervised hunting.

Lastly, the proposal allows the state to remove guns from individuals deemed dangerous and doubles the possible length of a “firearm restraining order” from six months to a year.

I don’t ever want to hear another politician offer “thoughts and prayers” after another mass shooting. I don’t ever again want to look into the eyes of parents of dead first and second graders as I did in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 after a 20-year-old man used his mother’s assault rifle to kill 20 children and six adults. I don’t ever want to attend another funeral for a slain Chicago Public Schools student, which I did all too frequently as CEO of CPS.

Every state should finally adopt reasonable, common sense gun laws that will make it much harder for deranged individuals to slaughter innocent people.

I strongly urge the people of Illinois to join with millions of people in California, New Jersey, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts and New York as well as Washington, D.C., and push for adoption of HB 5855, the Protect Illinois Communities Act.

It is, literally, a matter of life and death.

A New Lawsuit Says This Violates the First Amendment.,"In New York, websites and apps are required to have a plan to address ""hateful conduct"" on their platforms. A new lawsuit is seeking to change that.

On Thursday, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) filed a lawsuit on behalf of two online platforms, Rumble and Locals, as well as Eugene Volokh, a UCLA law professor who runs the blog The Volokh Conspiracy (which is hosted by Reason.) FIRE claims that a New York law mandating that online platforms provide mechanisms for reporting ""hateful"" speech violates the First Amendment.

""The state of New York can't turn bloggers into Big Brother, but it's trying to do just that,"" said FIRE attorney Daniel Ortner said in a Thursday press release. ""The government can't burden online expression protected by the Constitution, whether it's doing it in the name of combating hate or any other sentiment.""

In June, Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed into law a bill, ""Social Media Networks; Hateful Conduct Prohibited,"" intended to curb online hateful speech. The law amends existing business regulations to require that broadly defined social media networks provide a mechanism for users to report instances of ""hateful conduct"" and publish a policy for how it will ""respond and address"" the reports.

The law defines ""hateful conduct"" as ""the use of a social media network to vilify, humiliate, or incite violence against a group or a class of persons on the basis of race, color, religion, ethnicity, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression."" Platforms that fail to comply with the law can face fines of up to $1,000 per day of violation.

FIRE argues that the law violates the First Amendment in four ways. First, it argues that the law compels the speech of social media platforms by requiring that they publish hate speech policies. Second, it argues the law imposes unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination by singling out speech that is ""hateful"" on the basis of several protected classes for moderation. Third, FIRE claims that the law is overly broad ""because it pressures online services to chill, prohibit, or remove a substantial amount of constitutionally protected online speech and compels them to voice the state's pro-censorship view.""

Further, FIRE argues that the law is vague and that vagueness coupled with an official statement from New York's governor insisting that the law requires companies to ""monitor and report hateful conduct"" leads platforms to ""reasonably believe that the Online Hate Speech Law will be expansively interpreted and aggressively enforced…unconstitutionally incentivizing them to chill speech on their platform and compelling them to parrot the state's message in order to avoid investigation and civil penalties.""

However, the law contains a provision that seemingly attempts to protect itself from coming under fire for violating the First Amendment, clarifying that the statute does not order social media networks to violate the ""rights or freedoms of any persons, such as exercising the right of free speech pursuant to the first amendment to the United States Constitution."" FIRE is unconvinced by the provision, arguing that the clause is far too vague.

""I don't think that that savings clause really means anything,"" Volokh tells Reason. ""Our whole point is that the statute does adversely affect my constitutional rights by mandating that I set up a policy that I don't want to set up, aimed at certain viewpoints that I don't want to have to single out in a policy.""

It appears that New York politicians want to try to force social media companies to single out large swaths of disfavored speech for monitoring—and, thus, for regulation. However, such a scheme violates the constitutional rights of platforms to decline to moderate online speech that the state disfavors.

""The First Amendment protects speech regardless of the viewpoint that it expresses,"" Volokh says, ""and the reason why it protects the speech that each of us values is precisely that it doesn't let the government say 'certain kinds of viewpoints can be suppressed.' So, if you give the government the power to suppress some viewpoints, it'll end up having the power to suppress other viewpoints, including viewpoints that you might like.""",Q4

The Skanner wishes to share this important series with our readers and the public to increase our collective knowledge of how this racist movement was allowed to flourish in this state. And to encourage dialogue about how the KKK’s history of racism is still with us in many forms today. We encourage feedback.

Oregon and the Klan: Guest Column

Former Portland Tribune reporter and editor Steve Law (Courtesy Photo: Steve Law)America First. Stolen election. The Big Lie.

Bashing immigrants and the media. Sound familiar?

To students of history, they should be.

The tactics and rhetoric deployed by today’s Trump-centric conservative movement read like the playbook of the Ku Klux Klan a century ago, when it briefly rose to dominate Oregon politics.

“We’ve kind of been here before,” observed Jeff LaLande, who has written about the Klan and taught history at Southern Oregon University.

“Maybe the very same wine in a different bottle.”

A powerful backlash against immigrants arose a century ago across the United States. Then the targets were primarily Catholics and Jews, plus Chinese and Japanese.

Now it’s Latinos, Muslims and other people of color.

In both cases, LaLande says, many Americans grew alarmed by “immigration of people not like us.”

After World War I, Americans turned inward, wary of more foreign entanglements. When Bragg Calloway, the first Klan recruiter in Portland in the spring of 1921, he distributed flyers stating the KKK stood for “America First,” reported the Portland Telegram newspaper on June 17, 1921.

When Trump adopted that slogan, it was a tried-and-true way to stir up nationalist sentiments.

Kaspar Kubli, the Klansman who served as Portland city commissioner and then speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives, voiced a version of the racist “white replacement” trope now being espoused by neo-Nazis and Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson.

In 1920, Kubli warned that California by 1950 might be “equally composed of Japs and whites unless radical measures were taken,” reported Oregon Voter magazine at the time. Kubli spoke of fears the same thing could occur in Oregon, wrote historian E. Kimbark MacColl in his Portland history “Growth of a City.”

“Why postpone action?” Kubli asked.

In the 1922 elections, the entire Multnomah County Republican delegation to the Oregon Legislature had Klan backing, according to David Horowitz, a Portland State University history professor who has written extensively about the Klan.

“The claims that native-born white Americans had become outsiders in their own land made these political alliances morally respectable,” Horowitz wrote.

Pandemics and vaccinations

President Donald Trump blamed China for the Covid-19 virus and called it “kung flu,” deftly deflecting blame for his own mismanagement of the pandemic here.

A century earlier, many Americans blamed Spain for the deadly 1918-20 flu epidemic, calling it the Spanish flu. In reality, many scientists believe that virus originated in Kansas, brought to Europe by U.S. soldiers fighting in World War I.

Much like today’s conservatives, a sizable group of Oregonians opposed flu vaccinations a century ago. Many of them were the same voters who helped enact the Klan’s 1922 ballot measure banning Catholic schools in Oregon, wrote Linda Gordon, in her 2017 history “The Second Coming of the KKK.”

Trump wasn’t the first politician to conjure up conspiracy theories to justify losing an election.

When Klan sympathizer Charles Hall narrowly lost the GOP nomination for Oregon governor in the 1922 primary, the Klan called it a stolen election, blaming the Catholic pope in Rome, wrote the Rev. Lawrence Saalfeld, in his 1950 master’s dissertation on the Klan in Oregon.

Nazi propagandists usually are credited with devising the Big Lie tactic, demonstrating that if you repeat a lie often enough, your supporters will believe it.

But the 1920s-era Klan, much like Trump and the allied QAnon cult a century later, freely practiced that tactic.

Klan publications charged that Jews were responsible for roughly 65,000 young girls who were disappearing each year.

“The Jews get them and sell them as white slaves,” the Klan wrote, according Gordon’s book.

Backers of the 1922 Klan initiative to ban Catholic schools in Oregon convinced many voters that Gov. Ben Olcott, who was running for reelection and opposed the measure, was Catholic.

“I believe that two-thirds of the people of Oregon, despite all we could do to offset the malicious lies told by the Klan, believed that I was a Catholic,” Olcott told fellow governors after he was unseated in November 1922.

Attacking the media

The Klan aggressively attacked the mainstream media when it didn’t like the coverage it received, much like Trump and other Republicans do today. The Klan organized an advertising boycott, against the Portland Telegram, the only Portland daily paper that provided significant watchdog coverage of the Klan’s rise here.

“Ad cancellations, threats against employees and their families, and destruction of Telegram papers and property were among the methods,” wrote Frances Paul Valenti for his 1993 master’s thesis on the role of the Portland media covering the 1920s Klan.

The Telegram quickly lost 5,000 subscribers and had to vacate its downtown Portland building, going into a tailspin from which it never recovered, Valenti wrote.

Newspapers were declining prior to Trump’s election. But his attacks and claims that reporters are “enemies of the people” surely didn’t help.

A century ago, as now, a great cultural chasm separated rural and urban America. Then cities were viewed as denizens of machine politics, alcoholism and other vices, many of them blamed on Irish Catholic immigrants, Horowitz says.

Race was a big part of the urban-rural split then as now, he says, but there’s much more going on, he says.

“I think it’s more a general anxiety about the perceived alienation that modernization entailed,” Horowitz says of the parallels to today. “Both represent elements of a white middle class that feel that society is passing them by. It’s just a lot of anxiety and anger.”

Intimidating rivals

Darrell Millner, emeritus Black Studies professor for Portland State University, sees a similar pattern of political bullying with the Klan and Trump, which both struck fear in would-be critics or rivals.

“Nobody wants to run against Trump in a Republican primary,” Millner says.

“The same was true of the Klan in the 1920s; people were afraid of the consequences.”

Millner also sees a parallel between evangelical Christians of the 1920s with today. A century ago, evangelicals who objected to the Klan’s methods and some of its views aligned with it anyway, because the Klan supported Prohibition and opposed Catholic immigration. Today the Christian right closes its eyes to Trump’s questionable morals because he opposes abortion, Millner says.

Lessons for today

After researching the Klan in Oregon, the Rev. Lawrence Saalfeld was skeptical that its demise led to genuine changes.

“Are the forces of religious, racial and other forms of prejudice ever really dead and buried — in Oregon or anywhere?” he asked in his master’s dissertation.

That was written in 1950.

Though Oregonians passed the anti-Catholic schools initiative in 1922, Horowitz found the campaign against the measure provided a model for today’s reform movements. Catholics who led the opposition built alliances with other faith leaders, he says, using “language that ordinary people can relate to.”

To bring change today, Horowitz says, “you’re going to have to rely on the kindness of strangers.”

Though the Klan briefly seized political power in Oregon a century ago, Horowitz says democracy was never really threatened then. But it is now, he says, as Republicans seek to twist election results through devious means.

Millner also seems pessimistic about the direction of our country these days.

“We seem incapable of learning from our past events, from our past history,” he laments.

Nevertheless, it’s essential to study past movements like the Klan, says LaLande, now a historical and archeological consultant in the Ashland area.

There will always be anti-democratic forces in a democracy, he says.

“I think it’s important to know that we’ve been in these places before.”

Stephen Barbee, 55, was killed by lethal injection Wednesday evening at the Texas state penitentiary in Huntsville. He was pronounced dead in Huntsville at 7:35 p.m.

All executions in Texas take place any time after 6 p.m. and all executions are carried out at the Huntsville Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.

Barbee was convicted of capital murder in the 2005 killings of 34-year-old Lisa Underwood, who was pregnant, and her son, 7-year-old Jayden, in their Fort Worth home. Their bodies were later found in a shallow grave in Denton County.

Fort Worth police have said Barbee admitted to the killings, but Barbee has since said he was coerced into the confession.

Barbee’s attorneys asked the courts to stay his execution, arguing his religious rights are being violated because the state prison system, in the wake of a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court on what spiritual advisers can do while in the execution chamber, did not create a written policy on the issue, according to an Associated Press report.

The SCOTUS blog, an official source for information on rulings and Supreme Court activity, announced Wednesday afternoon the Supreme Court rejected his request to postpone his execution. Prison officials have said Barbee’s spiritual adviser, a Salvation Army minister, will be allowed to touch his foot and leg and hold his hand while praying aloud in the execution chamber.

Investigators said that Barbee killed Underwood while believing the unborn child was his and would ruin his new marriage. DNA evidence later proved the baby wasn’t Barbee’s.

He was accused by prosecutors of suffocating Underwood and then doing the same to Jayden when Jayden heard the attack and walked in on it.

When detectives first brought him in for questioning, Barbee said he hadn’t seen Underwood for months. But when he went to the bathroom alone with a detective, police said that he admitted to the killing. The conversation wasn’t recorded, and Barbee later said it was coerced.

An order to stay the execution last year left Underwood’s mother, Sheila, who was planning on attending the execution in 2021, questioning when she, and her family, will “finally receive justice.”

“I’ve forgiven Stephen. I really have in my heart, but there’s a difference between forgiveness and justice, and my family deserves justice,” Sheila Underwood told the Star-Telegram in 2021. “My thinking was, he watched my family take their last breath, I will watch him take his last breath.”

“The family of Rayshard Brooks is pleased to have reached a settlement with the city of Atlanta that resolves their civil case. This grieving family has been through so much during this process. Although the children of Mr. Brooks have lost their father, settling the case will undoubtedly assist them with future plans as they come of age,” the family's legal team said in a statement following the settlement, per CNN.

“While we are disappointed that prosecutors didn’t pursue a criminal case against the officers involved in Mr. Brooks’ death, we continue to hold out hope that the Dept. of Justice will intervene in this matter,” the statement continued.

The fatal incident unfolded on June 12, 2020, when Atlanta officers Garrett Rolfe and Devin Brosnan attempted to arrest Brooks, 27, for DUI in a Wendy's parking lot.

Brooks engaged in a struggle with officers, grabbed one of their Tasers, and attempted to flee the scene, according to law enforcement officials.

Police say Brooks pointed the Taser at Rolfe's head, and officers responded with shots that killed him.

Following the shooting, Rolfe was charged with 11 crimes including felony murder, aggravated assault, and more. Brosnan also faced charges of aggravated assault and violation of oath of office.

In August, Georgia special prosecutor Pete Skandalakis announced that the officers' charges were being dismissed, citing that their use of force was reasonable.

The fatal police shooting, which occurred less than three weeks after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, sparked protests across Atlanta and beyond amid the nation's racial reckoning.

When dropping the charges against the officers involved in Brooks' death, Skandalakis said he didn't believe the shooting was race-motivated. The nation's racial reckoning and protests against police brutality in the summer of 2020 led to a strong reaction to Brooks' death, the prosecutor said.

“This is not a case in which an officer was kneeling on a prone suspect for nine minutes, nor was it like the Ahmaud Arbery case, where armed citizens were chasing a young man through a neighborhood,” Skandalakis previously said.

The head of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill said on October 7, 2022 that Vladimir Putin's reign over Russia had been mandated by God, congratulating the Kremlin chief on his 70th birthday. Alexander NEMENOV / AFP

The same day, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to three human rights organisations and activists: Ales Bialiatski of Belarus, Russia's Memorial group and Ukraine's Center for Civil Liberties.





The committee said it wanted the prize to highlight the ""way civil society and human rights advocates are being suppressed"" in Russia.





In Russia, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill said that Putin's reign over Russia had been mandated by God.





""God put you in power so that you could perform a service of special importance and of great responsibility for the fate of the country and the people entrusted to your care,"" the patriarch said, joining a chorus of Russian officials congratulating Putin on his birthday.





The Patriarch praised Putin for ""transforming the image of Russia, strengthening its sovereignty and its defence capability, protecting its national interests.""





Kirill wished ""health and a long life"" to the Russian leader, who has been in power for more than 20 years.





He also called on worshippers across the country to pray for Putin's health.





""You gained the reputation of a national leader selflessly devoted to the Fatherland, sincerely loving the Motherland and giving all its strength to it,"" the Patriarch said.





The leader of the Russian Orthodox Church since 2009, Kirill has been a vocal supporter of the military operation in Ukraine.





Kirill has close ties with Putin's government, backing conservative values over Western liberalism.



- 'If there is Putin, there is Russia' -



Close Putin ally, Belarus strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko, told journalists he gifted a Belarusian tractor ""the best one out there"" to the Russian president.





Lukashenko was in Putin's hometown, Saint Petersburg, for a meeting with the Kremlin chief and leaders of ex-Soviet countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).





He said the tractor could be used to sow wheat so that Europeans ""do not starve or steal bread from Ukraine"".





The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, two of the world's biggest grain exporters, had disrupted exports, raising fears of a global food crisis.





Putin received a flurry of birthday messages, including from Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov who wished ""good health, long life and successes"" to the Russian president in a video statement mixed with archive footage and emotional music.





""Putin has changed the position of Russia in the world and made it a nation to be reckoned with!"" Kadyrov said.





The speaker of the Russian parliament Vyacheslav Volodin said on Telegram: ""if there is Putin, there is Russia.""





Around 40 people from 20 different ethnic groups making up Russia took part in a flash mob near the Kremlin, according to state-run news agency TASS.





Putin was also praised by officials installed by Moscow in the Ukrainian regions it partially controls and claims to have annexed.





Kremlin-backed leader of Zaporizhzhia region Yevgeny Balitsky said on Telegram that ""thanks to Vladimir Vladimirovich and the people of Russia, the Zaporizhzhia region became part of the great country, reunited with its family.""





His counterpart in the Donetsk region Denis Pushilin said ""for the residents of Donbas, the name of the leader of our country is forever associated with the most important event in recent history -- the return home.""





Seven months into the Ukraine offensive, Putin is isolated from Western countries and has been looking east in the face of unprecedented sanctions.





The Kremlin has not reported any messages of congratulations received from Washington or Brussels.





Friday is also the anniversary of the murder of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who was shot dead on October 7, 2006.

“The story of Chanukah is a story of victory of light over darkness,"" Erdan said at the event. ""Our enemies tried to erase our Jewish identity but we refused to surrender and let them win. With faith and determination, the few defeated many. The World's Largest Menorah is set up by Chabad-Lubavitch in New York City ahead of Hanukkah, on December 15, 2022. (credit: CHABAD)

“Today in a time when antisemitism is on the rise, we are once again fighting the darkness and fighting for our religion and culture. But this time, we are not fighting alone. Here with us is my dear friend, Mayor Adams.” UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan

""Since then, every year, we light the Chanukah candles by our windows and in public places like here on Fifth Avenue to publicize the miracle and to show the world that we are proud to be Jews and we are not afraid to show it,"" Erdan continued.

""But friends, today in a time when antisemitism is on the rise, we are once again fighting the darkness and fighting for our religion and culture. But this time, we are not fighting alone. Here with us is my dear friend, Mayor Adams. I want to thank you on behalf of the State of Israel and the Jewish people for standing with us as the Mayor in the city with the most Jews in the world. In the hardest of times, our communities have stood by one another in the face of oppression and racism. And now our communities’ age-old covenant must be reforged. When we are united, evil cannot prevail. And evil will not prevail. As the Rebbe taught us, a little bit of light can dispel much darkness,"" he continued.

""As I light the menorah, symbolizing the miracles in our history, we pray to God to continue to see miracles today, and in our future.”

Every Hanukkah, the 36-foot menorah —certified by the Guinness World Records as the world’s largest—set up by Chabad, sits at Grand Army Plaza on Fifth Avenue and 59th Street near Central Park, just outside the Plaza Hotel, lighting up the city. Since its inception, a number of notable luminaries and dignitaries have had the honor of lighting the candles of the towering symbol of the Jewish festival of lights, including several New York mayors, governors, senators and more.

The annual New York City tradition is part of the worldwide Hanukkah campaign, an initiative launched in 1973 by the Lubavitch Rebbe—Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson. The campaign focuses on creating awareness and promoting observance of the holiday. A menorah lighting has taken place at the location at Grand Army Plaza since 1977.

125% increase in NYC antisemitic hate crimes in November

The lighting ceremony took place as antisemitic hate crimes across New York City's five boroughs more than doubled last month from a year ago, New York Police Department (NYPD) data revealed. The concerning rise unfolded against a backdrop of high-profile figures making headlines for remarks targeting Jews.

There were 45 hate crimes motivated by antisemitism in November versus 20 in November 2021, according to the NYPD data. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now

Last week, federal, state and city leaders gathered to discuss the surge of antisemitism, at a forum hosted by the Orthodox Union in Manhattan. During the meeting, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced the initiation of a new statewide task force to combat antisemitism.

The event at Lincoln Square Synagogue on the Upper West Side focused on combating hate and enhancing security in Jewish communities. Adams, along with Senate Majority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer and US Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, condemned the rise of antisemitic attacks.

Adams, a former New York Police Department captain, said, “I did not spend 22 years of my life as a member of the NYPD protecting the people of this city to surrender to those who believe hate is going to have a foothold in this city. It will not happen.""",Q4
https://www.wvpublic.org/health-science/2022-12-22/omnibus-bill-to-establish-cdc-office-of-rural-health,Omnibus Bill To Establish CDC Office Of Rural Health - West Virginia Public Broadcasting,"The Federal 2023 Omnibus Appropriations Bill includes $5 million to establish an Office of Rural Health (ORH) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

A. Toni Young is the Executive Director of the Community Education Group (CEG) and a long-time advocate for vulnerable and at-risk communities, including advocacy for the establishment of the rural health office. .She works alongside lawmakers to combat public health crises, including HIV/AIDS, substance use disorder and opioid addiction and more.

“If we can get this office, then there’s a continuum of care for rural communities,” Young said. “So, from the prevention to thinking about it for prevention and planning at CDC, to the implementation and response that would happen at HRSA (Health Resources and Services Administration) in an office on Rural Health Policy, and if we can have that level of coordination, I think we can have a more robust response to the health needs of folks in rural communities, particularly in the Appalachian region.”

While the 2023 appropriations bill is still being deliberated by Congress, the establishment of the Office of Rural Health at the CDC is not being contested.

“Our focus is certainly to say, ‘We need you to see the folks of Appalachia and we need you to respond to the folks of Appalachia,” Young said. “So again, this is like a big picture saying, if we can put this piece of the puzzle together, then we can go back and say we now need you to develop a robust and coordinated plan for the health needs of the people of the Appalachian region.”

The ORH will enhance the implementation of CDC’s rural health portfolio, coordinate efforts across programs, and develop a strategic plan for rural health. The agreement also encourages ORH to accelerate innovation, make scientific and communication resources tailored to current rural public health needs, build and improve public health functions and service delivery and provide leadership in matters of public health infrastructure.

“Rural communities have been devastated by COVID-19 and other health disparities, and this new CDC office will be critical to increasing resources and raising awareness of rural Americans’ needs,” Young said. “One of the things that I think is really important for people to understand, is the role that Senators Manchin and Capito have played in this response. They too, they’ve asked the CDC, about West Virginia being included in ending the HIV epidemic. They’ve been supportive of this request for the CDC to get this Office of Rural Health.”",Q4

Former UA graduate student Murad Dervish, 46, is charged with first-degree murder in the Oct. 5 shooting death of Thomas Meixner, UA's hydrology and aquatic sciences department head. Meixner was walking from a class to his office.

A Pima County Superior Court judge denied Dervish bond during a Thursday hearing, according to Pima County Attorney's Office spokesperson CT Revere.

Dervish also is charged with aggravated assault, burglary, misconduct involving weapons and three counts of endangerment, according to court records. Another person was also injured by a bullet fragment in the shooting, according to previous reporting by The Arizona Republic.

Police said at the time that Dervish had made threats against staff. He was taken into custody some hours after the shooting.

Police said Dervish told them, “I hope he’s OK, probably wishful thinking,"" and that he felt ""so disrespected by that whole department,” according to court documents.

On Monday, UA President Robert C. Robbins penned a letter to students and faculty saying that prior to the shooting, university police filed two complaints pursuing charges against Dervish for communication with a staff member and for alleged harassment of faculty. The County Attorney's Office did not pursue charges, Robbins said in the letter.

In response, County Attorney Laura Conover said in a statement that charges, specifically on threatening and intimidation, were not filed because the complaints lacked evidence under state law.

Dervish was expelled in June, according to Robbins' letter.

The defendant's next court date for a case management hearing is set for Nov. 17, Revere said.

https://www.grandforksherald.com/news/north-dakota/pre-write-abortion-ban-takes-effect-in-north-dakota-after-judges-reversal,Bismarck judge maintains block on North Dakota abortion ban,"BISMARCK — A Bismarck judge doubled down on a decision to temporarily bar North Dakota’s abortion ban from taking effect after the state Supreme Court asked him to reconsider.

Burleigh County District Judge Bruce Romanick on Monday, Oct. 31, upheld his previous ruling to block the abortion ban while a legal battle continues between North Dakota officials and the Red River Women’s Clinic, which recently moved from Fargo to Moorhead, just across the Minnesota border.

ADVERTISEMENT

The state Supreme Court asked Romanick to reconsider the temporary injunction on the abortion ban earlier this month, saying the judge failed to consider the state’s likelihood of winning the lawsuit when deciding to block the so-called trigger law.

Romanick wrote in a Monday filing that the Supreme Court has not previously determined whether North Dakotans have a constitutional right to an abortion.

""Whether the North Dakota Constitution conveys a fundamental right to an abortion is an issue that is very much alive and active,"" Romanick wrote. ""This issue does not have a clear and obvious answer. Therefore, the Court finds that (the Red River Women's Clinic) has a substantial probability of succeeding on the merits through showing that there is a 'real and substantial question' before the Court.""

Republican Attorney General Drew Wrigley said the state's lawyers are ""unpersuaded"" by Romanick's analysis, adding the judge's logic is ""unsupported by precedent.""

Wrigley said Romanick's continued upholding of the injunction ""calls into question what his purpose is here.""

North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley speaks at a press conference in Fargo in September 2022. David Samson/The Forum

North Dakota lawmakers passed a bipartisan bill in 2007 that would outlaw abortion in the state within 30 days if the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. The high court’s Dobbs v. Jackson ruling in June triggered the 15-year-old legislation.

The clinic, which was North Dakota's lone abortion provider, sued the state in July after Wrigley set off a 30-day countdown by certifying the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision.

ADVERTISEMENT

In the months that followed, Romanick twice blocked the trigger law a day before it was due to take effect, saying Wrigley's certification was premature. Wrigley has said he acted according to the law.

If the 2007 state law takes effect, it would make performing an abortion a Class C felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. A pregnant woman cannot be penalized for performing an abortion on herself.

Abortions would still be permitted if the mother's life is in danger and in cases of rape or incest, though a medical provider may still have to prove in court the procedure was justified.

Tammi Kromenaker, director of the Red River Women's Clinic, on June 24, 2022. Chris Flynn/The Forum

Tammi Kromenaker, the director of the women's clinic, applauded Romanick's decision on Monday, calling it ""a positive step."" Kromenaker noted that keeping abortion legal allows medical providers to care for pregnant patients without wading through the ambiguity that the trigger law would bring.

Forum News Service reported Monday morning that anti-abortion lawmakers and advocates are working with representatives of North Dakota’s medical field on legislation to reconcile differences in state law that some doctors say could hinder care for patients with pregnancy complications.

The state Supreme Court will decide how the case proceeds after Monday, though it appears likely the lawsuit will end up back in Romanick's court. Romanick's final ruling in the case could eventually be appealed to the Supreme Court by the losing party.

At least 13 states, including South Dakota, have already banned most abortions. Courts have blocked abortion bans from taking effect in a handful of other states, including Montana.

While Higgins was being arrested, Harvey arrived in her Jeep and reportedly began assaulting Higgins, as well the officers. Harvey was also arrested, and police later learned the two women are sisters. ""This incident involved an argument between two female family members known to each other,"" Warren police Commissioner Bill Dwyer said.

Both women were arraigned yesterday (November 17) in 37th District Court, according to MLive. Higgins is charged with third-degree fleeing and eluding, resisting and obstructing police, and domestic violence. Harvey is charged with resisting and obstructing police and domestic violence.

And Other Cases the Supreme Court Will Take Up This Year.,"The Supreme Court’s 2014-2015 term officially begins next Monday. On Thursday, the justices added eleven cases to their docket. Here are the noteworthy additions:

EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores: Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, employers may not discriminate based on race, color, religion or national origin in the hiring or firing of employees. Thus, employers must reasonably accommodate the religious practices of their employees or prospective employees, unless such an accommodation would cause an “undue hardship.” The EEOC filed suit against Abercrombie for refusing to hire a Muslim teenager who applied to be a model because wearing a hijab conflicted with the store’s style guidelines for their models. The issue before the Supreme Court is whether Abercrombie is liable under Title VII only if it received explicit notice from the job applicant that their style guidelines conflicted with her religious beliefs.

Ohio v. Clark: The Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause requires that a criminal defendant has the right to “be confronted with the witnesses against him.” In every state, teachers have a legal obligation to report suspected child abuse to the authorities. Are any statements made by a child to a teacher considered “testimonial,” making them subject to the Confrontation Clause at trial? In this case, the trial court determined that the child victim could not testify and admitted evidence of the child’s statements to his teacher, but an appellate court reversed, finding this violated the defendant’s constitutional rights. This presents the Supreme Court with an opportunity to further define the contours of the Confrontation Clause.

Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. The Inclusive Communities Project: The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing and authorizes individuals to sue governmental entities to challenge racially discriminatory housing policies. But does this extend to claims based on a statistical showing (known as “disparate impact”) that minorities suffer disproportionately from certain policies rather than proof of actual intentional discrimination? The text of the Fair Housing Act does not authorize disparate impact claims, and the Supreme Court has never recognized such claims under the act. This is the third time the Supreme Court has granted review on this issue, but the last two cases settled out of court before the justices could issue an opinion.

Williams-Yulee v. The Florida Bar: Judges are selected by popular vote in thirty-nine states. Florida’s Code of Judicial Conduct bars judicial candidates from personally soliciting campaign contributions. Lanell Williams-Yulee, a candidate for County Court Judge in Hillsborough County, Florida, was sanctioned and fined by the Florida Supreme Court for seeking campaign contributions. She challenged this provision of the Code of Judicial Conduct as an unconstitutional “content- and speaker-based restriction on political speech,” in violation of the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause.

The Court did not announce whether it will hear one of the seven petitions involving traditional marriage laws, and it also delayed making a decision about whether to review Arizona State Legislature v.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/999446-election-time,Election time,"The Election Commission of Pakistan has stuck to its schedule and announced that local bodies elections in Karachi and by-polls for national and provincial assemblies will take place on the dates earlier announced, apart from NA-45 in Kurram owing to the law and order situation. The date for local government elections in Karachi is set for October 23 and by-elections for eight National Assembly and three provincial assembly seats for October 16. Of the eight National Assembly constituencies up for grabs, three are in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, three in Punjab, and two in Sindh (Karachi). For provincial assembly seats, all three by-elections will be held in Punjab. Since all these areas were not directly affected by any floods, there was no plausible reason for any postponement and Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja took the right step by reiterating his stance in this matter. Peaceful and timely holding of elections is a paramount responsibility of the ECP – of course with the help of law enforcement and local administrations.

It is satisfying to know that the ECP has completed all its arrangements for the upcoming elections and the wherewithal is ready to be deployed. Even the federal government had sent a letter from the interior ministry last week requesting the ECP to put off the by-polls for 90 days due to security institutions and provincial administrations being busy in rehabilitation and relief operations after the floods. The interior ministry’s stance was that the holding of elections after the floods would place a strain on the capacity of the security institutions and could put the credibility of the by-polls in question. The federal government had also referred to the possibility of the PTI holding its long march to Islamabad precisely during the week the by-elections are scheduled. Similarly, the Sindh government had also requested the ECP to put off local government elections in Karachi for three months. Now it is only with unconditional and prompt support from the government and law enforcement that a peaceful environment will prevail on the day of the scheduled polls.

Since in KP and Punjab the PTI is in power, there are clear apprehensions about the conduct of the by-elections there. The PTI and its leader Imran Khan have time and again cast aspersions on the integrity of the ECP, leading to an uncertain atmosphere in both provinces. Voters will need a peaceful environment on polling day and any disturbances or inability of the provincial governments to offer full support to the ECP may result in untoward incidents that will not be good for the electoral process in the country. In Karachi the situation is likely to be different as the government of Sindh has not raised any questions about the ECP and its chief. But there the situation is slightly different for the local bodies elections that the Sindh government was not keen on holding for various reasons. Holding of elections is a constitutional requirement and holding of local bodies elections is imperative in a state that calls itself a democracy – devolution of powers being an essential component of good governance. Flood relief and rehabilitation is the responsibility of an entirely different machinery that is not directly involved in the election exercise. The local bodies elections in Sindh have been long overdue and it is imperative that Karachi has an elected local administration as early as possible.",Q4

https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/familys-soul-being-ripped-elkhart-193929752.html,'The family's soul was being ripped from me;' Elkhart arsonist given maximum sentence,"ELKHART — Witnesses in an Elkhart County courtroom Monday spoke of the fear that permeated the farming community as the list of barn fires in Elkhart, Kosciusko and St. Joseph counties mounted in late 2021.

“This area has a long history of trust, and that keeps the community strong,"" Nelson Martin recalled. ""That feeling of trust was severely tested when we kept hearing of this word: arson. That feeling of mistrust and fear was setting into the hearts of our community.""

On Sept. 18, 2021, Martin's fears became reality as his family became one of eight in Elkhart County to see parts of their homestead engulfed in flames. Martin lost a full storage unit on his farm, including all the hay and other materials inside it, in addition to another being badly damaged.

In court Monday, Martin said he has forgiven the man responsible for the arsons — 42-year-old Joseph Hershberger — though others were less kind, saying Hershberger was a ""dangerous, evil person"" and ""cowardly"" for destroying the barns — which are viewed as the heart of any farm.

""Watching the barn burn in the middle of the night felt like my soul, heart and spirit, and the family's soul, was being ripped from me and us,"" said Garry Weybright, whose 120-year-old barn was destroyed in Oct. 2021.

Ultimately, Elkhart Superior Court judge Stephen Bowers cited the extreme financial and emotional damage inflicted, the repeated nature of the conduct and the age of some of the victims in giving Hershberger the maximum possible sentence of 96 years.

""In my time on the bench, which is approaching 16 years now, I very rarely have given the maximum sentence. I understand under Indiana law maximum sentences are reserved for the worst of the worst. Mr. Hershberger, that’s you,"" Bowers said.

Due to the terms of a plea agreement reached last month, Hershberger's prison term will only be 50 years after admitting to the crimes. Hershberger said he was sorry for his actions and that he has struggled with mental health issues for most of the past few years.

""My life hangs in the balance,"" Hershberger said. ""I apologize deeply to everyone. To my family, to all the victims, I’m sorry. I wish I had never done it. I can’t go back and fix it. I can’t rewind it.""

Arson spree

Farmers and police first were first alerted to the possibility of arson in the spring of 2021 after witnessing a series of fires at barns in the northern part of Kosciusko County and the southern part of Elkhart County.

In April, a nearly 100-year-old barn was destroyed near Milford in Kosciusko County. In May, officials investigated two fires within a couple of miles of each other just northwest of Wakarusa. Two barn fires in one night a few miles apart in June also drew the attention of law enforcement. On Sept. 18, fires at barns just a few miles apart near Goshen kept firefighters with the Harrison Township Fire Department working all night to fight the blazes.

“It’s pretty obvious, we suspect foul play,” Martin told reporters at the time when interviewed as he cleaned up from the fire damage.

Fire crews responded to two more fires in one night in early October and Elkhart county police announced they were investigating the eight barn fires in the county for arson in partnership with the Indiana State Fire Marshal.

Hershberger was arrested in December and charged with eight counts of arson in connection to the fires set in Elkhart County. Court documents in the case show that investigators were first pointed in Hershberger's direction by conducting a search for cell phones that were in the vicinity of the fires. The data allegedly showed one phone, belonging to Hershberger's partner, Sherry Thomas, was in the area of multiple fires before the blazes were seen and police questioned the pair.

When questioned by detectives, Hershberger admitted to starting several fires in Elkhart County, saying that he and Thomas would take turns pouring gasoline and setting the barns on fire, according to documents.

Additional cases

Though Hershberger was given a 50-year-sentence this week, he still has pending arson charges out of Marshall and Kosciusko counties for additional fires he allegedly set with Thomas there. The Kosciuszko County charges were filed last week, but are based on information gathered by Elkhart County detectives in the previous case.

Thomas has been charged with the same offenses as Hershberger in each case; however she appears to be nearing a plea deal with Elkhart County prosecutors that is more lenient. Thomas' plea deal, which has been filed in court but not yet accepted by a judge, would see her admit to one count of arson with the sentence being served through community corrections.

Eight journalists were murdered or killed in 2022, victims of violence in Haiti, a country facing a severe security crisis stemming from the actions of armed gangs, anti-government protests, and the excessive use of police force.

This statement was originally published on en.sipiapa.org on 13 November 2022.

Eight of their colleagues have been killed this year

Dozens of journalists dressed in white marched on Sunday through Haiti to denounce the murder of eight of their colleagues this year and demand the country’s authorities clarify each case.

The demonstration began in Champ de Mars, in the center of Port-au-Prince, and culminated at a police station in the commune of Delmas, east of the city. On that Sunday, October 30, reporter Romelo Vilsaint died of a bullet in the head while protesting the arrest of another colleague, Robeste Dimanche, who was later released.

“We are here to denounce police brutality against journalists and to ask the police inspectorate general to follow up on the file related to the murder of journalist Romelo Vilsaint,” lawyer Arnel Rémy told the AlterPress agency, one of several local media covering the activity.

The journalists also reminded the authorities of the warning of the Colectivo de Medios en Línea (CMEL), the organizer of the march, that members of the organization would cover no press conference by the police if the institution refuses to inform the public about the results of the investigations.

The CMEL filed a complaint with the Port-au-Prince Prosecutor’s Office against the officers accused of Vilsaint’s murder last week. It was initially reported that a tear gas bomb hit him. Still, Gary Desrosiers, a police spokesman, confirmed to the Associated Press that the reporter died of a “fatal gunshot” during “an unfortunate situation.”

The following day, the police announced the opening of an investigation. The government lamented the death of the journalist, a permanent correspondent in the Haitian capital for Radio Génération 80, based in the town of Port-de-Paix, in the northwest of the country.

Eight journalists were murdered or killed in 2022, victims of violence in Haiti, a country facing a severe security crisis caused by the actions of armed gangs, anti-government protests, and the excessive use of police force.

In addition to Vilsaint, the most recent death was that of journalist Fritz Dorilas. According to local media, he died on November 5 in the Tabarre commune, northeast of Port-au-Prince, when armed individuals fired shots near his home during gang clashes.

However, the online portal Alaminute.Info reported that Dorilas, co-host of the program “The law, the law and justice” on radio Megastar, was forcibly taken from his home located in the Carradeux sector and then executed nearby as the shooting was taking place. The police have not yet confirmed the cause of death.

The deaths of Dorilas and Vilsaint are in addition to those of six other journalists: Tess Garry, Radio Lebon FM, October 24; Frantzsen Charles, FS NEWS, and Tayson Lartigue, Tijèn Jounalis, September 11; Maxihen Lazarre, Rois des Infos, February 23; Wilguens Louissaint, a contributor to various digital media, and Amady John Wesley, radio station Écoute FM, January 6, 2022.

A resolution on Haiti, approved by the Inter American Press Association (IAPA) during its 78th General Assembly in Madrid, stressed that the climate of violence and the political, economic, and security crisis in which the country is immersed keep journalists in a situation of defenselessness and high risk.

The IAPA called on the government to guarantee the preservation of freedom of expression and the free and safe exercise of journalism and urged the press organizations of the Americas to express their solidarity and support for journalists and media outlets that continue to carry out their informative mission despite the high-risk circumstances.",Q4

Sean Spicer, 51, was mocked for mixing up the anniversary of Pearl Harbor and D-Day in a remembrance post on Twitter

A former White House press secretary was mocked after he confused the anniversary of Pearl Harbor with D-Day on Twitter.

Sean Spicer, 51, tweeted in a now-deleted remembrance post on Wednesday, writing: 'Today is D-Day. It only lives in infamy if we remember and share the story of sacrifice with the next generation #DDay.'

Twitter users were quick to point out to the Harvard politics fellow that today is the anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.

D-Day, which remembers the Allies' landing in Normandy in 1944, is marked on June 6.

The Republican had correctly celebrated the holiday in June, even hitting out at President Joe Biden for not acknowledging it.

He wrote in June 2021: 'Yesterday was the anniversary of #DDay - no mention of it from the President. The @WhiteHouse @PressSec says he might get around to it.'

However, the former Navy Reserve Commander, who spent 22 years serving, quickly apologized for the mishap on Wednesday, writing: 'Sorry. Apologies.'

Sean Spicer, 51, tweeted in a now-deleted remembrance post on Wednesday: 'Today is D-Day. It only lives in infamy if we remember and share the story of sacrifice with the next generation #DDay'

He later deleted the post and said 'sorry' for his mistake

But his simple apology didn't save him from a merciless attack online, as many mocked Spicer for not knowing basic history.

'Hey @SeanSpicer, DDay was when we landed on Normandy. Today is Pearl Harbour day. You'd think someone with your voice wouldn't make basic mistakes in memory of our greatest generation,' Twitter user Randy Otto wrote.

Another user, Michael Reagan wrote: 'Sean Dday is June 6th.. This is Pearl Harbor Day..Just an FYI.'

Anthony DeRosa wrote: 'Today is not, in fact, D-Day (which is June 6).'

'Well, it's not like you were in the Navy or anything,' Vin Grieco wrote.

Another user, Caitlyn Landry wrote: 'This is…painful. Not surprising at all and believable, but painful.'

Last June, Spicer did celebrate D-Day, even criticizing the White House for failing to remember it

Many made fun of Spicer's use of 'infamy,' which means an evil act, joking his tweet would also fall under that category.

'A post which will live in infamy,' TheotherT-Rev wrote.

Eight-one years ago December 7, 2,403 service members and civilians were killed at Pearl Harbor after the Japanese attacked, which officially pulled America into World War II. More than 1,000 were injured and two battleships were also sunk at the Hawaii base.

Many mocked the former press secretary for not knowing 'basic' history and said his post was 'painful' and will 'live in infamy'

A handful of centenarian survivors of the attack on Pearl Harbor joined about 2,500 members of the public at the scene of the Japanese bombing on Wednesday to commemorate those who perished.

The audience sat quietly during a moment of silence at 7.55am, the same time the attack began on December 7, 1941.

Sailors aboard the USS Daniel Inouye stood along the rails of the guided missile destroyer while it passed both by the grassy shoreline where the ceremony was held and the USS Arizona Memorial to honor the survivors and those killed in the attack.

Ken Stevens, a 100-year-old survivor from the USS Whitney, returned the salute.

'The ever-lasting legacy of Pearl Harbor will be shared at this site for all time, as we must never forget those who came before us so that we can chart a more just and peaceful path for those who follow,' said Tom Leatherman, superintendent of the Pearl Harbor National Memorial.

https://reason.com/2022/01/02/the-lockdown-showdown/,The Lockdown Showdown,"Brewery owner Jordan Serulneck remembers feeling the pit in his stomach when he found out the state was ordering him to shut his doors—again. ""Our rent was still full price,"" recalls Serulneck, the co-owner of Seven Sirens Brewing Co. in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. ""We have a loan with a bank, and that still had to be paid.""

It was November 23, 2020, three days before Thanksgiving. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, had just ordered a snap shutdown that required bars and restaurants to close on ""Thanksgiving Eve"" to prevent gatherings that might spread COVID-19. The fact that Seven Sirens had scraped together more than $10,000 to convert an outdoor space into a heated patio ahead of the winter didn't matter; the governor's order banned both indoor and outdoor dining.

When the pandemic hit in March 2020, just a few weeks after Seven Sirens had first opened in mid-February, Serulneck complied with the state's shutdown order. The promised ""15 days to slow the spread"" turned into weeks, then longer. It wasn't until months later that any bars, restaurants, or breweries were allowed to reopen for in-person service. Then came the Thanksgiving shutdown, and then another the following month, this time banning indoor dining from December 11 until after the start of the new year.

When Wolf imposed those new shutdowns late in 2020, Serulneck wasn't the only business owner to groan—or to shrug. Hundreds of Pennsylvania businesses defied the edicts. Some were punished with fines and threatened with loss of their licenses. Serulneck recalls a TV news van that was parked outside Seven Sirens on the night before Thanksgiving ""to see if we were going to be hauled out in handcuffs"" for flouting the governor's order.

Thankfully, it didn't come to that. But Pennsylvania was hardly the only state where a governor took drastic action to curtail commercial and social activity during the pandemic—not just when it began but months after the risks of gathering and dining indoors were well known to anyone who might voluntarily visit a brewery, restaurant, or store.

Andrew Cuomo, then New York's governor, set curfews and mandated that bars sell food if they wanted to serve alcohol. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer banned stores from selling anything other than ""products necessary to maintain the safety, sanitation, and basic operations of residences."" Many states imposed sweeping mask mandates by executive order rather than through the legislative process.

Governors generally enjoy broad powers during emergencies, which allow them to command the state government in response to a terrorist attack, a hurricane, or, yes, a pandemic. But an emergency is, by definition, a discrete, time-limited event: an immediate crisis that requires an immediate response.

The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged our understanding of what counts as an emergency and when the special powers it triggers should no longer apply. Emergency powers are supposed to give governors the ability to respond quickly to unexpected circumstances. But at some point after the initial crisis has passed, doesn't an emergency transform into an issue that can be dealt with via the normal channels of government?

""If you were to use medical terminology, you'd say it goes from being an acute issue to a chronic one,"" says Meryl Justin Chertoff, executive director of the Project on State and Local Government Policy and Law at Georgetown Law School. ""When does it stop being a disaster in the sense that we need decisive executive action, and when does it start becoming something that requires the more deliberative steps of legislative action, or at least consultation between the governor and legislature?""

Many state legislatures grappled with that issue in 2021, as more than 300 measures to limit governors' unilateral emergency powers were proposed in 45 states. Such measures have been approved in at least a dozen states—including Pennsylvania, where lawmakers and the state's voters approved a pair of constitutional amendments restricting emergency powers. Those laws, in turn, have sparked opposition from governors' offices and from the public health community, which overwhelmingly backed 2020's harsh lockdowns.

These debates speak to fundamental questions about how democracies should approach not only the COVID-19 pandemic but other problems, ranging from homelessness to climate change. Does effective government require quick, centralized decisions, or should it rely on deliberation and decentralization?

At a time when governments at all levels seem to veer from crisis to crisis as a means of getting things done, this new wave of laws is a reminder that a serious, ongoing issue is not the same as an emergency that justifies setting aside the usual lawmaking process. Put another way, there is a difference between giving a governor the power to respond to a deadly disease at the outset of a pandemic and, six or eight months later, giving that same person the power to unilaterally decide on Monday that bars must close on Wednesday night.

""You just think, 'How much longer can this go on?'"" Serulneck says, remembering how his brewery was forced to weather a pandemic as well as the whims of the state's chief executive. ""How many more times are we going to go back and forth?""

Consent of the Governed

If it was going to go on much longer, Wolf would have to get the consent of the governed. ""The citizens of Pennsylvania should have a say in reining in this extended, unilateral power on display during this emergency,"" Pennsylvania Senate Majority Leader Kim Ward (R–Westmoreland County) said on the state Senate floor in January 2021, as she announced a new plan to give the legislature a more prominent role in statewide emergencies. ""They are the ones who suffer the consequences when checks and balances don't exist.""

For the first 11 months of the pandemic, those checks and balances were indeed out of whack. Wolf's initial emergency order, issued in March 2020, was supposed to expire after 90 days, but it had been renewed by the governor on four occasions and was still in force. He ordered schools closed and banned ""non-life-sustaining"" businesses from operating.

The specifics were at times confusing. Truckers were allowed to work, but truck stops were shuttered. Small businesses whose products were deemed nonessential, such as furniture stores, were ordered to close, even though big-box retailers like Walmart were still free to sell chairs and tables alongside ""essential"" items. Laundromats were closed, leaving some Pennsylvanians without the means to wash their clothes, but they were free to buy booze from state-owned liquor stores. One of Wolf's economic advisers quit in protest, blasting the governor for the ""devastating economic fallout your decisions have wrought on our state"" in his resignation letter.

In Pennsylvania and elsewhere, the pandemic made it clear that ""states have these very broad emergency powers available to governors with very little in the way of limitations,"" says Daniel Dew, director of legal policy at the Pacific Legal Foundation, a nonprofit libertarian law firm.

The state legislature tried to play its role to little avail. In June 2020, both the House and the Senate approved a resolution that put an end to Wolf's emergency declaration from March. But the governor claimed he had the authority to veto that measure, thanks to unclear wording in the original statute regarding the governor's emergency powers.

The state Supreme Court sided with Wolf, effectively imposing a requirement that two-thirds of both chambers vote to end an emergency declaration. It would have been easier to impeach the governor—a maneuver that requires only a simple majority in the state House and a supermajority in the state Senate—than to end his emergency powers.

And so, nearly 10 months after the pandemic hit, Ward decided to try a different tactic. Pennsylvania's constitution allows the legislature to propose constitutional amendments, which must be ratified or rejected by voters. Ward's proposed amendment, contained in Senate Bill 2, limited emergency declarations to 21 days and required an affirmative vote from the legislature to renew them.

One advantage of this approach: In Pennsylvania, the governor does not have the power to veto a proposed constitutional amendment. It goes straight from the legislature to the ballot to the voters.

As the first year of the pandemic came to a close, similar debates were roiling many state capitals. In Kentucky, the Republican-controlled legislature clashed throughout the early spring with Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who in November had reimposed a mandate closing schools, bars, and restaurants and limiting groups at weddings, at funerals, and in offices. On Easter Sunday in 2020, Beshear sent state police to stop a few church services.

The Democratic governors of Kansas and North Carolina faced similar rebukes from GOP-controlled legislatures.

According to a Kaiser Health News report published in mid-September, legislators in at least 26 states had passed laws to limit public health decrees since the start of the pandemic. That count includes rules limiting governors' executive power, but it also includes states where lawmakers have exercised arguably excessive powers themselves by banning private businesses from imposing mask or vaccine mandates on employees and customers.

Not all of the clashes between legislatures and governors were motivated by partisanship. In several states, Republican lawmakers led the charge against emergency powers wielded by Republican governors—including Idaho Gov. Brad Little, who renewed his COVID-19 emergency order a whopping 10 times before state lawmakers put an end to it. In Indiana, Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb sued state legislators after they passed a law limiting his emergency powers during the pandemic. The courts upheld the new restrictions on his authority. In March, the Democrats who controlled New York's legislature struck down several of Cuomo's emergency orders.

On the other hand, some state lawmakers have been happy to pass off responsibility to the executive branch. Connecticut's legislature has voted six times, most recently in October 2021, to extend Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont's emergency pandemic powers.

Preparing for Next Time

Many of the efforts to restrict gubernatorial emergency powers kicked off in spring 2021, and a similar flurry of activity could happen in early 2022. That probably has more to do with logistics than anything. Many state legislatures are in session for a limited period of time, mostly in the first half of the year. Those sessions had been disrupted in 2020 by the start of the pandemic, so early 2021 presented the first opportunity for serious legislative consideration of what to do next. But the timing also reflected the frustration of state lawmakers who had been largely cut out of key decisions for the better part of a year—and who had been hearing plenty of complaints from pandemic-weary constituents.

In a democracy, Georgetown's Chertoff says, ""it is problematic to have governors doing so much for so long by executive order."" She adds that bringing lawmakers into the process earlier might have helped avoid some of the politicization that has plagued the pandemic response. If members of both parties had voted to approve restrictions on businesses or to mandate mask wearing, it would have been harder to treat those policies as partisan issues.

But states entered the pandemic with broad emergency-power laws already on their books. Those laws were not crafted with a yearslong health crisis in mind.

The Idaho legislature granted ""tremendous power"" to the governor when it passed an emergency-power law in the 1960s, inspired by fears of a nuclear attack that would disrupt the normal functioning of government, Idaho state Rep. Jason Monks (R–Meridian) told the Associated Press in March. He said the pandemic ""was the first time, I think, that those laws were really stress-tested."" A few weeks later, the Idaho legislature voted to impose a 60-day limit on the governor's emergency declarations.

Pacific Legal's Dew has advised some state lawmakers on the finer points of rewriting the laws governing emergency powers. They have included legislators in Kentucky, where one of the most significant reforms was passed in 2021.

When Kentucky's emergency-power law was enacted in 1998, it did not include a mechanism for the state legislature to intervene in a disaster declared by the governor. The state's legislature meets for only a few weeks every year, and only the governor can call a special session to deal with a crisis. While that arrangement was obviously tilted toward executive power, prior to the pandemic it was overwhelmingly used in response to severe weather events: 46 of the 57 previous declarations were related to storms, according to 2020 research published by the Pegasus Institute, a free market think tank in Louisville.

""When the levies broke in New Orleans, that was an emergency,"" says Josh Crawford, executive director of Pegasus, which backed the reform effort in Kentucky. ""But actually rebuilding the city afterwards, that was a question for traditional governance.""

Crawford says ""a lot of people, rightly, gave these governors a tremendous amount of leeway"" in the early stages of the pandemic, when no one really knew what was going to happen. By the end of 2020, however, the world was grappling with a different set of questions and contemplating a much longer time period. ""You're no longer really talking about an emergency,"" Crawford says. ""You're talking about an important policy question, and we have a procedure in place for dealing with important policy questions—but it's not government by executive fiat.""

To restore balance, state lawmakers in Kentucky passed what is so far the most aggressive limitation on gubernatorial emergency powers since the pandemic began. A three-bill package initially passed in January 2021 caps emergency declarations at 30 days and requires legislative consent—which can subsequently be revoked at any time—for an extension. The bills also prohibit the governor and attorney general from suspending state laws during an emergency and forbid emergency declarations that impinge on the right to worship or protest. Once an emergency declaration expires or is ended, a ""substantially similar"" one cannot be issued for 90 days.

Beshear vetoed the bills, but the state legislature overrode his veto in mid-February. A state district court issued an injunction against the new laws after Beshear argued that they would undermine Kentucky's response to the pandemic and cause avoidable deaths. But the Kentucky Supreme Court overturned that injunction in September and told the district court to rehear the case on the merits. While that legal back-and-forth was playing out, the state legislature agreed to extend Beshear's emergency pandemic powers until June 21, after which they were terminated.

""The Supreme Court has confirmed what the General Assembly has asserted throughout this case—the legislature is the only body with the constitutional authority to enact laws,"" House Speaker David Osborne and Senate President Robert Stivers, both Republicans, said in a joint statement on August 21, shortly after the state Supreme Court blocked the injunction against the law.

The outcome in Kentucky obviously has implications for the remainder of the COVID-19 pandemic. But this kind of law matters for other reasons too. State lawmakers must decide whether the next crisis, when it inevitably arrives, will play out the same way this one has.

Public Health Power Grab

That governors have fought legislative attempts to curtail their power is not surprising. But some of the loudest opposition to emergency-power reforms has come from the public health establishment.

In state after state, public health officials have lined up to defend arbitrary and aggressive pandemic rulemaking against the constraints of the democratic process. In doing so, they've defended both Democratic and Republican administrations, showing a bias toward unilateral power rather than any particular political party.

In Ohio, for example, representatives from 18 county health departments and four city health departments testified in February 2021 against a plan to strip some emergency powers from Republican Gov. Mike DeWine. State lawmakers ignored that opposition and approved a bill that limits future emergency declarations to no more than 30 days and prohibits governors from issuing stay-at-home orders or closing businesses. In response, the public health experts escalated their rhetoric. ""Each hurdle that favors a lack of public health response,"" Mark Cameron, an immunologist at Case Western Reserve University, told the Ohio Capital Journal, ""will cause infections and death.""

In May, the National Association of County and City Health Officials and the Network for Public Health Law published a joint report decrying legislative efforts to weaken governors' emergency powers during the pandemic. ""Dissatisfaction and anger at perceived overreaches by governors and public health officials in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an onslaught of legislative proposals to eliminate or limit the emergency powers and public health authority used by these officials,"" the groups said in an official statement. ""It is foreseeable that these laws will lead to preventable tragedies.""

The public health response to these bills has accurately described the circumstances—in this case, the voter dissatisfaction that is motivating the reforms—while exaggerating the potential consequences of deviating from the course plotted early in the pandemic. Public health officials have been useful in projecting the course of the pandemic and in developing mitigation strategies. But their recommendations, from the initial lockdowns to today's stay-masked-even-if-you're-vaccinated guidelines, have routinely failed to account for the practical, human considerations that are a fundamental part of crafting policy.

The May report specifically criticized a new Kansas law—passed by the Republican-controlled legislature and signed by Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, without the drama that marked similar actions in other states—barring the governor from shutting down businesses during a pandemic. Protecting the rights of business owners to not have their livelihoods upended by executive fiat would ""allow super-spreader venues"" to operate, the two public health groups warned ominously.

Imposing time limits on emergency declarations and giving state legislatures a say in whether the declarations continue is ""undermining public health authority"" and ""will jeopardize health and safety,"" the groups added. They also warned that reining in the public health power grab would make it more difficult to ""advance health equity during a pandemic.""

During an October interview with a local TV station, Washington's Democratic governor, Jay Inslee, provided a perfect example of the problems with the top-down approach that public health authorities have championed. More than a year and a half after the pandemic began, people have figured out their own strategies for managing risk and coping with the disease. But Inslee sees it differently: ""There is only one person in the state of Washington who has the capability to save those lives right now, and it happens to be the governor of the state of Washington,"" he said.

Asked whether legislators should play a larger role in making policies like vaccine mandates, Inslee said it wasn't possible ""because we need to act right now."" Asked when the crisis might be deemed to have passed, at least to the extent that would allow lawmakers into the process, Inslee said he couldn't be sure ""because there are so many metrics to look at.""

""If we make decisions today with some metric that doesn't make sense after the virus mutates, we could be making some bad decisions and losing thousands of lives,"" he said. ""We have to depend on the best science that now exists—and it changes as we learn about this, as the virus mutates.""

This sort of open-ended crisis that leaves the legislature out of the equation breaks the feedback loop that representative democracy relies upon. It also ignores the role that individual decision making plays in mitigating the effects of a deadly disease, presuming that people would be utterly helpless without the government to protect them.

And if the best argument for unilateral emergency powers is that they allow a state to be nimbler in responding to an evolving threat, then there should be evidence that states with stronger gubernatorial authority have fared better during the pandemic. But that's a difficult case to prove.

Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Washington were the three states with the most businesses forced to close during the first year of the pandemic, according to data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But Pennsylvania and Michigan have seen more deaths per 100,000 residents than the national average. It's true that some states that adopted stricter pandemic policies, including New York and California, have seen some of the lowest death rates during the pandemic (despite early spikes in both places). But the same can be said of Florida, despite widespread media consternation about its relatively laissez faire approach to COVID-19.

In places where elected representatives spent 2021 trying to stuff governors' emergency powers back into democratically defined boxes, it is undeniable that politics and partisanship played a role. At the same time, state lawmakers (and voters) may have looked at what was happening, seen that it wasn't working, and decided that something else was needed. That's not undermining the effectiveness of state government; it's democracy in action.

Always Another Emergency

COVID-19 is driving the use of emergency powers right now. But Dew worries that states without limits on those powers could find themselves facing other kinds of unilateral edicts in the future. Any one of dozens of quasi-emergencies that supposedly require a response from state governments could invite the sort of open-ended, top-down direction from the governor's office (or the White House) that has been a hallmark of the pandemic.

""That's not the way our government is supposed to function,"" Dew says. ""Emergency powers are there for the governor to steady the ship in the middle of a storm, not to set a new course.""

For special interest groups looking to impose large-scale policy changes that have been stymied by the democratic process or by legal and constitutional issues, the pandemic has not been a warning about the dangers of unilateral executive power. It has been a roadmap. Left-wing activists and even some Democratic lawmakers are increasingly pushing for governors and presidents to exert greater powers to deal with ""emergencies"" that would more accurately be described as long-term, chronic issues.

""We've already seen calls in opinion pages to declare emergencies for things like climate change, homelessness, gun violence, and opiate abuse,"" Dew says. ""Those are serious issues that the government may choose to address. But if it does, it has to be through the state's lawmaking body.""

Just a week after Joe Biden was sworn into office, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D–N.Y.) called upon the new president to declare climate change a national emergency. ""If ever there was an emergency, the climate crisis is one,"" Schumer told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow.

The majority leader was echoing a December 2020 letter to Biden's transition team from more than 300 groups. It urged the incoming administration to invoke the National Emergencies Act as a remedy for climate change, a move that would give Biden the unilateral authority to impose the policies favored by those groups. Among other things, The Washington Post explained, Biden could use such an order to direct military spending toward green energy projects, ban oil exports, or impose tariffs on countries he thinks are polluting too much.

California provides an example of what that might look like—and why limits on executive power matter. In July 2021, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an emergency declaration saying that ""the effects of climate change threaten the health and safety of Californians."" He immediately used his new powers to issue 10 pages of rules for California's electric and water utilities in response to the state's ongoing drought. In October, he extended that order and gave the state water board the authority to ban car washing and to limit how water is used in everything from construction sites to decorative fountains.

At least Newsom's ability to enact far-reaching changes via emergency order is limited: In California, unlike many other states, emergency orders issued by the governor automatically end after 60 days. (In contrast, emergency powers seized by presidents under the National Emergencies Act can persist indefinitely, as long as the sitting commander in chief renews them each year. America's longest-running ongoing ""national emergency"" was issued by President Jimmy Carter to freeze the assets of perpetrators of the Iranian hostage crisis.)

Prior to his resignation, New York's Cuomo became the first governor in the country to issue an emergency declaration targeting gun violence. The order, issued in July, redirects $139 million in state spending toward initiatives that are supposed to curtail a spike in shootings since the beginning of the pandemic.

For the most part, that means more policing. Cuomo's order created a new task force charged with stopping guns coming over New York's borders. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D–Calif.) has expressed support for a similar emergency declaration at the federal level.

But the most notable part of Cuomo's order is how long it will remain in force: ""until further notice."" That's not a response to an emergency; it's permanent policy making.

Such abuses are not limited to the political left, Dew notes. President Donald Trump used emergency powers to redirect military funding to his border wall after Congress refused to authorize spending on it. And the Trump administration was responsible for one of the pandemic's most ridiculous abuses of power: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's nationwide ban on evictions. While the federal ban was overturned by the Supreme Court in August, New York and California maintained their own eviction moratoriums, imposed via emergency orders, as of December 2021.

If past crises such as 9/11 and the subsequent war on terror teach us anything, it's that even explicitly temporary expansions of government power can easily become permanent. The difference this time around is that fewer people are even pretending their wish list measures are supposed to be temporary, as Cuomo's ""until further notice"" mandate on guns demonstrates. Rather than merely steering the ship of state through a storm, governors and presidents are increasingly using threats on the horizon to stay at the wheel.

A Hardball Approach

Pennsylvania is the first (and still the only) state to put a question about the limits of gubernatorial emergency powers before the voters since the start of the pandemic.

Wolf, the Democratic governor, objected to the Republican-controlled legislature's attempt to cut off his emergency powers via constitutional amendment. Having emergency declarations expire after just 21 days, Wolf said in a January 2021 statement, ""would hinder our ability to respond quickly, comprehensively and effectively to a disaster emergency by requiring any declaration to be affirmed by concurrent resolution of the legislature every three weeks. This would force partisan politics into the commonwealth's disaster response efforts and could slow down or halt emergency response when aid is most needed."" In the event that a disaster somehow prevented the legislature from meeting, he warned, the limit could leave the state with no legitimate leadership.

Despite those objections, lawmakers moved quickly to approve the two amendments and place them on the state's primary election ballot. ""We are not saying that the governor can't act,"" state Sen. Ryan Aument (R–Lancaster) said during the floor debate. ""We are simply saying that he can no longer act alone without justifying his actions before the people's representatives in the General Assembly.""

When Pennsylvanians went to the polls in May 2021, it was the first real test of voters' attitudes toward pandemic lockdowns. By narrow margins, they approved both constitutional amendments limiting Wolf's emergency powers.

A few weeks later, on June 8, both chambers of the state legislature used those newly granted constitutional powers to terminate the governor's emergency order. After more than 460 days, the official ""emergency"" phase of the pandemic was over.

The pandemic itself, of course, rages on. But the debate about which policies are necessary to control it—lockdowns, mask mandates, vaccine passports, and whatever comes next—should be wholly separate from the debate about how those decisions are made. Democracy is messy, but neither legislatures nor governors (nor unelected public health experts) have a monopoly on the truth, or on the proper balance between safety and freedom.

""The separation of powers matter,"" Chertoff says. ""They're supposed to be checking one another.""

She worries that some states may have, for partisan reasons, gone too far in restraining how governors can act in the face of a genuine future emergency. But by refusing to give lawmakers a seat at the table as the weeks and months passed, some governors may have invited a hardball approach. To limit the power of the state, James Madison famously wrote in The Federalist Papers, ""ambition must be made to counteract ambition.""

High-minded ideals aside, at Seven Sirens Brewing Co., the passage of the constitutional amendments and subsequent neutering of Wolf's emergency order brought some relief. Serulneck knows he could be facing another tough winter, but at least another state-mandated shutdown seems to be off the table.

Anyone who walks inside Serulneck's taphouse in the coming months will certainly be aware of the risks. The new omicron variant is a reminder that COVID-19 is still a crisis—but it's not an emergency.

Individuals can make their own risk assessments without state intervention. Control-obsessed politicians ""have less legal ground to stand on now,"" Serulneck says. ""When the emergency order powers were stripped, that pretty much put an end to it.""",Q4

Tim Michels, who is running for governor, has embraced the idea that the 2020 election was not run fairly.

Ever since claims of election fraud arose in 2020, Wisconsin has seen its share of quixotic attempts to taint the presidential results.

A group of phony electors tried to claim the state’s electoral votes for Donald Trump. Wisconsin’s top lawmaker launched a yearlong inquiry led by a lawyer spewing election fraud theories. And its courts heard numerous suits challenging the integrity of the 2020 election and the people administering it.

All those efforts failed, sometimes spectacularly.

But on a more fundamental level, the election deniers succeeded. They helped change the way Election Day will look in 2022 for crucial midterm elections in Wisconsin — and they are creating an even more favorable climate for Trump and Republicans in 2024.

This summer, the conservative majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court banned most drop boxes for ballots, which had provided another quick and convenient method of voting during the pandemic, rather than relying on the mail. Until a federal judge intervened, the ruling also meant that people with disabilities could not have help delivering their ballots to their municipal clerks.

More recently, in Waukesha County, a judge sided with the Republican Party in a ruling that barred local clerks from fixing even minor errors or omissions — such as a missing ZIP code — on absentee ballot envelopes. The clerks could contact the voter or return the ballot to be corrected. In a state already known for limiting voter access, this was another example of a push toward more controls.

And the Wisconsin Assembly and the Senate, both dominated by Republicans, have passed a raft of bills that would tighten voting laws. Each was vetoed by Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat. But Evers is in a close race for reelection against Republican Tim Michels, who has said that “on day one” he will call a special session of the Legislature to “fix the election mess.”

Philip Rocco, associate professor of political science at Marquette University in Milwaukee, describes a dynamic he has seen across the country playing out on a large scale in Wisconsin. An onslaught of attacks on the voting process, he said, produces “an atmosphere of procedural chaos going into Election Day.”

“Just in general, it’s created a dangerous environment for elections to occur in.”

Republicans, who often benefit from lower turnout, frame the battles around issues of law, while Democrats argue that the fight is over voting rights. Neither side sees any benefit in giving in.

The seemingly daily news of legal machinations, legislative committee hearings, proposed laws or official investigations of Wisconsin’s election system have left many voters worried about what to expect when they next try to cast a ballot and unsure of whether their vote will count.

A swing state with 10 electoral votes and a history of razor-thin margins, Wisconsin will once again be a key prize in the 2024 presidential race.

Just how important the state is became clear in August, when the Republican National Committee announced that it will hold its 2024 convention in Milwaukee, a typically overlooked, Democratic-led city. The convention will saturate the state’s largest media market, reaching the conservative-leaning suburbs and the quiet towns and farms beyond.

But first comes November’s midterm election, with a chance to consolidate Republican power in the state and shape oversight of coming elections. Both ends of the political spectrum are keenly aware of the stakes.

“What can happen in 2024 is largely going to be determined by what happens this November,” said Wisconsin attorney Jeffrey Mandell, president of a progressive firm dedicated to protecting voting rights.

Endless Legal Battles

Nine attorneys, a parade of dark suits and briefcases, descended on a Waukesha County courtroom in southeast Wisconsin in September. Once again, the extreme minutiae of Wisconsin election law was being litigated.

The question before them: how to deal with absentee ballot envelopes that arrive with only partial addresses of witnesses?

Until then, municipal clerks had been able to simply fill in the information. Now, the Republican Party of Waukesha County argued that was unlawful and wanted to prohibit clerks from doing so. For some voters, that could mean having their ballots returned and figuring out how to fix them in time to have their vote counted.

A lawyer for the GOP-controlled Legislature favored a prohibition. Lawyers for government regulators, Democrats and the League of Women Voters argued against it. Ultimately, the GOP side prevailed.

In his ruling, Circuit Judge Michael J. Aprahamian added his voice to the doubts about absentee voting in Wisconsin and about the oversight provided by the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission, which has seen its every move scrutinized since Trump and his allies started questioning the 2020 results in Wisconsin.

Aprahamian excoriated the commission, saying that “it is little wonder that proponents from all corners of the political spectrum are critical, cynical and suspicious of how elections are managed and overseen.”

As court scenes like these play out elsewhere in Wisconsin, a healthy slice of the litigation can be traced to one man: Erick Kaardal, a Minnesota lawyer and special counsel to the anti-abortion Thomas More Society, a nonprofit law firm.

Despite some high-profile setbacks in Wisconsin, Kaardal told ProPublica he plans to keep scrutinizing the fine points of Wisconsin election law, a subject that takes up at least 122 pages in state statute.

His ongoing targets include the Wisconsin Elections Commission, which interprets laws and gives guidance to municipal clerks around the state; the Electronic Registration Information Center, a voter roll management consortium; and the Center for Election Innovation & Research, a nonprofit that seeks to improve turnout.

“We’ll be litigating with the WEC and ERIC and CEIR for years to come,” Kaardal said.

Kaardal’s persistence is not appreciated by everyone. A federal judge admonished him for “political grandstanding” and filing bad-faith litigation against then-Vice President Mike Pence in December 2020 to prevent the counting of electoral votes. And in May, a judge in Madison said it was “ridiculous” for Kaardal to label pandemic-related grants to election offices as bribes.

In defending his tactics, Kaardal cited his years of legal experience and investigative abilities. He said he merely wants to hold government accountable and make elections fair.

Among Kaardal’s most passionate causes is his ongoing effort to document election fraud at nursing homes. During the pandemic, Kaardal alleges, an unknown number of cognitively impaired people ruled incompetent to vote under court-ordered guardianships somehow voted, perhaps with illegal assistance. He believes the voter rolls are not being updated to accurately reflect the court orders.

Kaardal brought lawsuits against 13 probate administrators across Wisconsin to force the release of confidential documents revealing the names of individuals under guardianship who have had their right to vote stripped by the court. His petition was denied in one case, but the others are ongoing.

Dane County Clerk of Court Carlo Esqueda worries that Kaardal’s quest is giving people the wrong impression. He points out that a person under guardianship can still vote. In some instances, that right is taken away because of extreme cognitive issues.

“Talk radio is saying everybody under guardianship should not be able to vote. That’s simply not true,” he said.

Election clerks, too, cite disinformation as they face mounting pressure over how they handle absentee ballots.

Celestine Jeffreys, the clerk in Green Bay, was forced to defend her integrity when a local resident represented by Kaardal filed a formal complaint with the Wisconsin Elections Commission this year, accusing her of “ballot harvesting” in the spring 2022 municipal elections by accepting multiple absentee ballots from an individual voter. The complaint is still pending.

Matt Roeser, the resident who filed the complaint, told ProPublica that the heavy reliance on absentee voting during the pandemic “opened up a door we’ve never had opened before. It created a lot of suspicion.”

Jeffreys said in a court filing that she had the discretion at the time to accept multiple ballots if they involved someone delivering their own ballot and a ballot for a disabled person.

Her legal brief called the complaint “another attempt by Attorney Kaardal to court scandal where there is none — intentionally undermining public confidence in legitimately-run elections in the process.”

Energized Activists

Wisconsin resident Harry Wait drew national attention in July when he announced that he’d gone on a state website and arranged for absentee ballots in the names of the Racine mayor, the state Assembly speaker and several others to be sent to his home.

The site requires only that voters enter their name and date of birth, and Wait claimed it had insufficient safeguards to prevent fraud.

The antic angered the Wisconsin Elections Commission, which held that it was a serious breach meant to undermine the state’s election system. Authorities charged Wait with election fraud, a misdemeanor, and misappropriation of ID information, a felony.

Notwithstanding the charges, Wait was treated like a hero a week later at a meeting of the right-leaning group he leads inside a Racine dive bar.

Wait formed H.O.T. Government, which stands for honest, open, transparent, four years ago over perceived government misconduct in Racine. It’s now focused on rooting out what it sees as widespread election fraud throughout Wisconsin and is taking special interest in absentee ballots. The group even briefly considered a plan to steal leftover drop boxes in southeast Wisconsin to ensure they couldn’t be used after the state Supreme Court ruling.

Wait has made it clear he’s no fan of the Wisconsin Elections Commission. “I’m going to make a declaration today that WEC is our enemy,” he told the crowd inside the bar.

He was proud how, in his view, he had exposed the flaws in the state government’s MyVote website, set up to help Wisconsinites find their polling place, register to vote or order an absentee ballot. The website, he said, “really needs to be shut down.”

Wait said in an interview that he plans to defend his action in court on the basis that, in his view, the MyVote system is “not a legal channel to order a ballot. It’s a rogue system.”

The administrator of the Wisconsin Elections Commission, Meagan Wolfe, has defended the online system. It “requires a person to provide the same information or more information than he or she would have to provide if the person made the ballot request through traditional mail,” she said at a commission meeting.

Still, the commission agreed to a new safeguard: When it gets a request to send an absentee ballot to a new address, it will notify the voter via postcard. The commission also asked clerks to be on the lookout for unusual requests.

At a preliminary hearing on his case, in September, Wait was represented by Michael Gableman, a leading figure among Wisconsin election deniers.

A former state Supreme Court justice, Gableman was special counsel for the Wisconsin Assembly, tasked with investigating the 2020 election. While spending more than $1 million in taxpayer money, he lent oxygen to election-fraud theories — including Kaardal’s accusations about nursing home irregularities — but couldn’t prove any. Attempts to reach Gableman for comment for this story were unsuccessful.

Even after being dismissed from that role by the Assembly speaker, Gableman has continued to exert influence within the state Republican Party to stoke the anger of citizens. Among hard-right activists, Gableman’s view of Wisconsin as a hotbed of election fraud is now taken for granted, as is the belief that voting options should be restricted, not opened up.

“I want it back to in-person, one day,” said Bruce L. Boll, a volunteer with We the People Waukesha, one of numerous groups supporting tighter controls. “Voting should not be a whim. It should be something you plan for and you do. Like your wedding day.”

Responding to this new atmosphere of distrust, the Wisconsin Elections Commission has proposed creating an Office of Inspector General to help it investigate the growing number of complaints and allegations of impropriety.

Chaos and Controversy

The chaos and controversy around voting rules has caught some Wisconsinites off guard. The drop-box ruling was especially disconcerting to people with disabilities and their relatives.

Before the August primary, Eugene Wojciechowski, of West Allis, went to City Hall to pay his water bill and drop off his ballot and his wife’s at the clerk’s office. A staffer asked him for ID and then told him he could not deliver his wife’s ballot. Not even spouses of the disabled could do so at the time, thanks to the state Supreme Court decision.

“I said: ‘What do you mean? She’s in a wheelchair,’” Wojciechowski recalled. He noted that the ballots were “all sealed and witnessed and everything.”

The voting constraints were “stupid,” he said, but ultimately he decided he would just mail his wife’s ballot for her, even though it was unclear at the time whether that was permitted.

He has filed an official complaint with the Wisconsin Elections Commission and weeks later remains exasperated.

“I mean, what the hell is going on in this city? I’ve lived here all my life,” Wojciechowski said.

“They’re stopping people from voting, that’s all it is.”

The state Supreme Court decision came in response to a suit brought by a conservative group, the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty. An attorney for the group, Rick Esenberg, argued that regulators had issued unlawful guidance allowing ballots to be delivered on behalf of others, including potentially “paid activists, paid canvassers who go around and collect ballots and place them in a mailbox.” Those allegations echoed a widely circulated conspiracy theory about people, labeled mules, delivering heaps of fraudulent ballots.

Esenberg conceded in his oral arguments that he had no evidence of that type of activity in Wisconsin.

Four people with disabilities sued in federal court, including Martha Chambers, of Milwaukee, who was left paralyzed from the neck down after being thrown from a horse 27 years ago.

“Here they are making things more difficult for me, and my life is difficult enough,” she said.

A federal judge ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered the state elections commission to tell local clerks that voters with disabilities must be allowed to receive help from someone of their choosing to return their absentee ballots. The clerks do not have to confirm that the voter is disabled or ask the emissary for ID.

Still, it’s not at all certain that the ruling will be followed uniformly.

The state has approximately 1,850 local clerks who administer elections in cities, towns and villages. Even before the federal ruling, practices were wildly inconsistent, said Barbara Beckert, director of external advocacy for Disability Rights Wisconsin.

“There is continuing confusion in Wisconsin as voting practices and policies continue to change in response to litigation as well as action by the Legislature,” Beckert said.

Political observers say there’s increased trepidation among all kinds of voters over whether their ballot will count and who will be watching at the polls.

“People are afraid,” said Milwaukee native Bruce Colburn, a union activist and lead organizer of Souls to the Polls, a traditional get-out-the-vote drive in Black communities. “Are they going to do something wrong? Then you have all these lawyers and people making complaints in the court system for nothing. And it makes it more difficult. It scares people. If they get something wrong or they don’t do it exactly right, something’s going to happen to them.”

Jeffreys, the clerk in Green Bay, described poll watchers on primary day this year as “aggressive and interfering.” Rather than being cordial and unobtrusive, she said, some observers were repeatedly questioning voting officials and disrupting the process.

“That, I think, is a really big change with elections in Wisconsin. There’s just a lot more of a gaze, and the gaze is not always friendly and cooperative.”

Unlike poll workers, who carry out official duties and must be local residents, poll watchers can come from anywhere. They are not required to undergo training.

“Observers are a very important part of the process,” Jeffreys said. “They lend transparency; they help educate people. They themselves become educated. But sometimes observers have anointed themselves as the people who will uncover problems. And oftentimes observers are not equipped with the information in order to do that.”

The result, she said, can be baseless allegations.

Pointing Toward 2024

If Republicans in Wisconsin want to find a way around the Democratic governor, Evers, and his veto pen, they have two choices.

They can unseat him in November or bulk up their legislative advantage to what is called a supermajority. Achieving supermajorities in both the Assembly and the Senate, which would make bills veto-proof, is considered the longer shot. Winning the governor’s race is not.

Michels, the Republican nominee, is the owner of a construction company and has never held public office. He was endorsed by Trump in the primary.

Michels has embraced the idea that the 2020 election was not run fairly, even though a state recount showed Biden won and multiple courts agreed. Asked if the 2020 election was stolen, Michels told the “Regular Joe Show” on the radio in May: “Maybe, right. We know there was certainly a lot of bad stuff that happened. There were certainly illegal legal ballots. How many? I don’t know if Justice Gableman knows. I don’t know if anybody knows. We got to make sure. I will make sure it doesn’t happen again.”

A Michels victory would set the stage for reconsideration of a range of restrictive voting laws that were vetoed by Evers.

Among the bills passed by Republicans and blocked by Evers were proposals that would require the state to use federal databases to check citizenship status; remove voters from the rolls based on information submitted for jury selection; make it harder to request an absentee ballot; and classify it a felony to incorrectly attest that a person is “indefinitely confined” so they can vote absentee (a provision widely used during the pandemic).

Wisconsin already is a place that researchers have identified as difficult for voters to navigate. The Cost of Voting Index, a Northern Illinois University project that studies each state, lists it near the bottom, at 47th, because of a strict voter ID law, limits on early voting and proof of residency requirements that affect registration drives.

“Over the last several election cycles, other states have adopted policies that remove barriers to voting,” one of the researchers, Michael J. Pomante II, now with the election protection group States United Action, said in an email.

But Wisconsin, he added, “has continued to pass and implement laws that create barriers to casting a ballot.”

In 2024, all these factors — from who is able to vote to who runs the executive branch and who runs the Legislature — will play a role in determining which presidential candidate gets Wisconsin’s electoral votes.

The governor and the Wisconsin Elections Commission are part of the state’s certification process, with the secretary of state making it official by affixing the state seal. And the state Supreme Court stands ready to rule on election law disputes.

The Nov. 8 midterm election will determine which party holds the office of governor and secretary of state when voting occurs in 2024. Michels has proposed a “full reorganization” of the Wisconsin Elections Commission if he is elected.

He hasn’t explained what that would look like, other than to say in a primary debate that he envisioned replacing it with a board made up of appointees named by each of the state’s congressional districts. Wisconsin now has eight seats in the U.S. House, five held by Republicans and three by Democrats.

Evers, by contrast, backs the commission in its current form. He noted its origins in the state’s Legislature seven years ago.

“Republicans created this system, and it works,” he said in a statement released to ProPublica. “Our last election was fair and secure, as was proven by a recount, our law enforcement agencies, and the courts.”

Bodies of 36-year-old Jasdeep Singh, 27-year-old Jasleen Kaur, their eight-month-old child Aroohi Dheri and the baby's uncle, 39-year-old Amandeep Singh were found on Wednesday evening in an orchard after they were kidnapped on Monday.

The family, originally from Harsi Pind in Hoshiarpur, Punjab, was kidnapped at a business in Merced County, California.

The city of Merced has organised a candlelight vigil for the family every night at 7 pm from October 6 to October 9.

The crowd that gathered in the stately downtown Bob Hart Square on Thursday came from all backgrounds — young, old, Latino, Black, Sikh, white, wealthy, low income and stood in solidarity with the Singh and Kaur families at the vigil. They chanted prayers in Punjabi, Spanish and English, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

There have been lives that have been taken, Lord, innocent lives, and we don’t understand,” Christian Life Center Pastor Ceasar Johnson boomed to the crowd as he wept openly. “Comfort us, Lord,” the report said.

Sukh Bela, a friend of the slain family, said he and the tightly knit Merced-area Sikh community will be leaning on their faith in the coming days and weeks. But he added that the healing they hope to find will be made stronger by the support reflected in the sea of faces at Thursday’s gathering.

“We’re trying to hold true to three tenets of our faith,” he told the crowd. “Meditation... staying in high spirits... justice and prosperity for everyone. We thank you for being here,” Bela said.

There was a huge memorial of candles, flowers, pictures and stuffed animals at the sunset vigil.

“Taken 2 soon,” read one sign near an unopened package of a Barbie doll dressed in a pink party dress, the likes of which little Aroohi will never get to wear. “Together we are stronger,” read another sign.

The suspect in the killing of the family had once worked for the family's trucking business and had a longstanding dispute with them that got ""pretty nasty"" and culminated in an act of senseless killing, authorities and a relative said.

""Our family just lost four precious family souls,"" Jasdeep and Amandeep’s cousin Sukhdeep Singh said. ""Now, we’re all shattered.""

Family members, close friends and complete strangers shared warm embraces. Religious leaders said prayers, as a sea of candles burned brightly in the night. Grappling with grief, those closest to the family asked the community to embrace the surviving family members, KCRA reported.

""They're going to need our support, our help, and we ask the community to stay with us, help us, help them,"" family friend Ranjeet Singh said.

Over the past two decades, Lark has quietly trained up a critical mass of talented chefs and other industry pros. So it’s fitting that the restaurant will celebrate its 20th anniversary next year with a series of dinner collaborations that will reunite some notable alums.

Chef and co-owner John Sundstrom sent up the Northwest cuisine version of the bat signal (hopefully it’s shaped like a geoduck) and summoned chefs like Evan Leichtling of Off Alley, longtime Cafe Juanita chef de cuisine Lauren Thompson, and baking savant Ben Campbell. Anyone missing Sawyer will be jazzed to see chef Mitch Mayers will be in the kitchen for the October dinner. Similarly, fans of the former Little Uncle can revisit its magic with cofounders Wiley Frank and Poncharee Kounpungchart.

Since reopening with a new menu format last year, the restaurant has done a few smaller, omakase-style dinners up in its mezzanine and enjoyed the vibe, says Sundstrom. As he and co-owner Kelly Ronan pondered how to mark 20 years in a business not exactly built for longevity, their thoughts turned to all the people in their collective professional past.

""You try to create an environment where people will stay more than the typical amount,"" Sundstrom said when I asked him the (admittedly corny) question of how his kitchen ended up being such an influential training ground. “We wanted to do something super fun, and wanted people to come back and see their own buddies.”

The imprint on Seattle’s food scene isn’t limited to the kitchen. Ronan, who runs the front of house, instilled her hospitality ethos in staff members like Rachel Marshall and Kate Opatz, who went on to open Montana and Nacho Borracho (together), not to mention Rachel’s Ginger Beer and La Dive (separately). The duo will return to do beverage service for a dinner in April. Marshall started making ginger beer in the kitchen at Licorous, the cocktail bar that Lark’s owners once ran next door to their original location. Little Uncle began as a popup here, too.

Six dinners scheduled throughout 2023 pair two chefs—“a little bit grouped by era,” says Sundstrom—to fashion a menu all their own. These will happen upstairs, with capacity for just 40 people. Email [email protected] to purchase tickets. Hopefully it doesn't devolve into a Taylor Swift situation.

To scan the schedule below is to remember how much of Lark’s DNA currently informs our current food scene. The restaurant will celebrate its official 20th birthday (one year from today, as it happens) with some sort of proper party. Meanwhile, these dinners will book fast...

The family members of four Idaho college students who were killed in November released statements after officials said a suspect, Bryan Christopher Kohberger, was arrested late last week.

After Kohberger’s arrest, Steve Goncalves, victim Kaylee Goncalves’s father, said he saw links between Kohberger and his daughter, a lawyer for the family told ABC News. Nobody in the family recognized the suspect, the lawyer said, adding that he wouldn’t elaborate on the alleged connections.

“Now that there’s a person and a name that someone can specifically look for and see if there’s any connections in any way. So they’re just trying to figure it out,” family attorney Shanon Grey told ABC News.

Jason LaBar, the chief public defender for Monroe County, Pennsylvania, told CNN that Kohberger is “shocked a little bit” after he was arrested last week at his home in connection to the killing of Goncalves, 21; Madison Mogen, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, in November. LaBar said Kohberger would waive his extradition this week to expedite his return to Idaho.

“We are relieved this chapter is over because it provides a form of closure. However, it doesn’t alter the outcome or alleviate the pain,” Chapin’s family said in a statement to ABC after his arrest. “We miss Ethan, and our family is forever changed.”

Xana Kernodle’s cousin, Sheldon Kernodle, urged people to come forward with more information. “Our work isn’t done yet,” he wrote on social media.

Other Details In his interview with the network, LaBar said he did not discuss the murder charges and did not have probable cause documents in connection to the case. LaBar said he is only representing Kohberger in connection to his extradition from Pennsylvania to Idaho.

“It’s a procedural issue, and really all the Commonwealth here has to prove is that he resembles or is the person who the arrest warrant is out for and that he was in the area at the time of the crime,” LaBar said . The attorney, meanwhile, said that waiving the extradition was “an easy decision” because “he doesn’t contest that he is Bryan Kohberger.”

“Mr. Kohberger is eager to be exonerated of these charges and looks forward to resolving these matters as promptly as possible,” LaBar also said, adding that his client should be presumed innocent until he is proven guilty. Since his arrest in Pennsylvania, there have been numerous unconfirmed reports from the New York Post and Daily Mail tabloids—citing unnamed sources—about Kohberger and his possible motives.

Officials in Moscow, Idaho, on Dec. 30 held a news conference that named Kohberger as the primary suspect in the case, coming weeks after the murders were reported. For weeks, investigators said they were baffled by the case and frequently asked the public for help in providing possible clues, and by mid-December, investigators were working through nearly 12,000 tips and had identified more than 22,000 vehicles matching that make and model.

The killings initially mystified law enforcement and shook the small town of Moscow a community of about 25,000 people that had not had a murder for five years. Fears of a repeat attack prompted nearly half of the University of Idaho’s more than 11,000 students to leave the city and switch to online classes.

Latah County prosecutor Bill Thompson confirmed a criminal complaint was filed against Kohberger with four counts of murder and other charges in connection to the case. An affidavit has been sealed until Kohberger returns to Idaho, he said.

“Once he gets here, he will have an initial appearance with a magistrate,” Thompson said.

A day later, Moscow Police Department Captain Anthony Dahlinger told The Associated Press that “we believe we’ve got our man.” Investigators obtained samples of Kohberger’s DNA directly from the suspect after he was arrested, Dahlinger said.

“He’s the one that we believe is responsible for all four of the murders,” he said.

Kohberger graduated from Northampton Community College in Pennsylvania with an associate of arts degree in psychology in 2018, according to college spokesperson Mia Rossi-Marino. A Ph.D. student with the same name is listed in the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at Washington State University, which is a short drive across the state line from the University of Idaho.

DeSales University in Pennsylvania confirmed that a student by that name received a bachelor’s degree in 2020 and completed graduate studies in June 2022.

(BROWARD COUNTY, FL)– A local jail guard is now behind bars after he illegally conducted a traffic stop and pointed a gun at a vehicle that reportedly cut him off.

53-year-old Eric Tyre Harris was taken into custody on oct. 3rd.

Police say Harris was traveling east in the 5000 block of W. Commercial Boulevard in Tamarac when he was cut off by a blue 2018 Ford Fusion around 9:30 a.m.

When Harris caught up to the vehicle at the next traffic light, he flashed his badge and told the driver to pull over.

The driver was said to have ignored Harris’ commands so Harris followed them into a Walgreens parking lot.

Once in the parking lot, Harris cornered the vehicle and pointed a gun at them.

He then ordered the driver and other passengers, which included two children, to get out of the car and onto the ground.

One of the passengers was able to call 911 and remained on the phone with an operator until authorities arrived.

Harris admitted to flashing his Florida Department of Corrections badge and to pulling out his handgun.

He told deputies that he smelled marijuana coming from the vehicle and was not sure if they were armed.

Harris has since been arrested and is facing five counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.",Q4

https://menafn.com/1105301760/Israel-Says-Its-Forces-Killed-Palestinian-Girl-In-West-Bank-Raid,Israel Says Its Forces Killed Palestinian Girl In West Bank Raid,"JENIN, Palestinian Territories - Israel said on Monday its forces unintentionally shot dead a Palestinian girl during a raid in Jenin, a flashpoint city in the occupied West where dozens of Palestinians including local fighters have been killed in recent months.

Israeli forces said it came under fire during an operation late Sunday to arrest three people 'suspected of terror involvement'.

'The girl who was killed was hit by unintentional fire aimed at armed gunmen on a roof in the area from which the force was fired upon,' an statement said, adding that no were hurt.

Sixteen-year-old Jana Zakarna was alone on the roof of her home late Sunday when she was targeted by an Israeli sniper positioned in an empty building, her relatives told AFP.

'She went up [to the roof] to fetch her cat and never came back, so her brother went up to look for her; he opened the door and found Jana lying here on her back,' said Yasser Mahmoud Zakarna, 28, the teenager's uncle.

Describing his niece's wounds, he said she was 'shot with four bullets in deadly spots: in the head, the face, and twice in the chest. They have truly killed childhood.'

A white cat walked around the rooftop, where there was a pool of blood and yellow tape marking what the Zakarna family said were bullet holes.

Two Palestinians were wounded in the Israeli raid, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society whose medics operate in the area.

Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 June War. The country's defence minister, Benny Gantz, said on Monday soldiers“do not shoot deliberately at uninvolved people”.

Israeli forces have launched near-daily raids in the northern West Bank since fatal attacks carried out by Palestinians or Arab-Israelis targeting Israelis earlier this year.

At least 150 Palestinians and 26 Israelis have been killed this year across Israel, the contested city of Jerusalem, and the West Bank. A further 49 Palestinians were killed during three days of fighting between Gaza militants and Israel in August.

Militants, children as young as 12 and veteran Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh are among more than 40 Palestinians killed in the Jenin area during Israeli operations this year.

After his niece's death, Zakarna said“there's no way to be safe” during the frequent raids.

A general strike was called in Jenin following the girl's killing, prompting shopkeepers to pull down their shutters. Mourners gathered for the funeral, with olive branches placed on her body which was wrapped in a Palestinian flag.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) called a gay politician a “groomer” on Tuesday in response to concerns over recent violence aimed at the LGBTQ community.

Following the shooting at a gay club in Colorado over the weekend, where five people were killed, California state Sen. Scott Wiener (D) denounced the use of the word groomer as an anti-LGBTQ slur.

The word ‘groomer’ is categorically an anti-LGBTQ hate word. It’s super homophobic/transphobic,” he said. “It plays into the slander that LGBTQ people are pedophiles. It’s no different than calling someone a fagg*t. If you call someone groomer, you’re inciting violence against LGBTQ people.”

Just two days later, Greene chose to refer to Wiener as exactly that in a quote tweet of his remark.

“Pass my Protect Children’s Innocence Act to stop communist groomers like this from using state government power to take children away from their parents to allow a for-profit medical industry to chop off these confused children’s genitals before they are even old enough to vote,” Greene tweeted.

Searches ensued, but ended after three days when a fisherman found her body next to the Snake River, Canyon County authorities previously said.

An autopsy revealed that the child had been sexually assaulted and had suffered blunt force injuries to her torso and her head, KTVB previously reported. Her cause of death was found to be drowning and ruled as a homicide, court documents say.

According to the probable cause affidavit, when Daralyn was found, the crotch of her pants was covered in blood.

Nearly 40 years later in 2020, DNA evidence linked a 64-year-old man, David Dalrymple, to the rape and murder of Johnson, authorities said. Dalrymple was charged with first-degree murder and rape.

Dalrymple pleaded not guilty to all charges on Thursday. His trial, according to Canyon County Judge Thomas Whitney, will last four weeks long next year, beginning on March 13.

The State of Idaho is not seeking the death penalty in this case, but Dalrymple could face up to life in prison if convicted and a $50,000 for both counts of rape and murder.

Authorities also believe Dalrymple is responsible for the molestation of other young girls.

""During our investigation, the Canyon County Sheriff's Office have located two other victims of similar age to Daralyn, who never reported to law enforcement to being sexually abused by David Dalrymple,"" Sheriff Donahue said in aa 2020 press conference. ""We are asking the public, we are imploring the public if you have any information on those cases or on this current case to please come forward and contact my office, or as Brian said, the Crime Stoppers.""

Dalrymple is currently serving 20 years to life in prison for lewd and lascivious conduct with a minor under 16. He was also convicted of kidnapping, sexual abuse of a minor and second degree of kidnapping.

Dalrymple's preliminary hearing will take place Feb. 6 at 2:30 p.m. at the Canyon County Courthouse.

https://www.mcknights.com/news/nursing-home-workers-end-6-week-strike-get-minimum-medical-wage-and-1-year-deal/,"Nursing home workers end 6-week strike, get minimum medical wage and 1-year deal","Workers returned to Sunnyside Convalescent Hospital in Fresno, CA, Wednesday after a six-week strike netted them at least the medical minimum wage and a wage scale based on seniority. The 99-bed facility stayed open throughout.

The sides forged a one-year deal, and will resume bargaining in nine months, according to a spokesman for the workers’ union, SEIU 2015.

“That seniority thing is a big deal,” said Terry Carter, the union spokesman. “It accrues from the date of employment at the facility, regardless of any change in ownership.”

Sunnyside’s owner, Mario Marasigan, did not respond to requests for comment from McKnight’s Long-Term Care News and local media.

Sunnyside workers struck Oct. 6, complaining of unsafe working conditions, pay at less than minimum wage and bounced paychecks.

Maria Xiquin, SEIU 2015’s regional director for the Central Valley and Central Coast, said that SEIU 2015 asked the state Department of Health Care Services to audit Sunnyside’s wages. SEIU 2015 represents more than 400,000 long-term care workers in California.

The Bee confirmed the state’s audit found Sunnyside’s management was paying employees less than the required 58 cents above the state’s $15 minimum hourly wage for non-medical staff and 78 cents above that for medical staff.

Workers said they went on strike when Sunnyside management ignored their demands for better pay and working conditions. The strike was just the latest labor stoppage in a year full of nursing home workers flexing their power.

Sunnyside workers held an initial one-day strike in September. With no progress, the staff returned to the picket lines, and during the six-week strike, some strikers and their supporters fasted in protest at a local park.",Q4
http://www.farmers-exchange.net/detailPage.aspx?articleID=22123,The Farmer's Exchange Online Mitloehner: Methane Is Misjudged,"Mitloehner: Methane Is Misjudged

Published: Friday, December 23, 2022

Imagine two bathtubs: One has a drain, the other does not. The faucets are running on low, and, eventually, the bathtub without a drain fills up. The water in the other bathtub, however, flows down the drain as fast as it leaves the faucet. Only when the faucets are running on high does the tub with the drain begin to fill up.

This is the analogy Frank Mitloehner of the University of California-Davis gave regarding methane emissions from cows during the Indiana Farm Bureau Convention in Indianapolis last Friday. The drainless bathtub represents carbon dioxide and the bathtub with a drain represents methane.

The illustration shows the difference between a stock greenhouse gas (GHG) and a flow gas. Stock gases, such as carbon dioxide, accumulate while flow gases run in a cycle, continually being added and destroyed in the atmosphere.

Methane, therefore, only accrues when there are extremely high emissions.

However, methane is currently being treated like a stock gas, which creates a stigma around agriculture.

""The current narrative around agriculture is negative,"" the air quality specialist said. ""But American farmers can be part of the climate solution.""

California Legislature passed a bill that aims to reduce GHGs by 40% before 2030. This is an update from the original bill passed in 2006 that attempted to reduce emissions to the 1990 levels by 2020, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration's independent statistics and analysis.

""Since 2015, California dairies have reduced GHGs by 2 million metric tons, a reduction of 30%,"" Mitloehner said.

Farmers are achieving this by covering the manure and catching the methane emitted from it. The gas can then be turned into fuel for transportation, commonly known as renewable natural gas (RNG).

""By managing methane, you make money while reducing GHGs,"" Mitloehner said. ""Until last year, dairies could make up to $2,000 per year per cow by managing methane.""

The amount of revenue has since fallen, but participation in the program has increased.

While California dairy farmers are contributing to the solution, agriculture remains stigmatized for its GHG emissions. This is because the current measurement of global warming potential that GHGs have (GWP-100) treats all gases as stock gases.

But methane is not a stock gas.

For every GWP-100 of carbon dioxide, 28 GWP-100s are produced, according to the current measuring system. However, Mitloehner says this is not an accurate read of methane's impact. In fact, it is off kilter by approximately 3 or 4 GWP-100.

Why?

Mitloehner explains that 558 tera-grams of methane are produced globally, but because methane is a flow gas, 548 tera-grams of methane are destroyed, leaving only 10 tera-grams in the atmosphere.

Chemical reactions in the atmosphere account for the destruction of 515 tera-grams and the soil erodes another 33 tera-grams of the gas.

""Methane is special. It has a much shorter lifespan,"" he said.

While carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for 1,000 years, methane has a lifespan of only 12 years. A more recent global warming potential unit, GWP* takes the shorter lifespan of methane into account, creating more accurate measurements of the environmental impact of the GHGs.

Mitloehner also discussed biogenic carbon and fossil fuels. Biogenic carbon refers to the carbon dioxide produced by cows and other animals.

Carbon is transmitted into plants through photosynthesis, creating carbon dioxide which is turned into carbohydrates in the grass which cows eat. After cows eat the grass, the carbon dioxide is emitted through belches back into the air to repeat the cycle. As with methane, this form of carbon dioxide is constantly created and destroyed, offering a balance of the gas level.

The majority of GHGs are released by fossil fuels, not cows, Mitloehner said. In fact, the number of dairy cows in the U.S. has declined by 16 million from 1950 to 2022. This has decreased the carbon footprint by 66%.

Mitloehner also reports that methane has not increased in the U.S., but Third World countries are responsible for higher methane levels in the atmosphere.

Even so, by managing methane, dairy farmers can reduce emissions of the gas across the U.S. by significant amounts, as California dairies are. Mitloehner says this is a more effective way to manage GHGs than if everybody in the U.S. became vegan, which would only reduce GHG emissions by 2.6%.

Mitloehner closed with a warning: Watch out for what other countries are doing to manage GHGs. In the Netherlands, farmers have been protesting because legislation has been passed to reduce the Dutch livestock sector by one-third. Farmers there are asked to sign a contract stating that they, nor their children, will ever farm again.

Ireland is also making moves to reduce one-third of its GHG emissions, and New Zealand has incorporated a methane tax for livestock owners.

While reducing the amount of GHGs emitted into the atmosphere is important, Mitloehner says it is also important to keep in mind that there is a safe amount of GHGs that the earth needs to protect itself from the sun and frigid temperatures of space. The key is to not make too many GHGs, which act like a blanket, reflecting the heat of the earth back onto it.

There is hope, he says, that the stigma around agriculture's impact on the environment will dispense. He contrasted two Times magazine stories that were 20 years apart. The older of the two warned against eating animal-source foods such as eggs and bacon because they were believed to cause health issues and heart attacks. The second shows a cover with the slogan, ""Eat Butter.""

""The attitude around ag changes,"" he said.

https://www.mediaite.com/news/watch-dem-candidate-does-stunned-triple-take-at-gop-congressmans-jaw-dropping-abortion-comment-during-live-debate/,WATCH: Dem Candidate Does Stunned Triple-Take At GOP Congressman’s Jaw-Dropping Abortion Comment During Live Debate,"Democratic congressional candidate Glenn Wright was visibly stunned when incumbent GOP Rep. John Curtis told voters, during a debate, that “I wish women could make this decision” about abortion.”

Abortion has become a much more central issue since the Supreme Court effectively overturned Roe v. Wade with the Dobbs v. Jackson decision, and has only escalated as more restrictions in states make news, and a national ban has been proposed by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham.

For example, Arizona passed a 15-week abortion, and on the eve of that ban taking effect, Pima County Superior Court Judge Kellie Johnson lifted a Roe-era injunction blocking a 19th-century law that dates back to 1864. Similarly, a Wisconsin ban that was enacted in 1849 was triggered into effect by the Dobbs decision.

The issue came up at Thursday night’s live debate for Utah’s 3rd congressional district, which Curtis won in 2020 by a mere 42 points. That’s probably why he felt comfortable saying what he did when the moderator asked for his answer to a Twitter user who asked “When do you feel there is an appropriate limitation on abortion?”

Watch for Wright’s stunned reaction when Curtis says “”I wish women could make this decision”:

Let me first start by saying I’m unapologetically pro-life. Now let’s discuss what the Supreme Court did and didn’t do. The Supreme Court, all they did was said there is no right to an abortion in the Constitution, which then pushed this issue down to the states.

Now, look, I get it. If you’re a woman, it stinks that most of these legislatures are men. Most of these decisions are made by men. I wish it were other than that. I wish, as a man, I didn’t have to make this decision. I wish women could make this decision.

And, that being said, it falls on state legislatures to thoughtfully decide in their state what they want to do. State legislators are responsible to the people in the state. There’s far more accountability on a state level than there is on a federal lever – level. Have you ever tried to get a federal law changed versus a state law? And as we watch this play out across the United States, I think you’re going to see legislatures take different positions. That’s the beauty of states rights. And as a federal legislator, I, quite frankly, believe that’s where it should be.

Wright’s rebuttal was brief.

“I think putting women in jeopardy in a significant portion of our states is not a good idea,” Wright said.

https://www.kgun9.com/news/local-news/ways-to-combat-seasonal-depression,Ways to combat seasonal depression,"TUCSON, Ariz. (KGUN). — The holidays are considered the most wonderful time of the year, but there are people who experience seasonal depression.

Stanley Popovich is a mental health advocate and author who specializes in fear and anxiety. Popovich has struggled with fear and anxiety for over 20 years and is now using his life lessons to pave the way for those going through mentally tough times, especially during the holidays.

Seasonal depression is actually called Seasonal Affective Disorder also known as SAD. Less sunlight and shorter days are thought to be linked to a chemical change in the brain and may be part of the cause of seasonal depression. Plus, the body naturally makes more melatonin when it's dark.

So, when the days are shorter and darker, more melatonin is made. But, mental health experts say if you are experiencing seasonal depression— the most important part is self-advocacy.

“If you just sit there and worry about what other people think and decide well I’m alone and I’m not going to do anything then your problems aren't going to go away and your anxiety and fears will just get worse,"" said Popovich.

Getting professional help, remaining active, getting outside and finding a positive group of people to be around, are simple steps that Popovich shared with me on how to temporarily combat seasonal depression. He understands counseling can be expensive, so he offers free services to help people get through a rough time of year, something that he is all-to-familiar with.

This time of year can also be a really stressful time financially and academically. There are local support services here in Southern Arizona to combat seasonal depression.

CJP heads 5-member bench to hear govt's contempt plea against Khan.

No one can be deprived of the right to protest, chief justice says.

SC orders PTI chief, his lawyers to submit answers by October 31.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected the federal government's request to immediately stop PTI chief Imran Khan's long march to Islamabad, with Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial advising the government to hold talks with the former prime minister.

The federal government filed a contempt of court plea against the PTI chairman in the Supreme Court over his long march to the federal capital.

In its petition, the government said, ""Imran Khan is making announcements to attack Islamabad"", which it claimed was a violation of a court order. It urged the apex court to direct the PTI chief to ensure the implementation of its orders related to protests and sit-ins.

A five-member bench, headed by CJP Bandial, comprising Justice Ijaz ul Ahsan, Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Yahya Afridi and Justice Sayyed Mazhar Ali Akbar Naqvi heard the plea today.

A day earlier, Khan said PTI will kick off its long march on October 28 (Friday) from Lahore.

The former prime minister said that all party workers, supporters and leaders will gather at Lahore's Liberty Chowk at 11am from where they will march towards Islamabad.

Today's hearing

In his arguments during the hearing, Additional Attorney General Aamir Rahman said that the reports of police and intelligence institutions have been reviewed.

The additional attorney general said that the court had first asked when did the PTI chief give a call for the long march.

He said that the court order came on May 25 at 6pm, while the announcement was made by Khan at 6:50pm and he made the second announcement at 9:54pm.

""The PTI had requested to stage a sit-in at the Srinagar Highway,"" he said. ""Khan had also announced to go to D-Chowk even before the court order.""

Rahman said that later PTI leaders Shireen Mazari, Fawad Chaudhary, Sadaqat Ali Abbasi, Usman Dar, Shahbaz Gill, and Saifullah Niazi also gave a call to party workers to arrive at D chowk.

Meanwhile, the court sought a response from Khan over the plea seeking contempt proceedings against him.

""From Khan's statement, it seems like he was informed about the court's orders as he said that the SC ordered removing barricades,"" the CJP remarked as he summoned the PTI chairman to clarify before the court who said what.

Rehman contended that Khan's latest call to reach D-chowk is a contempt of court, he said, while referring to the end of PTI's long march at Jinnah Avenue on May 26.

""Khan crossed the restricted area H9 and reached Blue Area where he ended the rally,"" he said.

The additional attorney general further stated that PTI lawyers Babar Awan and Faisal Chaudhry assured the court that they would not cross the restricted area.

At this, CJP Bandial said that Rehman's argument has some weight therefore it would be better to seek a response from those who assured.

'Not necessary'

During the hearing, Justice Bandial said that the reports have enough justification that Khan should submit an answer.

""Even if a notice is served, it is not necessary for Khan to appear,"" he said.

The chief justice added that the court doesn't want to make the headlines, it only wants the rule of law to prevail. ""One has to show up when a show-cause notice in the contempt case of civil nature is served,"" he added.

Justice Yahya said that the court cannot seek an answer from anyone without notice.

The court also directed to provide the police, ISI, and IB reports to Khan and said that the PTI chief should provide an answer in light of these reports.

The Supreme Court also sought answers from former premier's lawyers Babar Awan and Faisal Chaudhary.

""We are not issuing notice as of yet,"" said the CJP, adding that a notice would give an impression that the proceedings have started.

Meanwhile, Justice Yahya issued a show-cause notice to Khan according to the previous differing note.

The court ordered that the PTI chairman and his lawyers should submit an answer by October 31.

The court adjourned the hearing till October 31.

SC is 'not an executive'

Earlier during the hearing, AAG Rehman informed the court that there is a miscellaneous plea seeking orders for PTI to immediately stop the long march.

At this, CJP Bandial observed that the plea has now become effective as he has given the call to march.

However, Justice Afridi remarked that it would be better if the government takes back the plea for orders to stop the long march or it will have legal effects.

Meanwhile, CJP Bandial remarked that the SC is ""not an executive nor it wants to be one"". No one can be deprived of the right to protest, he added.

However, he stressed that the protest should be within the limits of laws.

""In the context of the facts, the violation of the affidavit needs to be looked at prima facie,"" the CJP observed, adding that the events of May 26 are not clear.

At this, the additional attorney general sought time to take new directives from the government regarding the plea, seeking orders to stop PTI's long march.

The court accepted the request, assuring the government that the court can be approached if any issue occurred before October 31.",Q4

Advocates will protest Gilead’s over its drug pricing and policies, including illegal restrictions the company placed on access to 340B drug pricing earlier this year for its branded hepatitis C treatments when covered entities use outside contract pharmacies.

According to a 340B Report article from March, Gilead became the 15th drug manufacturer to place unlawful restrictions on 340B contract pharmacy programs. Lawyers for the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) in both the Biden and Trump administrations have said these restrictions are clearly illegal, yet drug companies like Gilead forge ahead with the lawbreaking in search of even greater profits.

Moreover, according to the 340B Report, Gilead is now refusing to offer the 340B discount price for HIV drugs to providers who use contract pharmacies. Earlier this year, Gilead suddenly, dramatically increased the price that safety net providers pay for Descovy – a drug needed for both HIV treatment and HIV prevention.

The 340B drug pricing program is administered by the U.S. Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA). It has helped provide low-cost medications and better health outcomes for millions of Americans and the nonprofit clinics and hospitals that serve them. Safety net providers like Ryan White providers who serve patients living with HIV have the right under the 340B statute to purchase drugs for their patients at a discounted price. In March, Gilead put profits before patients by unilaterally imposing unlawful conditions on when and how it will give discounts for certain Hepatitis C drugs.

“We are fighting against Gilead’s greed to fatten their corporate pockets. Their money-making schemes not only impact community partners and providers but also patients, like myself. I am one of many voices of community advocates who stand against pharma greed. Gilead cares more about money than lives,” said Jesse Brooks, AIDS advocate and AHF mobilizer.

In response to Gilead’s (and others’) illegal restrictions on 340B access for higher profits, AHF also earlier this year asked Congress and the FDA to conduct a formal investigation of Gilead as well as increase scrutiny of the actions of pharmaceutical companies.

In conjunction with the week of Gilead protests October 24 through October 28,, AHF will also run a series of Gilead/Greediad ads in several Bay Area print and online publications. The Greediad advertisements will note that:

Gilead Sciences has made tens of billions of dollars from drug price gouging.

Gilead is infamous for charging $1000 for a single pill of the Hep C drug Sovaldi.

Gilead is being sued by thousands of HIV patients for knowingly selling an inferior drug until its patent ran out.

Gilead replaced the inferior drug with Biktarvy and has now slashed its patient assistance program.

Gilead has doubled the price they charge to safety net providers of their HIV prevention drug Descovy.

Gilead’s greed has no limit making them the poster child for drug company profiteering.

AHF mobilizers will be also deploying social media in real-time at many of these Gilead protests and will be using hashtags: #BadGilead – #PeopleBeforeProfit – #GreedyGilead

Former President Donald Trump may be facing headwinds within the Republican Party after the disappointing midterm elections, but in the killing fields of Nigeria embattled Christians long for his return.

“Since [Trump] left office, there is no one speaking for us anymore,” said a member of the Nigerian House of Representatives, Solomon Maren, to The Epoch Times.

“The American government under Trump made sure religious freedom was guaranteed in Nigeria,” said Maren, who represents a district of Plateau state in the Nigerian House of Representatives.

Maren and other opinion leaders interviewed by The Epoch Times bemoan the fact that the Biden administration does not acknowledge religious freedom is being violated in Nigeria.

Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari addresses the 76th Session of the U.N. General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York on Sept. 24, 2021. John Angelillo/Getty Images

More than 1,000 Nigerians were murdered for their faith in the first three months of 2022, and the nation witnesses more such deaths than the rest of the world combined, according to Open Doors , a human rights NGO.

Yet, the U.S. Department of State in November 2021 dropped Nigeria from its religious freedom watch list amid criticisms by global rights activists.

Nigeria was listed as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) in October 2020 by the Trump administration due to continued religious violations. Forceful Islamization A massacre in the town of Maikatako, 45 miles south of Jos, unfolded hours after President Muhammadu Buhari attended a ceremony to defer the 2023 presidential campaign of the ruling All Progressives Congress party in Jos.

“Each time President Buhari visits Plateau state, there are killings,” Maren said.

He added: “There were killings in March 2018 when Buhari visited and the Fulani attacked communities in Bokkos, Barkin Ladi, and Bassa [counties]. Many more instances exist in the past that suggest the terrorists want to prove they have the president’s backing and no one can challenge them,” said Maren.

“This is a systematic religious cleansing and annihilation of indigenous Christians toward land grab,” Maren said.

On Nov. 15, approximately 300 terrorists made a complex attack on the market town of Maikatako, killing 11 people. Hours later on the same day, another attack in the adjoining Folloh village—located one mile away—left one person dead, he added.

The attack in Maikatako saw at least 10 people injured and half of the village’s 50 brick houses razed, Maren said. ‘Political Interests’ Residents told The Epoch Times the terrorists were armed with assault rifles and streamed into the village from bush located two miles north of Folloh, and one mile from Maikatako.

“I would have said the United States should impose sanctions on Buhari for supervising the killings, but the people whom we are supposed to look up to were the same people who came to Nigeria and removed the country from the list of countries to watch for religious violations,” Maren lamented.

His colleague from Benue state, Mark Gbilla concurred: “More than anybody else, the United States should be in possession of all the intelligence regarding the attacks [in Nigeria].”

Gbilla, who represents Gwer constituency at the House of Reps., told The Epoch Times in a phone call, “It leaves one to be concerned about the intentions of the [Biden’s] government.” ‘Attacks Tripled’ “Since the United States removed Nigeria from the list of countries of particular concern, religious attacks have tripled,” said Rev. Joseph Hayab, the northern vice chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), to The Epoch Times.

Between January and October 2022, at least 4,020 Christians were killed in Nigeria by Islamic extremists , according to International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law (Intersociety), a local monitoring group.

This means as many as 420 Nigerian Christians were murdered each month for their faith—a rise from 372 deaths reported by Open Doors International last year.

“The actual death toll might be a lot higher,” said Hayab, who also heads the Baptist Church in Kaduna state.

Hayab met with U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken when he visited Nigeria in November 2021 and expressed his objection to the dropping of Nigeria’s CPC label. Religious Freedom Reputation “Trump as a person has his weaknesses but we have to give it to him for standing for religious freedom,” said Simon Mwadkwon, another member of the Nigerian House of Representatives who spoke to The Epoch Times.

“America has assumed the status of the world police, making sure that things go right. A credible [U.S.] president should be seen to have a human heart,” said Mwadkwon who represents Barkin Ladi/Riyom constituency in the Nigerian parliament.

Between Nov. 16–23, a series of armed attacks in the states of Plateau, Benue, and Enugu killed at least 36 Christians according to officials and media reports.

One of the latest attacks by Fulani terrorists targeted a farming village 45 miles south of Jos on Nov. 23.

At least nine people, including toddlers, were shot and hacked to death in Serr village located in the east of the Bokkos county, according to a former Speaker of the Plateau state House of Assembly, Titus Alams, who was born there.

Terrorists Storm Village “As usual, they burned many houses, cars, motorcycles, and food barns belonging to the residents,” said Alams in a phone interview. More than 20 other residents were injured in the evening raid on the hilltop town that displaced about 225 of the 250 residents, said Alams to The Epoch Times.“As usual, they burned many houses, cars, motorcycles, and food barns belonging to the residents,” said Alams in a phone interview.

According to witnesses an estimated 200 to 300 armed terrorists stormed the village shouting “Allahu’akbar” (God is great), said Rev. Iliya Mapak, a local pastor who witnessed the attack.

The terrorists overpowered Mapak’s team of 20 civilian volunteers who attempted to stop the invasion with their hunting rifles and homemade single-shot guns, according to Mapak.

Six of the defense volunteers were among nine bodies recovered from different locations in the town when the military arrived minutes after the terrorists had disappeared, he said.

The military was stationed at an outpost five miles from the village.

“The American government is really supposed to show that she cares, she does not want people to die, she wants to defend human rights and human rights defense should not be just rhetoric. It should be an action,” said Hayab.",Q4

https://www.wvtf.org/news/2023-11-29/suit-against-insulin-manufacturers-spurs-health-care-reform-in-virginia,Suit against insulin manufacturers spurs health care reform in Virginia,"Three Virginia localities have filed federal lawsuits claiming some of the country’s biggest insulin manufacturers and the companies that work with them conspired to control the drug’s price.

Attorney Mark Pifko is part of the Baron and Budd legal team involved in the suits filed in Arlington and Henrico counties and the city of Alexandria. He described the claims as alleging a price fixing scheme that’s impacted residents as well as the insurance premiums for those who are covered by county plans.

“Plaintiffs in the case allege that the manufacturers and PBMs colluded together and ultimately raised the prices that caused financial harm to people who have to pay for insulin products,” he said.

Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, act as a kind of middleman to help negotiate drug prices. They started as a good faith effort to coordinate with small businesses and insurance providers to help buy drugs: the more folks involved, the cheaper the drugs.

But Pifko said acquisitions and vertical integration saw drug makers and PBMs consolidate, and, according to the complaint, opened the door to a 10-fold increase in the price of insulin over the last 20 years.

“They’ve moved on from the core functions they were designed to do,” Pifko said.

The suits are inspiring one elected official to revisit health care costs during the next session. Northern Virginia Democratic Delegate Karrie Delaney was exposed to the range of insulin prices after her teenage daughter was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes two years ago.

“She sees it firsthand as someone who needs insulin and recognizes some people have easier access getting affordable insulin than others,” Delaney told Radio IQ.

The Delegate, whose district includes parts of Fairfax County, has worked in the legislature to increase access to insulin for years, including a bill that allows pharmacists to refill insulin prescriptions in emergencies. She said these new lawsuits might be good grounds to revisit the issue, including the creation of a new state board that would review and scrutinize the price of drugs for those in the commonwealth. She noted a similar effort made it out of the Senate last year but was killed by Republicans in the House.

“I think we’re better positioned this year to see that pass,” she said, suggesting it would be among the new Democratic majorities' efforts to reduce healthcare costs.

Any such effort to address the cost of insulin would be welcomed by national groups like the American Diabetes Association. The ADA’s Chief advocacy officer Lisa Murdock said an estimated 8.4 million Americans live with diabetes and affordability is an issue that disproportionately impacts already vulnerable populations like the elderly and communities of color.

“The American Diabetes Association has worked tirelessly at the state and federal levels to advance insulin co-pay caps and other policies that make diabetes treatment more affordable,” Murdock said.

Novo Nordisk, one of the manufacturer defendants named in the suit, said in a statement the price fixing claims are false and they plan to fight them in court.

They also said they’ve since dropped the price of their insulin product to $35 for those who qualify.

But Pifko says that price drop instead shows they could have been charging consumers less all along.

“That begs the question why you weren’t doing that 20 years ago and doesn’t rectify the past issue,” he said.

As for the future of the lawsuits suit, Pifko said they're likely to get transferred to a similar dispute in New Jersey federal court. And while monetary damages are still unclear, the attorney hopes any outcome will bring more sunlight to the sale of insulin.

“There’s middlemen in the process making a ton of money,"" he said of the PBMs. ""So, we hope these cases will increase transparency, show who’s making what kind of money. And the hope is that will result in a fairer market.”

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/27/us-midterms-rural-california-voters-election-officials-fear-for-safety,‘A madness has taken hold’ ahead of US midterms: local election officials fear for safety,"Inside the office of the Shasta county clerk and registrar of voters, which runs elections for about 111,000 people in this part of far northern California, Cathy Darling Allen can see all the security improvements she would make if she had the budget.

“We have plexi on the counter downstairs for Covid but that won’t stop a person. It’s literally just clamped to the counters,” the county clerk and registrar said. For about $50,000, the office could secure the front, limiting access to upstairs offices, she estimated. Another county put bulletproof glass in their lobby years earlier, she knew, something officials there at one point considered removing, though not any more.

Elections offices didn’t used to think about security in this way, Allen said. Now they can’t afford not to.

Following Donald Trump’s refusal to acknowledge his defeat in the 2020 presidential election, Allen says the once low-profile job of non-partisan local election official has transformed in counties like hers. A culture of misinformation has sown doubt in the US election system and subjected officials from Nevada to Michigan to harassment and threats. The FBI has received more than 1,000 reports of threats against election workers in the past year alone.

In California, officials in small, rural and underresourced counties such as Shasta say they are encountering hostility and aggressive bullying from residents who believe there is widespread voter fraud – many are inundating local elections offices with public records requests as part of a relentless quest to try to prove their claims.

Residents in Shasta county have tried to intimidate election workers while acting as observers, crowding around Allen during a tense election night confrontation in June, and visiting voters’ homes while claiming to be a part of an “official taskforce”. In north-eastern California’s Nevada county, the registrar-elect had to take out a restraining order against residents who harassed her and pushed their way into her office, assaulting a staffer, she said.

“It’s really an unprecedented time,” said Kim Alexander, the president of the non-partisan California Voter Foundation, a non-profit organization that works on improving election processes. “A colleague recently referred to it as a sort of madness that’s taken hold.”

‘This is our Tiananmen Square’

On a Tuesday in September, speaker after speaker went before the Shasta county board of supervisors decrying the “election fraud” they believed – without evidence – is taking place. Dressed in red, white and blue, the residents described their effort as a David-and-Goliath-like battle.

“It’s called a citizen’s audit and we’ve been going out and collecting the evidence that shows there is fraud in our process,” one speaker said. “This is our Tiananmen Square. We’re going to stand in front of the tanks and say no more to the machines.”

The group of residents casting doubt over Shasta’s elections is small but highly visible, and speaks regularly at county board meetings. They have filed dozens of public records requests to Allen’s office, showed up in large numbers for election observation, and even visited the homes of certain voters while wearing gear labeled “official voter taskforce” – an act that Allen said may amount to voter intimidation.

Their opposition comes amid broader political upheaval in this rural northern county, stemming from anger among some residents over Trump’s loss and pandemic restrictions and vaccine mandates imposed by California’s progressive government.

The anger coalesced into an anti-establishment movement, backed with unprecedented outside funding from a Connecticut millionaire and supported by the area’s militia groups, that led to the recall of a longtime county supervisor in February. Behavior seen during that election prompted Allen’s office to make security changes, including tracking everyone who enters the facility.

During the primaries in June, when the school superintendent, district attorney and sheriff were on the ballot, a crowd of observers tried to intimidate county staff, Allen said, and someone installed a trail camera outside the office, seemingly intending to monitor election workers. The sheriff stationed deputies outside the office. After four of the candidates backed by the anti-establishment group lost outright – Allen beat her opponent and was re-elected to her fifth-term – the candidates requested a hand recount.

The county’s use of Dominion voting machines, which Trump supporters have maligned as part of a false conspiracy theory that the company played a role in swinging the 2020 election for Biden, has drawn particular concern from residents who believe in widespread election fraud. Some of them have attempted to share content with Allen, such as 2000 Mules, a debunked documentary that has promoted false claims about voter fraud.

One high-profile figure in the election denial movement recently held a $20 event at a church in the area. The grandstanding from people making money from spreading debunked narratives around elections is particularly frustrating for Allen.

If there are problems around elections, she said, she would rely on the actual experts she knows who have worked in the field for decades and share information for free: “I guarantee you, they’re not gonna charge people 20 bucks a head at a church in Redding, California, to tell the story. That’s making you a dollar, that’s not trying to make anything better.”

Allen’s office has seen aggressive behavior and bullying, she said, but no threats yet. Given the threats elections officials across the US are facing, she suspects it’s only a matter of time.

“This is not what anybody signed up for,” she said. “I’ve had people tell me I should have private security. It’s not right. But it’s the world we live in right now.”

‘Just another form of harassment’

About 150 miles away in the Sierra Nevada foothills in eastern California, Natalie Adona said her office, too, was experiencing the same challenges: “If it’s happening in Shasta, chances are it’s also happening here. The loudest would-be disruptors of elections share information between our counties.”

Political tensions in Nevada county, which is home to about 100,000 people in historic towns and settlements that were at the center of California’s Gold Rush, have been rising since after the 2020 election, said Adona, the assistant county clerk recorder.

Earlier this year a group of residents attempted an aggressive and ultimately unsuccessful campaign to recall the entire board of supervisors, accusing them of enabling “crimes against humanity” for supporting Covid safety measures.

While running for her position this spring, Adona said she and her office were subjected to a months-long public harassment campaign, as well as racist language in an election mailer that featured a darkened photo of her and efforts to disqualify her over false claims that she failed to pay filing fees. After Adona won by nearly 70%, opponents requested a recount.

“I considered it to be just another form of harassment and I think one of the other purposes was to try to get at other documents that aren’t normally [obtainable] in the regular observation process,” she said.

At the same time, her office has received a flurry of public records requests in recent months that appear to be copy-and-pasted, Adona said: “What we’re today is either deliberate attempts to put a kink in elections process or just sort of an inundation of requests that really reflect how little the requestor knows about elections.”

Adona has also received one threat, she said, which was not actionable by law enforcement.

“It’s certainly not at the level of Georgia or Wisconsin. I do feel fortunate but at the same time a lot of it is unnerving,” she said.

The Nevada county office has increased its budget for security at its headquarters and is working more closely with law enforcement.

“I have the best job in the world. I get to serve voters, I get to serve the public but over the last few years election administration has become harder,” she said. “It’s raised a lot of questions for my team about how we keep in-person election workers safe, how do we keep our staff safe and at the same time offer the same levels of transparency in elections the public deserves.”

‘We haven’t had a break in about five years’

Across the US the climate has grown so tense that one in five election workers has said they are unlikely to remain in their positions through the next presidential election, according to a survey conducted by the Brennan Center for Justice. About one in six say they have been personally threatened.

Throughout California, small but vocal groups inspired by uninformed or malevolent actors, have been led to believe false narratives about how the state conducts elections, Alexander, of the California Voter Foundation, said, prompting the organization to make the safety of election workers increasingly a focus.

The group, along with the Brennan Center, recently sponsored legislation signed into law by the California governor that allows workers to keep their home addresses confidential.

“I never imagined when I started working on elections security almost 30 years ago that it would include the physical security of people who run our elections,” Alexander said.

But things have changed rapidly, she said. Her organization is trying to support election officials by providing de-escalation training and other resources to their offices. More help is needed, and has been for a long time.

“The chronic underfunding of election administration in the US is one of the conditions that led to the vulnerability of our election workers. If the offices weren’t understaffed and underresourced in the first place they would have more security,” she said.

California election offices were already challenged by back-to-back elections for the last few years, including 2021’s recall election of the governor. Months after that, Shasta county had its local recall election.

“We haven’t had a break in about five years,” said Allen, who is also on the board of directors for the California Voter Foundation. “None of my staff has been able to really disconnect – not for any length of time. I can’t even go to the top of Mount Lassen, where I know no one can get a hold of me.”

In the past, demystifying the election process with guided tours of the office and a walk-through of their procedures helped allay people’s fears, Allen said. This year, the office is attempting to fight against the tide of misinformation and disinformation with a steady trickle of good information publicized by her office through social media and webinars, she said, attempting to reach the voters they can. The county recently hired someone to work on voter education and outreach.

But as misinformation proliferates, there’s a growing contingency of people who won’t believe any message coming out of the office, she said.

“I don’t know how to dissuade people from a belief that they have swallowed wholesale like it’s a religion,” she said. “We’ll still try.”

Still, Allen remains hopeful things will get better. On a table in her office is a stack of thank you cards from residents expressing gratitude for her office’s work. She won re-election by a massive margin.

“In June, all the folks who believe in some of this bad information about election fraud and elections being stolen – six of those folks ran for office in June’s election – and none of them won. Not one of them,” she said. “To me, that’s the story: the voters of Shasta county saw through that.”

As far as the national challenges for election workers, “this too shall pass,” Allen said.

“I do think it’s going to get worse before it gets better – but it will get better,” she said.",Q4
https://www.city-journal.org/harris-county-judge-is-hottest-race-in-texas,Texas’s Hottest Race,"National pundits opining on Texas elections say that the governor’s race is the one to watch, pitting incumbent Republican Greg Abbott against his Democratic challenger, former congressman Beto O’Rourke. But Texans themselves are perhaps even more focused on the race for Harris County Judge—an elected office, whose occupant, despite the job title, serves as the de facto mayor of the largest county in Texas (third largest in the nation and home to Houston), which often finds itself in the crosshairs of Republican state lawmakers.

Thus far, the race has been a tug-of-war between national and local issues. The Democratic incumbent, Lina Hidalgo, has pressed the issue of abortion and gun control, despite her office’s lack of any oversight, legislative capacity, or regulatory authority on these issues. Her Republican opponent, Alexandra Del Moral Mealer, has campaigned on crime and public safety, stressing the county judge’s responsibility for overseeing the area’s criminal-justice system.

Hidalgo, a progressive political newcomer, won office in 2018, at just 27. The Stanford grad, with no political and limited professional experience, credited her win to the progressive advocacy groups Run for Something and The Arena. She was a longshot candidate by any standard, challenging popular Republican incumbent Ed Emmett. The race was expected to be an easy win for Emmett, but with Texas’s provision for straight-ticket voting and robust support in major urban counties for then-Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke, Hidalgo was swept into office. (Another factor in the incumbent’s loss was nearly 25,000 people voting for the Libertarian candidate.)

Prior to Hidalgo’s election, the county judge’s office dealt primarily with infrastructure, public safety, and natural disasters. Since taking office, however, Hidalgo has created nearly a dozen new departments, from the Office of Equity and Opportunity to the Office of Sustainability; assumed authority of overseeing local elections from two duly elected officials and appointed an elections administrator; and shifted the county’s day-to-day management to a newly created county administrator position, now the highest-paid position in Harris County government.

Critics claim that her ideological quest to expand the role of county government has come at the expense of her core responsibilities. But she has come in for the most criticism for her handling of public safety and a fractured relationship with local law enforcement. Hidalgo settled, rather than challenged, a bail-reform lawsuit, thus putting her at odds with the Harris County district attorney. She flirted with abolishing eight independently elected Constable offices. In a recent budget, she rejected 82 percent of law enforcement’s funding requests, and she stripped more than $3 million in savings from local law enforcement. She has also pursued a grab bag of progressive “public safety” initiatives, broadening the definition of the term to include investments like $50 million to mitigate neighborhood blight, $1.5 million for public Wi-Fi, $8 million for an early-impact fund, and $8.4 million for new bike trails.

Meantime, the county’s criminal-court case backlog exceeds 24,000 for misdemeanor cases and 18,000 for felony cases. As of July, the county jail was at 99.8 percent capacity with 81 percent awaiting trial, and homicides have surged 43 percent from 2019 to 2020.

Hidalgo has also drawn criticism over a county contract that resulted in the indictment of three of her senior staff. The county awarded a former Hillary Clinton for President and DNC staffer $11 million for Covid outreach. The one-person firm had no experience in health-care outreach, and the county waived certain requirements and bypassed better-equipped and lower-cost vendors. Public pressure forced Hidalgo to cancel the contract, but not before District Attorney Kim Ogg, a Democrat, opened an investigation into the procurement process. Ogg impaneled a grand jury that eventually charged three of Hidalgo’s senior aides, including her chief of staff, each with one count of misuse of official information and tampering with a government record. The three aides allegedly communicated with the firm and let the owner review the scope of the contract and revise the specifications a month before the proposal was made public for bidding. Hidalgo claims the prosecution is political and has kept her chief of staff in place, adding that she expects that she will be indicted, too.

Hidalgo’s opponent, Alexandra Del Moral Mealer, has tried to put the emphasis back on the role and responsibilities of the county judge office. A political newcomer herself, Mealer topped the first-round vote in the Republican primary and then beat her runoff opponent with 75 percent of the vote. She is a Harvard JD/MBA, a West Point grad, and an Afghanistan combat veteran who says she was drawn into the race because of rising crime and Hidalgo’s lack of urgency in addressing it. Mealer has won the support of roughly 20 public safety organizations in the region, as well as many of the mayors and council members from the cities within the county.

Hidalgo, meantime, seems to be struggling to garner the support of fellow Democratic elected officials. “I’m not seeing the strong support behind her by every Democrat,” Rice University Political analyst Mark Jones said. “There are a decent number of Democrats that are alienated by her.” Newly released fundraising numbers show Mealer raised $4.9 million, more than three times the amount Hidalgo pulled in, over a three-month span. Mealer also received the endorsement of the Houston Chronicle editorial board.

Politico called Hidalgo the “Democrats’ Future in Texas,” the Texas Observer called her the “Face of New Houston,” and she made the 2021 Time100 Next list with a glowing profile, penned by O’Rourke. She is arguably Texas Democrats’ greatest hope, but her failure to prioritize the basic responsibilities of her office could thwart that hope, especially as Hispanic voters in Texas continue to trend more conservative.

The most recent primary highlighted this electoral shift. In Starr County, where nearly the entire population is Hispanic, ballots cast in the March 2022 Democratic primary declined by 98 percent from the 2018 election. In Harris County, 27 percent of all new voter registrations by women were Hispanic. One pollster said, “that number didn’t break 1% a year ago.” The University of Houston’s July 2022 poll on local issues found that Harris County Hispanic voters’ top concerns were crime and public safety (82 percent) and government corruption (73 percent), which doesn’t bode well for Hidalgo.

In testimony before the County Commissioners Court, April Aguirre, the aunt of nine-year-old Arlene Alvarez, who was shot and killed in Harris County, criticized Hidalgo for her public safety policies. She ended her testimony by saying, “We voted for you Lina. We’re disappointed. We are Democratic people that are now shifting into the Republican world because the people that we voted for are not representing us properly.”

If enough voters share Aguirre’s concerns, Hidalgo’s desire to expand government at the cost of core services may precipitate her downfall—and that of her party’s hopes to turn Texas blue.

Investigators in Colorado Springs say a gunman armed with an AR-15 style rifle opened fire at Club Q, an LGBTQ nightclub. Five were killed and 17 were hurt.

The 22-year-old suspect is facing murder and hate crime charges.

Yet another attack targeting the LGBTQ+ community is resonating in San Francisco and especially the The Castro District, which is synonymous with gay culture.

""These are attacks against our community and we share the outrage and the grief,"" said Stephen Torres, Castro LGBTQ+ Cultural District chair. ""We have to be vigilant. We have to keep our eyes out for each other.""

Hate crimes against the LGBTQ+ community are on the rise.

Nonprofit Human Rights Campaign says one in five hate crimes across the country are motivated by anti-LGBTQ bias.

Some fear what happened in Colorado Springs could happen in San Francisco, given the rise in gun violence.

""A lot of us who used to go out at night…we’re not. We’re targets,"" said Tom Lappin. ""It’s going to happen again and again and again until they take assault weapons off the market.""

There’s also frustration and anger over hateful rhetoric playing out in politics, on television and social media.

""It’s not getting better, it’s getting worse,"" said Suzanne Ford, executive director of San Francisco Pride. ""We have to call that out everywhere. We cannot accept hate in any form and we’ve got to say if you vote for these people, if you subscribe to this messaging, then you’re part of the problem, too.""

This comes amid transgender awareness week.

Scott said more than three dozen trans people have been killed so far this year nationwide.

San Francisco Police Department says it has not received any credible threats of violence against the LGBTQ+ community, but officers are standing ready to respond to any emergencies.

The Castro Community On Patrol said it is stepping up efforts to make people feel safe.

LGBTQ+ Community leaders say it’s critical that people are united, unafraid to speak up, and promote love over hate.

""That’s how you combat this,"" Torres said. ""That’s how you combat fear, that’s how you combat terrorism.""

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2381943/by-polls-held-largely-peacefully,By-polls held largely peacefully,"Polling in by-elections for two National Assembly seats was largely held peacefully on Sunday, but the traditional enthusiasm was missing. Strict security arrangements were made for the by-polls in NA-237 (Malir) and NA-239 (Korangi), but scattered incidents of violence were reported at some polling stations.

Due to the absence of traditional hustle and bustle, the turnout remained low in the morning hours, while candidates, especially those belonging to PTI and PPP, accused each other of rigging.

The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had made good arrangements to ensure free and fair polls and the candidates appeared largely satisfied with arrangements at the polling stations. Despite lackluster morning polling, political parties and their workers managed to bring out their voters to the polling stations as the day progressed. An increase in turnout was seen at many polling stations between 12:30pm and 4pm.

In the rural areas of NA-237 (Malir), there was a rush at many polling stations. People from all age groups, including elderly, the disabled and women came out in large numbers to cast their votes. Polling agents of contestants guided the voters on voting procedures at their respective camps. The polling ended at 5pm in the evening.

Bilal Ghaffar injured

Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf I Karachi President Bilal Ghaffar was injured in an alleged attack in the Ghazi Goth area in the by-elections held in National Assembly Constituency NA 237 Malir in Karachi.

He was rushed to a private hospital I serious condition. PTI Sindh President Ali Zaidi along with lawyers has approached Malir City Police for FIR. PTI Sindh spokesperson Arslan Taj said in a statement that Ghaffar was attacked by, ""the thugs of PPP MPA Salim Baloch with the support of local police.""

Taj said Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has become a silent spectator to the bullying of PPP, while the ruling party in Sindh fearing its defeat was blatantly using government machinery to win the NA-237 seat.

""Our message to PPP is don't try our patience, if our workers get provoked, PPP will have no place to hide,"" Taj warned adding that PTI wanted conduct of polling process in a peaceful environment.

PTI leader Khurram Sher Zaman condemning the attack on Bilal Ghaffar said that the opponents should accept their worst defeat instead of attacking Imran Khan's people. It has become very difficult for the 15-parties coalition to win the by-elections. PTI people are being attacked and harassed. Every PTI worker including Bilal Ghaffar stand by with their leader.

Former Governor Sindh, Imran Ismail has condemned the attack on Bilal Ghaffar. The PPP workers (Jayalas) are scared of their defeat. Despite the presence of the police, Bilal Ghaffar was attacked and tortured.

Imran Ismail said that the gangster elements of PPP have been given free hand by the Sindh police. Unpleasant occurrences in elections are part of the rigging plan.

https://www.denverpost.com/2023/11/14/mollie-aspen-hotel-gin-luck-new-bar-restaurant-poolside-drinkery/,Death & Co. creators build restaurant at new MOLLIE Aspen hotel,"Venerable cocktail bar Death & Co. , which started in New York City before expanding to Los Angeles, Denver and Washington, D.C., has earned a reputation for its artfully crafted drinks that honor the history of bartending while infusing originality into recipes.

And soon, local fans of the brand will be able to try a new concept from its ownership group, Gin & Luck — if they’re willing to drive to a scenic Colorado mountain town.

The MOLLIE Aspen, a new boutique hotel slated to open in mid-December, tapped Gin & Luck to be the food and beverage operator for its onsite restaurant and bar, a lobby cafe, and rooftop terrace that features a plunge pool.

The food and drink offerings will not be carbon copies of Death & Co., but Gin & Luck CEO David Kaplan said they will maintain the same spirit people have come to expect from the company. Death & Co. has routinely earned accolades as one of the best and most influential bars in the country. The Denver location inside the Ramble Hotel landed on the inaugural list of the top 50 bars in North America last year.

“This is not Death & Co. Aspen, as much fun as that may be one day,” Kaplan said. “Our aspiration for this is to be a truly exceptional cocktail and dining establishment for Pitkin County.”

The MOLLIE hotel features 68 rooms and a chic, minimalist design that brings the outdoors inside with warm wood accents, a neutral color palette and lots of natural light. Kaplan and his team aim to distill the vibe of the physical space thoughtfully into menu items to create a “warm experience,” Kaplan said – bites and drinks that evoke the sensations of being cozily surrounded by stone, ceramic and wood.

For example, a White River Spritz cocktail that blends Alsatian white wine, Blanche Armagnac, elderflower, suze, and seltzer. Or a Summit Sour featuring locally-made Woody Creek bourbon, stone pine, raspberry, lemon juice, and egg white.

Dishes will spotlight seasonal local ingredients with nods to mountainside classics from other alpine regions. Much of the menu is still being finalized, guests can expect items like Wurst Bites (bratwurst and kielbasa with roasted cabbage and horseradish mustard) and lamb meatballs (Colorado lamb with soft polenta, a stout reduction and winter herbs).

The MOLLIE Aspen marks Gin & Luck’s fifth concept it operates behind Death & Co.’s four locations. The company plans to open a slew of new hotel bars in the next couple years under its newly founded group, Midnight Auteur Hotels.

28 October 2022 James Clayton & Peter Hoskins BBC News

The world's richest man, Elon Musk, has completed his $44bn (£38.1bn) takeover of Twitter, according to a filing with the US government. Mr Musk tweeted ""the bird is freed"" and later said ""let the good times roll"". A number of top executives, including the boss, Parag Agrawal, have reportedly been fired. Mr Agrawal and two other executives were escorted out of Twitter's San Francisco headquarters on Thursday evening, said Reuters. The completion of the deal brings to an end months of legal wrangling but it has prompted questions over the platform's future direction. A filing was made with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, confirming the takeover. The New York Stock Exchange said on Friday that trading in Twitter's shares had been suspended, giving the reason as ""merger effective"".

Chief financial officer Ned Segal, and the firm's top legal and policy executive, Vijaya Gadde, are leaving alongside Mr Agrawal, according to US media reports. Twitter co-founder Biz Stone appeared to confirm the executives' departure. In a tweet, he thanked all three for their ""collective contribution to Twitter"", calling them ""massive talents"" and ""beautiful humans"". Meanwhile, Bret Taylor - who had served as Twitter's chairman since last November - updated his LinkedIn profile to indicate that he was no longer in the post. Mr Musk, a self-styled ""free speech absolutist"", has been critical of Twitter's management and its moderation policies. They clashed over the terms of the takeover, with Mr Musk accusing Twitter of providing misleading information about the firm's user numbers. He has also said he would reverse bans on suspended users, which could include former US President Donald Trump, who was excluded following the Capitol riot in January 2021. At the time, Twitter said there was a risk Mr Trump would incite further violence. But Mr Musk has described the ban as ""foolish"". Earlier this week, Mr Musk said that he doesn't want the platform to become an echo chamber for hate and division. ""Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hell-scape, where anything can be said with no consequences!"" he tweeted. The takeover has prompted discussion among Twitter users over what the platform will look like under Mr Musk's ownership.

There are fears that more lenient free speech policies would mean people banned for hate speech or disinformation may be invited back to the platform. As well as Mr Trump, that could include political extremists, QAnon loyalists and Covid-19 deniers. In response to Mr Musk's missive, Thierry Breton the EU commissioner for the internal market tweeted ""In Europe, the bird will fly by our EU rules"" suggesting regulators will take a tough stance against any relaxation of Twitter's policies. Mr Musk as well as being the world's richest person with $250bn to his name, is a controversial figure. He made his fortune through the electric car company Tesla, and space exploration firm Space X. But he has drawn additional attention by his outspoken intervention in unrelated matters, often using Twitter as the platform, ranging from geopolitical issues such as the war in Ukraine to the rescue of the schoolboys trapped in a Thai cave.

It is not clear yet whether the clear out of senior management is the forerunner to company-wide job cuts. Earlier reports suggested 75% of staff at the social media company were set to lose their jobs but those reports were ""inaccurate"", according to Ross Gerber, a shareholder in both Twitter and Mr Musk's other company Tesla. ""There are a lot of talented people at Twitter, especially on the engineering side and they want to retain as much of that talent as possible,"" Mr Gerber told the BBC. But he said the job losses could nevertheless extend far beyond upper management. Mr Musk might look to cut product managers and end projects ""that aren't going anywhere"" he said.

A long road

Until recently it appeared the deal could still fall through. After building a stake in Twitter at the start of the year, Mr Musk made his $44bn offer in April, a price tag that looked too high almost as soon as it was agreed. He said he was buying it because he wanted ""civilisation to have a common digital town square"" and said he planned to clean up spam accounts and preserve the platform as a venue for free speech. But by the summer he had changed his mind about the purchase, citing concerns that the number of fake accounts on the platform was higher than Twitter claimed.

Eventually Twitter executives took legal action to hold Mr Musk to his offer and while he recently admitted he and the other investors involved in the deal were ""overpaying for Twitter right now"", the deal does now appear to have gone through. But speculation continues around Mr Musk's intentions for the platform.

Change ahead

Earlier this week, he changed his Twitter profile to read ""Chief Twit"" and some observers believe he will take the reins at the firm himself. Mr Musk also tweeted a video of himself walking into Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco carrying a sink with the caption: ""let that sink in!"" There has been no comment yet from Twitter about its new management team. But whoever becomes its next chief executive, it is clear that Mr Musk will ultimately be in charge of the company - a role he will have to balance with his management positions at both Tesla and SpaceX.

https://roanoke.com/news/local/casey-mail-delivery-halted-because-of-dogs-loose-on-a-roanoke-street/article_596b8714-7fe5-11ed-9d90-87c949b6e950.html,CASEY: Mail delivery halted because of dogs loose on a Roanoke street,"Some residents of northeast Roanoke are experiencing what you might call a mail-delivery conundrum. The holiday season is a rotten time for that.

They live on Northridge Street, near Monterey Elementary. Roanoke’s postmaster has declared a two-block stretch of that road off-limits for deliveries — because of repeated run-ins between a mail carrier and some unleashed dogs.

Residents say the incidents date to August. The dogs in question are four pets that belong to two households on the street. According to city police, two of the dogs are pit bulls.

Resident Jane McDaniel said she’s called animal control repeatedly. Although Roanoke has a leash law, and officers have called upon the homes where the dogs reside, neither owner has stopped their dogs from getting loose, McDaniel said. And neither owner has been cited.

“I’ve called the dogcatcher 10 times this year,” McDaniel said. (Some other neighbors didn’t want to be quoted by name because they said they’re concerned about the potential for retribution.)

Pet dogs running loose are a violation of Roanoke’s leash law. It requires a pet to be under its owner’s control at all times. A violation may result in a citation.

But police say they can’t take action in this specific case until one of the dogs bites someone or unless officers personally observe the pets running loose off their owners’ property. So far, neither of those conditions has been met, said Roanoke Police Lt. Susanna Camp.

Meanwhile, Roanoke’s Animal Protection and Services Unit has stopped responding to stray animal reports because it’s severely short staffed.

Currently the unit has three filled warden positions and four unfilled vacancies, Camp said. The unit’s online homepage says the short-staffing “impacts our ability to provide the best service possible to the animals of this city.”

So currently, residents of the 4400 and 4500 blocks of Northridge are picking up their mail at the main post office on Rutherford Avenue.

“Absolutely, that’s an inconvenience,” said Pamela Shaver, who also lives on Northridge. “I’m having to leave work early so I can get to the post office before it closes at 6.”

The first mail-service interruption this year happened in August, McDaniel said. She and her neighbors lost mail delivery for about a month. Initially, McDaniel was unaware why.

McDaniel finally learned the reason from Shaver. Last summer, Shaver received a notification to pick up a package at the Postal Service’s Courtland Road annex. That’s when she learned regular mail service had been temporarily stopped because of dogs that had frightened the carrier.

Shaver confirmed that account; McDaniel said deliveries resumed after about a month. During the interim, she picked up her mail about once a week at Courtland.

McDaniel said the postal carrier also visited her house in August personally, and told her he’d been seriously attacked three years ago.

“He said something had to be done because he was not going to risk his well-being because of dogs running loose,” she told me.

That’s totally understandable. Dog bites are serious matters, and pit bulls can be especially frightening.

Deliveries stopped again after the Dec. 3 incident. McDaniel said she had a conversation with the letter carrier then, too. It happened immediately after he pepper-sprayed the dogs in question.

He said, “it’ll be months before you get your mail delivered,” McDaniel told me. “He said, something’s got to be done.”

Though initially reported as an “attack,” Camp said the letter carrier was not bitten Dec. 3. Rather, he deployed pepper spray after the dogs began chasing him, Camp said. Then he reported the incident to both the Postal Service and police.

It was one of seven animal-related calls since Aug, 1 from the two blocks in question, said Roanoke police spokeswoman Caitlyn Cline.

After the Dec. 3 incident, McDaniel and other residents received a nine-paragraph letter, dated Dec. 8 and sent by certified mail, from Roanoke Postmaster Angela Jones. Most of it is form-letter boilerplate.

One of thing things it notes is that, on average across the country, roughly 15 Postal Service letter carriers are bitten by dogs every day.

5 dogs fatally attack Florida postal worker when her truck breaks down, officials say A 61-year old postal carrier died after being attacked by five dogs in rural northern Florida over the weekend, sheriff's officials said.

Near the end is a bolded paragraph that specifically addresses the situation on Northridge Street.

“A mail carrier was attack [sic] in your neighborhood on December 3, 2022,” the paragraph reads. McDaniel was among the homeowners who received it.

“This is the third instance of a serious attack on the mail carrier and can no longer be tolerated,” Jones wrote in the letter. “The United States Postal Service is gathering information from animal control and [sic] police department to determine a remedy to this problem for the safety of the mail carrier.”

The letter went on to say, “Mail delivery in your neighborhood is temporarily interrupted until a safe remedy can be found to resume delivery … You will receive a letter of the next course of action within 30 days of receipt of this letter.”

Campo said the police department received a flurry of calls after residents received the letter.

Back in August, not getting mail daily was “was not that big of a deal,” McDaniel told me. “This time of year, we have Christmas. We’ve ordered things online we’re not getting.”

Monday, I emailed a Postal Service spokesman about the problem, after I’d called four numbers for Roanoke’s postmaster, all of which went unanswered.

Spokesman Philip Bogenberger said mail delivery would resume on Northridge when it’s clear the carrier could deliver the mail there safely.

Jones’ letter, meanwhile, broached two potential solutions, neither of which McDaniel finds palatable.

One is that residents of Northridge could individually install mailboxes on posts at the street in front their homes, so the mail could be delivered from the safety of a vehicle. The other option is to install a single large bank of mailboxes like some apartment complexes have, with locked slots accessible by key.

Both solutions would cost residents money and are unacceptable, McDaniel said.

Camp offered another solution that sounds like a better short-term option. She said residents of the street could visit a magistrate and themselves charge the dog owners with violating the leash law, if they have personally witnessed infractions.

Perhaps a fine would get the owners’ attention.

“We really need the neighbors to partner with us, and press the charges,” Camp told me.

Maybe that will happen soon. The uproar on Northridge Street is growing.",Q4

Hugh Hootman, 75, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Henry and Ginger Wallace, both 81. Police say he shot both of them in the chest just outside their apartment.

""We got the call at 3:18 p.m. and we happened to be very close to that apartment,"" Martin County Sheriff William Snyder told TCPalm. ""We had several SWAT team members there because they were getting ready to go out to the Hobe Sound parade for security.""

One person is in custody after they shot two people to death late afternoon Saturday at the Cedar Pointe Condominiums off East Ocean Boulevard.

A homeowners association dispute was the apparent motive in the shooting, Synder said.

""Ginger was the president of that HOA of that building,"" Snyder said. ""And it does appear to us from witness statements that the shooter and Ginger had some disagreement over HOA issues. I don't know what those were, though.""

The couple had also gotten in an argument with Hootman just days before the shooting, Snyder added.

Henry Wallace was found with keys in his hand, Snyder said, adding that the couple was found on the sidewalk ""not far from their front door"" and could have been heading toward nearby mailboxes.

When deputies arrived, neighbors told them that Hootman was in his upstairs apartment.

""Less than 20 minutes after arrival, he then walked out of the apartment and surrendered,"" Snyder said.

One person is in custody after they shot two people to death late afternoon Saturday at the Cedar Pointe Condominiums off East Ocean Boulevard.

The shooting was a shock for nearby neighbor Joanne Ryder, a snowbird from New York who moved to Cedar Pointe earlier this year.

""I saw her around 3 p.m. that day,"" Ryder recalled. She said the Wallaces were from New Jersey. ""I had a tool of hers and I was walking across the parking lot to give it to her. She came out of the house and she was all bubbly and very happy.""

Ryder then left to run some Christmas shopping errands and came home to multiple police cars outside, crime scene tape covering the Wallaces' unit and other neighbors congregating outside.

""I had a lot of respect for the woman. She had to deal with a lot as the president,"" Ryder said. ""She was only doing her job, and in the short amount of time that I knew her, she was so helpful to me.""

The condo board was going to host a tree lighting and barbecue Saturday evening, but that never happened, according to Ryder. Just the night before, Ginger went Christmas caroling, she added. And the day before the shooting, Ryder saw the Wallaces happily tanning at the pool.

Henry Wallace was quiet, and loved to ride his bicycle around the condo complex, Ryder said.

""This is a retirement community ... you don't expect something like this to happen. It's a real tragedy,"" Ryder said. ""Now (police) have to notify the family that both parents were killed before Christmas. That's horrible.""

Hootman was being held Sunday at the Martin County Jail without bail.

The shooting comes four years after a fire tore through the roof of one of the 10-unit condominiums. That building in the 55-plus community was left uninhabitable after the Memorial Day blaze, but was being reconstructed in 2019.

The slaying of the Wallaces was the third shooting that happened in Martin County on Saturday, Snyder said.

Ri'ahj Lee Thomas, 20, of Fort Pierce shot a man in the leg around 10 a.m. Saturday at the Indian Run Apartments off Southeast Indian Street, police said. Thomas fled the scene and police said Sunday they are looking for him.

The other shooting occurred around midnight Saturday in the 3800 block of Northwest Windemere Drive in Jensen Beach.

A 14-year-old boy accidentally shot his friend, another teenager, with a revolver. The teen was treated for his injuries and discharged from the hospital, according to Stuart Police Lt. Michael Gerwan. No charges are being pressed, he added.

""It is unusual to have that many shootings here, but they weren't related,"" Snyder said. ""They were outliers. This does not indicate a widespread threat to our community.""

The massive bronze rendering, a jovial depiction of Till in slacks, a dress shirt and a tie with one hand on the brim of his hat, is at the heart of Rail Spike Park in Greenwood. The area will be called Emmett Till Square at Rail?Spike Park. It will be just a few miles away from the Leflore County Courthouse, which is also the site of a monument featuring a group of Confederate soldiers.

An event worker removes the tarp of the Emmett Till statue during its unveiling, Friday, Oct. 21, 2022 in Greenwood, Miss.

Till’s statue is near Grocery & Meat Market in the hamlet of Money, where the teen first crossed paths with Carolyn Bryant Donham. She later told her husband and owner of the country store, Roy Bryant, that Till harassed her, triggering a deadly reaction that would go on to spark the Civil Rights movement.

Enraged by 14-year-old Till’s violation of an unwritten behavior code in the Jim Crow-era south, Roy, and his half-brother J.W. Milam, abducted the teen the night of Aug. 28, 1955. They beat and mutilated him before shooting him in the head and sinking his body in the Tallahatchie River. His bloated body was found and pulled from the water days later.

An undated portrait shows Emmett Till, a black 14-year-old Chicago boy, who was brutally murdered near Money, Mississippi, Aug. 31, 1955, after whistling at a white woman.

At the time of his violent death, Till, a native of Chicago, had been visiting family in the Mississippi Delta. His mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, hosted an open casket funeral in his home city so that others could see the horrors her son had faced.

Neither of his killers were ever punished. Both men were acquitted by an all-white jury, though they later confessed to the brutal crime.

Greenwood and Leflore County are both more than 70% Black and officials have worked for years to bring the Till statue to the area. Democratic state Sen. David Jordan of Greenwood secured $150,000 in state funding, allowing officials to commission Utah-based artist Matt Glenn to create the rendering.

Audience members reach forward to touch and photograph the Emmett Till Memorial Statue following its unveiling, Friday, Oct. 21, 2022, in Greenwood, Miss.

The unveiling on Friday comes a week after the release of “Till,” a movie focusing on Till-Mobley’s private trauma over her son’s death and how it moved her to become an advocate for civil rights.

A life-sized bronze statue of Till-Mobley is slated to go up in the Chicago suburb of Summit. The groundbreaking is scheduled for Oct. 28 at a plaza outside Argo Community High School, where she was an honor student. The statue is scheduled to be in place by late April.

https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/ntsb-confusion-over-fixed-firefighting-system-added-to-towboat-damage,NTSB: Confusion Over Fixed Firefighting System Added to Towboat Damage,"A serious engine room fire aboard the towboat Capt. Kirby Dupuis escalated because the crew did not know how to activate its fixed firefighting system, according to the NTSB.

On November 9, 2021, the towing vessel Capt. Kirby Dupuis was pushing thirteen barges upbound on the Ohio River near Belleview, Kentucky. At about 0708, the master saw a flash of light on the video monitor for the engine room, and the fire alarm sounded. The captain activated the general alarm and told the crew to begin firefighting.

The ""deckineer"" - a deckhand who had not yet qualified as an engineer but was performing the vessel's engine-room duties - tried to enter the space to fight the fire, but was turned back by heat and smoke. He tried to start the firepump using a remote switch, but it did not work, likely due to fire damage to the electrical switchboard. He requested and received permission to activate the towboat's Novec 1230 fixed firefighting system to put out the blaze.

Following procedure, he activated remote fuel shutoffs, secured engine room hatches and ventilation, and pulled one of the two remote activation levers for the Novec fire suppression system. The fire did not go out, and he did not hear any activation sirens for the fixed firefighting system (a built-in safety feature). After spraying a number of fire extinguishers into the space and seeing the flames growing, he pulled the second of the two levers, and he believed that the firefighting system operated properly to put out the blaze after the second pull.

The vessel was evacuated by other nearby towboats, which provided boundary cooling until a fireboat arrived at 0900. The fire was out by 1300, with assistance from multiple fire departments.

The fire burned through the upper and lower engine room, causing an estimated $1.8 million in damage. A post-accident review of the engine room video determined that the source of the fire was a spray of lubricating oil from the port main engine. A service manager from the engine OEM inspected the engine and found a broken o-ring, located just below a joint on a lube oil supply tube. The tube's retaining ring was missing, along with the supporting clips and mounting hardware to hold the tube in place. The manager concluded that a pressurized spray of lube oil had hit the exhaust manifold and ignited, then the air duct above the engine had blown the fire horizontally across the compartment.

The cause for the missing mounting hardware was not determined, but a fleetwide inspection found that 10 percent of similar engines needed attention and correction.

Marine inspectors who examined the vessel after the accident found that the fixed firefighting system had never activated. Two pull levers needed to be pulled in order to set the system in action; the deckineer had pulled one, resulting in no effect, and had then returned later and pulled the other one part way. The extinguishing fluid and propellant remained in their cylinders. A technical test of the system determined that it functioned as designed.

The NTSB found that though the operating company had a thorough SMS and conducted extensive onboard training, its drills did not include familiarization with the fixed firefighting system. The operator is introducing a training module to cover this area.

""During interviews, the deckineer did not display a confident understanding of the overall operation of the system. Had the crew been more familiar with the system, and activated it properly, the system would have shut down the engines and ventilation fans before a complete release of both cylinders of suppression fluid into the engine room and may have quickly extinguished the fire,"" concluded NTSB.

MSU students still in line to vote hours after polls at East Lansing satellite office close

Michigan State University students waited in line for hours at the East Lansing City Clerk’s satellite office inside Brody Hall to register to vote with their East Lansing address and cast their ballots for the Nov. 8 General Election.

MSU psychology freshman and first-time voter Logan Walters got in line at 6:15 p.m. and was still waiting at 10:30 p.m. Walters said there was not a specific issue that brought him to the polls.

Political science junior Aarian Driskell waited in line for over three hours, and she said that there was nothing that would make her leave after that point. The pre-law student said she was drawn to vote on abortion issues this election.

“I’m not pro-life or pro-choice, but there are some things where it’s just like–that’s just not okay,” Driskell said.

Social relations and policy senior Beija McCarter and pre-law freshman Alena Walker volunteered with Michigan United handing out water and food to encourage people to stay in line.

“I wanted to make sure that every student knows that they have a voice and that it needs to be heard,” McCarter said. “A lot of times, students don’t vote because things like this happen where it’s really difficult. It’s 10:30, people want to go home, but it’s really important that people get their voice heard–especially our generation.”

In-person voting in East Lansing high, but not same as pre-pandemic elections

Poll workers and observers across East Lansing say that in-person voter turnout was higher than expected, but still hasn’t returned to pre-pandemic levels.

No major issues or bottlenecks came up the morning or afternoon of Tuesday, though many Michigan State University students did have to go to the city clerk satellite office in Brody Hall to fix issues with their registration before they could vote at their assigned precinct.

Poll workers at some on-campus precincts, such as the MSU Union, said they had sent as many voters to the Brody clerk as they had successfully processed. Others at off-campus locations like the Martin Luther Chapel reported under 10 percent of voters having registration issues. The poll workers said all locations had major turnouts.

A key message among candidates this year was spurring young people to vote. Poll workers in East Lansing said that while more young voters came out than previous years, the total in-person numbers within the age group have not returned to pre-pandemic levels.

East Lansing Film Festival opening night sets tone for week-long indie film exploration

On opening night of the silver anniversary of the East Lansing Film Festival, or ELFF, on Nov. 3, community members filled Studio C at Celebration Theater for the local tradition.

Festival director Susan Woods hosted an opening night party, where she was surrounded by festival goers from the last 25 years. She sees these community members as very dear friends.

One of the annual festival enthusiasts, Martha Couretas, sees ELFF as a cultural haven in her small community. She views films every year that she wouldn’t be able to see anywhere else and finds Michigan filmmakers enlightening.

The opening film was “Bad Axe,” It’s namesake is the rural, conservative Michigan town it was filmed in. The film follows an immigrant family during the depths of the pandemic, combating economic hardship with their family business, racism in their small town and an attempt to keep their family ties close. David Siev, the director, made the movie as a love letter to his family and his hometown.

The autobiographical documentary has already had a successful film festival run, with awards from the Detroit Free Press and the South by Southwest Film Festival. It has won 17 awards and has been projected as an Oscars contender.

Julia Field, an audience member, thought the film was heartwarming, yet also representative of the hardship of the pandemic.

The second film of opening night was “Jacir,” a feature film depicting the main character, Jacir, and his journey from Syria to America.

ELFF will run until Nov. 10. A schedule of the films can be viewed on The State News website.

Defending himself in his departmental trial at NYPD Headquarters Wednesday — the agency’s first Hasidic officer — Lt. Joel Witriol said there was so much chaos and fighting going at the June 14, 2020, protest at the corner of E. 136th St. and Brook Ave. in Mott Haven that anything could have happened.

But he’s absolutely sure he didn’t purposefully stomp on the face of a woman protesting the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer.

Joel Witriol on Sept. 5, 2014.

“There’s a difference between chaos and doing something on purpose,” Witriol explained. “Nothing was done on purpose.

“I did not kick her on purpose, and I don’t believe I kicked her at all,” he said.

But the Civilian Complaint Review Board substantiated abuse-of-force charges against Witriol for assaulting the woman, identified as Alexandra Huber, while she was down on the ground.

Body camera footage and medical reports all conclude Witriol kicked Huber while she was being subdued for not complying with former Mayor de Blasio’s 8 p.m. curfew order, CCRB officials said.

The most damning piece of evidence was the body-worn camera footage from another officer which shows Witriol stomping on the ground followed by a woman’s scream, Nicole Jardim of the CCRB’s Administrative Prosecution Unit said. The footage doesn’t actually show Huber getting hit.

“[Witriol’s] looking straight down at her. He lifts his leg up and he stomps,” Jardim said, describing the video during the one day departmental trial.

Huber suffered a black eye and a cut on her nose and was too traumatized to testify in person Wednesday.

If a department judge finds Witriol guilty of abuse of force, he could be fined 20 vacation days.

The lieutenant said the footage doesn’t show a stomping, but him losing his balance because of the “oil, water and urine” protesters were throwing at cops.

“I had just been maced,” Witriol said. “I felt it in my mouth all night.”

He claimed he did grab Huber and attempted to place her under arrest for violating the curfew. He admits to swing her around, but said he never knocked her to the ground and kicked her.

Instead he handed her to other cops who took her down with a leg sweep.

“She was still resisting when I handed her off,” said Witriol, who admits that he never turned his body-worn camera on during the protest.

“I made no contact with her head,” he said.

Huber quickly hired a lawyer and plans to sue the city, Witriol’s attorney Marissa Gillespie said.

“She wasn’t too traumatized to get a civil attorney,” she said.

Witriol joined the NYPD in 2006 and quickly moved up the ranks. In 2016, he was promoted to lieutenant and was transferred to the Housing Bureau, where he was named the integrity control officer for Public Service Area 7.

He raced over to the protest after hearing several pleas for backup over the radio. Two vehicles with guns and Molotov cocktails were intercepted on their way to join with the demonstrators, he remembered.

Protesters said cops herded them into the corner near the Millbrook Houses and struck them with batons. Video of the event shows cops swinging batons and roughly shoving people, many of whom were begging to go home, freelance photographer Gregory Berg, who was caught in the crowd, told The News.

“I got maced, a 75-year-old man got maced, a pregnant woman got maced,” Berg said. “They slammed us into cars, cuffed us and left us on the street. It was some third world s–t.”

Police Commissioner Dermot Shea acknowledged the cops’ aggressive handling of some in the crowd afterward — and said that the protest had been infiltrated by “outside agitators” who were looking to use the event as cover to loot the neighborhood.",Q4
https://www.fijitimes.com/u-s-judge-rejects-biden-administrations-lgbt-health-protections/,U.S. judge rejects Biden administration’s LGBT health protections,"(Reuters) – A federal judge in Texas ruled on Friday that President Joe Biden’s administration had wrongly interpreted an Obamacare provision as barring health care providers from discriminating against gay and transgender people.

U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in Amarillo ruled that a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2020 holding that a law barring workplace discrimination protects gay and transgender employees did not apply to the healthcare law.

The ruling by Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former Republican President Donald Trump, came in a class action lawsuit by two doctors represented by the America First Legal Foundation, set up by former Trump White House adviser Stephen Miller.

They sued after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in May 2021 it would interpret Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which bars healthcare providers from discriminating on the basis of sex, as extending to sexual orientation and gender identity.

Kacsmaryk said Congress, when adopting the law, known as Obamacare, in 2010, during the tenure of former Democratic President Barack Obama, could have included “sexual orientation” or “gender identity” in the text, but “chose not to do so.”

Instead, the law incorporated the bar against discrimination “on the basis of sex” in Title IX, a 50-year-old federal civil rights law that bars such discrimination in education programs.

Kacsmaryk said the logic of the Supreme Court’s 6-3 conclusion that Title VII’s bar against sex discrimination covered gay and transgender workers did not lead to the same result under Title IX’s text.

“Title IX’s ordinary public meaning remains intact until changed by Congress, or perhaps the Supreme Court,” Kacsmaryk wrote.

HHS and the plaintiffs’ lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Obama administration introduced rules in 2016 that made clear that LGBT people would be protected under the healthcare discrimination provision.

But those protections were reversed by a Trump-era rule finalized in 2020. In June, the Biden administration proposed a rule to once again enshrine such protections.",Q4
https://www.uspresidentialelectionnews.com/2022/12/new-dem-primary-schedule-would-help-joe-biden-in-2024/,New Dem Primary Schedule Would Help Joe Biden in 2024,"There’s nothing like stacking the deck in your favor to avert a potential upcoming primary challenge.

While the Democratic National Committee (DNC) is engaged in shaking up its presidential primary calendar, President Biden is busy working to make sure he will be the main benefactor if he chooses to run again in 2024. If you recall, Biden lost the first two contests in 2020 with Pete Buttigieg winning Iowa and Bernie Sanders winning in New Hampshire. Biden, in fact, came in fifth place in the Granite State, a result that caused some analysts to predict he wouldn’t even make it to South Carolina.

Then came the 2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses where Bernie Sanders again came away the victor with Biden taking a distant second place. It was not until the South Carolina primary that Biden stomped Sanders and took the first place spot in an easy win, a result that basically propelled his open path to the nomination. The reason for Biden’s southern win was thanks mostly to black voters who make up half the electorate in the Democratic primary.

Needless to say, Biden would like to skip all the nonsense of the first three contests and move South Carolina directly to the head of the line for Democrats in 2024:

At a meeting in Washington, a key panel at the Democratic National Committee approved the proposal, which was put forward by President Joe Biden a day earlier. The only dissent came from representatives of Iowa and New Hampshire. The overhaul calls for South Carolina to hold its Democratic primary on Feb. 3, followed by Nevada and New Hampshire on Feb. 6. Georgia would hold its primary on Feb. 13, with Michigan rounding out the early voting on Feb. 27. The new calendar still faces hurdles before it is adopted. Numerous states were caught off guard by the White House proposal, which makes more dramatic revisions than had been expected.

We reported previously that Biden was pushing behind the scenes to move up South Carolina and now those reports have been confirmed. The new calendar would look something like this assuming the states all play along:

Proposed 2024 Democratic Primary Schedule

South Carolina (Feb. 3) Nevada, New Hampshire (Feb. 6) Georgia (Feb. 13) Michigan (Feb. 27)

Notice the lack of Iowa? That’s for a reason. The state’s too white and rural according to Democrats.

The only wrinkle in the plan appears to be whether Republican officials in Georgia, where the state controls the primary calendar, will play along and agree to move the primary in line with the DNC proposal.

Furthermore, Nevada and New Hampshire would basically be sharing a day, something early states usually aren’t keen on doing since they lose their unique and individual spotlight. Forcing campaigns to divide their time between New Hampshire and Nevada will basically leave the Granite State out in the cold, so to speak. There would be a divide in the field of candidates heading to whichever state they stand the best chance in.

The other glaringly obvious fact, however, is that the calendar would heavily benefit Joe Biden and Kamala Harris:

The Biden calendar, approved by a key panel of the Democratic National Committee Friday, would put South Carolina first among a set of five states sanctioned to hold early primaries. It would be followed by New Hampshire and Nevada on the same day, then Georgia and finally Michigan. Iowa would be kicked out of both the top spot and the first five. The new calendar would be “good for the Biden-Harris ticket,” said Karen Finney, a veteran Democratic strategist who urged Biden to choose a Black woman as his running mate in 2020.

This is basically Biden repaying his friends in South Carolina for rescuing his 2020 campaign off life support. Nothing is official yet until the full DNC votes on the change in full but some states have vowed to hold early contests anyway, bucking the national party:

The full DNC must still vote on Biden’s proposal early next year, and officials in Iowa and New Hampshire say they will hold their contests before other states no matter what penalties the DNC applies to line-jumpers or candidates who campaign in rogue states.

This fight isn’t over yet for Iowa and won’t be settled until next year. By the time 2024 rolls around, however, Iowa may be forced to choose between holding an early contest, accepting a penalty of reduced delegate numbers, or getting in line with the new primary voting order.",Q4
https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/11/kentucky-judge-blocks-bills-stripping-power-from-gov-andy-beshear/69638415007/,Kentucky judge blocks two GOP bills seeking to strip Gov. Andy Beshear's power,"Franklin Circuit Judge Thomas Wingate issued a ruling Thursday to strike down two bills passed by Republicans in the 2022 legislative session that Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear sued to block as unconstitutional.

The bills were two of many that the Republican supermajority has passed over the past several years to limit the powers of the governor or shift those powers to other constitutional officers, all of whom are currently Republican.

The first bill Wingate struck down and permanently enjoined was House Bill 388, which would have allowed the state treasurer to be the final arbiter of state contracts, instead of the secretary of the Finance Cabinet within the Beshear administration.

Under current state law, the Government Contract Review Committee, made up of legislators, can recommend canceling personal service contracts, tax incentive agreements and memoranda of agreement, but the Finance secretary is free to either uphold or overrule that recommendation.

More:Here's where all of Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear's 2022 vetoes stand

Beshear vetoed the bill, arguing it violated separation of powers provisions of the constitution by allowing a legislative body to have final say over executive branch contracts when not in session. That veto was overridden, after which Beshear sued.

Wingate also struck down a similar bill in 2021, though for procedural reason on the bill not having enough readings.

In his ruling Friday, Wingate said HB 388 violated five different sections of the Kentucky Constitution, as the General Assembly only has legislative powers and is ""prohibited from interfering with the means by which the Governor carries out the law through executive branch contracts and cannot delegate the Governor’s expressly granted constitutional power to the Treasurer.""

The second bill struck down by Wingate is House Bill 248, which stipulated that Kentucky's attorney general is the only statewide constitutional officer allowed to expend taxpayer funds on litigation challenging the constitutionality of a bill.

The bill pushed by the Republican supermajority was a clear response to several lawsuits filed by Beshear in previous years to block GOP-led legislation from going into effect.

More:How Kentucky lawmakers are siphoning power from Gov. Any Beshear to GOP-held offices

Beshear vetoed HB 248 for being “a blatant attempt by the General Assembly to shield unconstitutional laws it passes from judicial review."" The governor filed the lawsuit challenging it and HB 388 shortly after the legislature overrode his vetoes.

Wingate's ruling to void the bill also said it violated five sections of the constitution, stating that while the General Assembly appropriates funding to the governor's office, it ""cannot use its appropriations power to obstruct the Kentucky Constitution"" and ""cannot insulate itself from judicial review through its appropriations power.""

Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, whose office argued in favor of the bills in the court, said in a statement he was ""disappointed"" by the rulings and will appeal them ""to ensure our elected representatives in the General Assembly have the ability to oversee the use of tax dollars.""

Beshear praised Wingate's ruling in a statement, saying it ""was necessary to protect our democracy in Kentucky.""

""The General Assembly had attempted to prevent other branches of government from stopping them when they took unconstitutional actions,"" Beshear said. ""This is a good ruling for anyone who supports our democracy, our constitution and our separation of powers.""

Spokespersons for GOP House Speaker David Osborne and Senate President Robert Stivers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

It's almost easier to say what didn't happen than what did.

Last year was no exception, as the greater Hillsdale area faced a county Republican Party in chaos, a library embroiled in controversy and a midterm election that heralded a sea change in Michigan.

Here's what we deemed the most impactful topics of 2022:

Hillsdale County GOP in chaos

It began when dozens of newly elected Hillsdale County GOP precinct delegates elected in the August primary were barred from entering the county ... and it never really ended after that.

The county party then split into two group: an ultraconservative faction (""America First"") and the newly elected moderates (Leininger faction). In late August, days before the state’s convention, Leininger’s faction convened its own meeting and elected a temporary executive committee to serve through the end of the year, ousting the “America First” faction, who dismissed the Leininger faction’s actions that day as unlawful.

The feud landed in court with Leininger’s faction filing for a preliminary injunction in October seeking a declaratory judgment, which a judge ultimately granted. However, the ""America First"" faction has vowed to carry on and not heed the ruling.

The year ended with more accusations of politically motivated attacks, with two Hillsdale County political activists arrested on criminal allegations of cyber-bullying. On Dec. 28, Michigan GOP Chairman Ron Weiser announced support for the Leininger faction — reversing his position from months earlier.

One thing's for sure: 2023 will see this in-fighting continue.

Jonesville police considers 48-hour shifts

The most read story on our website this year (over 50,000 pageviews) was about the Jonesville Police Department posting a job opening for two full-time police officers who would work 48-hour shifts with 96 hours off, similar to what fire departments and some emergency medical service agencies are doing across the country.

The city of Jonesville has one officer on per shift currently providing patrol coverage for just over 2,000 residents. The move was an effort to provide better work-life balance for officers while trying to provide continuous coverage to its community.

Officers would “live” at the department for their 48 hour shift and the posting touts a full kitchen, sleeping and showering quarters, cable television and internet are at the officers disposal. Despite the amenities, as of this writing, no one applied for the positions.

Tragic boating accident finally results in arrest

The community was heartbroken when an 11-year-old Indiana girl was struck and killed by a boat in July while on a trip at Camp Michindoh on East Bacon Road in Adams Township.

A lifeguard had 12 young children on a towable device behind a boat and that a spotter saw three fall from the device. When the boat was turned around to retrieve the three children, a fourth, who was not observed going into the water, was struck by the boat and succumbed to injuries.

In early October, authorities announced they had arrested and charged 25-year-old Matthew John Kovacic, of Hillsdale with one count of marine safety — negligent crippling or death

The rare crime falls under the natural resources and environmental protection Act 451 of 1994 and is punishable by up to two years in prison and/or a $2,000 fine.

Library sees resignations over LGBTQ materials

A series of Hillsdale Community librarian resignations rocked the community this summer after a controversial book ban proposal sparked controversy on both sides of an issue of whether LBGTQ books should be in the children’s section of the library.

The resignations followed a June library board meeting where Board Secretary Joshua Paladino authored and leaked an amendment to ban LGBTQ books from the children’s section amid others.

Paladino’s draft policy change was leaked on his social media and sent to friends of his by email asking for support at the meeting, which garnered a large audience from both those in favor of his proposal and those against it.

From teens and parents alleging the move would infringe on their First Amendment rights to board members wanting clearer rules on how materials are circulated, the issue was a lightning rod for months.

Michigan Midterm Elections

The morning after the November midterm election, Democratic Michiganders awoke to discover they'd kept the governorship, secretary of state and attorney general offices — in addition to passing all three statewide proposals and flipping the state House and Senate for the first time since the '80s.

Following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June, voters approved an amendment to enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution. Proposal 3 establishes a ""fundamental right to reproductive freedom"" which includes — but is not limited to — the right to seek abortion. It also protects a right to contraception and infertility care.

Michigan voters also adopted Proposal 2, a wide-ranging constitutional amendment to establish early voting, preempt efforts to enact more stringent voter ID rules and expand access to absentee voting.

Perhaps the most bipartisan support came for Proposal 1, a ballot proposal that modifies term limits for state legislators and requires them, the governor and others holding top elected offices in the state to disclose information about their finances that could reveal potential conflicts of interest.",Q4
https://www.ammoland.com/2022/10/financial-deplatforming-raises-its-head-again/,Financial Deplatforming Raises Its Head Again,"Opinion

USA -(AmmoLand.com)- Second Amendment supporters already see court rulings strike down laws that violate the Second Amendment across the country – it’s a good start. But they also swing good reasons to make addressing financial deplatforming a priority.

With JP Morgan Chase deciding to close Kanye West’s business accounts and Bank of America going after conservative social media commentator Catturd, the alarm is buzzing again – and Second Amendment supporters cannot afford to keep hitting the snooze button with regards to financial deplatforming.

The stakes aren’t just whether or not buying guns becomes a case of using cash. It also has the potential to cripple our ability to exercise the First Amendment to protect the Second Amendment. This is right out of a playbook long run by anti-Second Amendment extremists.

They tried and failed with McCain-Feingold, especially in the wake of Citizens United. They’ve been unable to pass other legislation that would expose donors. Letitia James and Andrew Cuomo’s jihad against the NRA ran into a First Amendment brick wall regarding their desire to dissolve the group.

However, the CEOs and top executives of big financial services corporations – be it banks, credit cards, or insurance companies – can act independently (or after prodding from anti-Second Amendment extremists in office), and there are not many Second Amendment supporters can do. Sure, some smaller banks might be safe havens for the short-to-medium term, but the only long-term security is the passage of strong legislation to address financial deplatforming in as many Second Amendment-friendly states as possible.

Think it won’t happen? There are two likely scenarios for a massive surge of financial deplatforming of the Second Amendment community – the first would be a SCOTUS ruling explicitly striking down bans on modern multi-purpose semi-automatic long guns. In that case, anti-Second Amendment extremists would likely push for corporate gun control due to a lack of other options.

The second scenario would be repeated school shootings like those in Uvalde or Sandy Hook. This time, we could see financial services companies cite “reputational risk,” with or without pressure from government officials (again, see Andrew Cuomo and Letitia James) or lawmakers.

The financial deplatforming can be halted firmly with strong legislation in the form of state-level versions of the Freedom Financing Act as a bare minimum. The fact of the matter is that Second Amendment supporters have to defeat the ability of banks to financially deplatform them in order to defeat anti-Second Amendment extremists via the ballot box at the federal, state, and local levels.

Smith plays “Whipped Peter,” a slave with a scarred back who escapes the swamps of Louisiana and eventually joins the Union Army to fight in the Civil War. The film is based on a true story and was inspired by a photograph of the scars that the real-life slave acquired after being brutally assaulted on a plantation. “Emancipation” will be released theatrically December 2 before streaming on Apple TV+ December 9.

Director Antoine Fuqua revealed that during the Louisiana-set shoot, Smith made a point of introducing himself to more than 300 extras on set, and even gave money to those playing corpses in the heat.

“He was kind to everyone on the set. Will would go around and hug and shake hands — we had 300-something extras and military, Marines. We had to stop Will from doing that because of COVID,” Fuqua told Vanity Fair. “He’s funny. He’s fun. We had certain extras that were the dead bodies in the graves, and he would go give them money for laying there in that heat over 100 degrees.”

Fuqua declined to comment on Will Smith’s incident at the Oscars, adding of filming, “I saw a different person than that one moment in time, and so my reaction was that particular moment is very foreign to me when it comes to Will Smith. I have nothing but amazing things to say about Will Smith, really genuinely. You can ask anybody that worked on the movie, they’ll tell you the same. Nicest person I’ve ever met in my life.”

The “Training Day” director noted that “as a filmmaker, I wasn’t out looking for a slave movie; I never saw ‘Emancipation’ as a slave movie.” Instead, the film is rooted in “sacred motivation” and the pursuit of freedom in both physical and spiritual senses.

“It was a story about triumph,” Fuqua said.

As for Smith’s performance, Fuqua added, “It’s really hard to release a character who’s been brutalized and called the N-word every day — constantly, every day — and still be the nicest person in the world.”

Smith admitted that it was a “grueling” process to embody the role of Pete.

“Not just for me, but for every single person working on the film,” Smith said. “We had therapists and spiritual teachers on set. We had a pastor. The daily reminder of the merciless treatment of a race of people was punishing to our spirits. And yet, I don’t think I would want to ‘shake off’Peter. The concept that Peter illuminated for me is that heaven and hell are states of consciousness. For me to have the opportunity to walk in Peter’s trial, and try to understand and dissect what is going on in the heart and mind of a man who has endured what he has endured — and survived — is a gift. It is a source of new inspiration and has helped me to cultivate a higher capacity for empathy.”

“Emancipation” marks Smith’s first onscreen performance since the infamous Oscars slap where the Best Actor winner attacked presenter Chris Rock. While Smith is banned from attending the Academy Awards for 10 years, critics have already speculated that “Emancipation” could be an awards season player.

The corps commanders at their monthly conference at the General Headquarters — the first after the change of command last month, according to ISPR, “resol­ved to fight against terrorists without any distinction and eliminate this menace as per the aspirations of the people of Pakistan”.

The two-day conference, which began on Tuesday, was chaired by Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir.

The media statement indicated that the focus of the discussion remained largely on the resurgence of terrorism in the country, even though the commanders also undertook a “review of professional and organisational matters of the Army”.

The surge in terrorism incidents in Khyber-Pakh­tun­khwa and Balochistan provinces and more importantly the botched suicide bombing attempt in Islamabad in which a policeman lost his life last Friday underscore the growing problem of militant violence, which has further complicated the challenges of political instability and economic meltdown.

In the past few months, over a hundred attacks have been claimed by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), whose leadership has been operating from Afghanis­­tan. These attacks have mostly targeted the law enforcement agencies.

While the most significant threat is coming from TTP, at the same time insurgents in Balochistan have also stepped up their attacks. They have, moreover, formed a nexus with TTP, making the problem even more complex.

This nexus is being seen as one of the reasons why TTP has been able to stage so many attacks in Balochistan.

Amid indicators that the terrorist threat may increase next year, analysts have been criticising the military for not coming up with a comprehensive strategy to counter it.

The brief ISPR statement did not specifically mention if some new kinetic operation had been okayed, but its tone and almost single focus on the terrorism threat put across the message that counter-terrorism would be the new leadership’s top priority.

Gen Munir had soon after taking over the command visited the western border and had reiterated the pledge to end the menace of terrorism at all costs, while emphasising that no one will be allowed to spoil the hard earned peace.

The new army chief’s messaging has been less through words and more through optics. His resolve to fight back the terrorists was clear from a recent picture of sombre, but firm-looking Gen Munir carrying the coffin of Capt Fahd Khan along with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza. Capt Fahd was martyred over the weekend in an IED blast in Kahan, Balochistan.

The reference to “review of professional and organisational matters” suggested that the top brass could have considered restructuring and redeployments especially in midst of reports that certain austerity measures were being planned.

Besides, there were some crucial issues about which the statement was completely silent.

The corps commanders conference happened in the backdrop of intensifying economic crisis, but there was no mention of the economic security that remained a major concern during Gen Munir’s predecessor’s tenure.

As the Army says it has decided to remain out of governance and political matters, it is plausible that the generals did not discuss economy in deference of that policy decision. Interestingly, the conference happened as rumours about a meeting for discussing the possibility of installation of a technocrats’ government for fixing the economy made rounds.

Similarly, there was nothing on the review of external and regional security in the media statement especially relating to India and Afghanistan.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/11/21/lgbtq-violence-hate-crimes/10749639002/,Colorado Springs shooting joins growing list of LGBTQ hate crimes in America,"A violent attack at Club Q, an LGBTQ+ nightclub in Colorado Springs, occurred in the early hours of Sunday morning when a gunman opened fire, shooting 22 and killing five.

The attack joins a long list of violent assaults on the LGBTQ+ community, particularly at bars and nightclubs.

Nearly 1 in 5 hate crimes is motivated by anti-LGBTQ+ bias.

Shortly after midnight Saturday, a gunman entered Club Q, an LGBTQ+ nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and opened fire, shooting 22 people and leaving at least five dead. The shooter has been identified by police as Anderson Lee Aldrich, 22, who was arrested shortly after they arrived.

Though a motive has not been officially declared by authorities, Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers told NBC's TODAY that, ""it has all the trappings of a hate crime."" The attack coincided with ""Trans Day of Remembrance"", an annual day for remembering lives lost to anti-trans violence. Two of the five victims killed at Club Q were trans.

As the community turns to mourning and stories emerge of the club patrons who charged the gunman in hopes of stopping further bloodshed, the event evokes countless past targeted attacks on the LGBTQ+ community.

The Human Rights Campaign, the country's largest LGBTQ+ civil rights organization reports that nearly 1 out of every 5 hate crimes is now motivated by an anti-LGBTQ+ bias. Here is a brief look at the history of violence against folks in the community over the years.

Pulse nightclub shooting

In June 2016, a gunman entered Pulse nightclub in Orlando – a venue known to serve the LGBTQ+ community – and unleashed an attack that killed 49 people, making it the second-most deadly mass shooting in American history.

The shooting, which took place during Pride Month, remains a potent symbol of the threat to life faced by many members of the LGBTQ+ community as the fight for acceptance and equality continues.

UpStairs Lounge fire

In June 1973 an arsonist attacked the UpStairs Lounge, a popular LGBTQ establishment in the French Quarter of New Orleans. A total of 32 people were killed, and at least 15 were injured.

Though no arrest was every made in the incident and no official motive determined, it was assumed by many to be a targeted attack, and as much of LGBTQ+ nightlife was underground at that time, it also prompted a crackdown on nearby bars.

Harvey Milk assassination

On Nov. 27, 1978, Harvey Milk, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and a prominent gay figure at the time, was assassinated by political opponent Dan White. White also shot and killed San Francisco Mayor George Moscone.

Milk was one of the first openly gay elected officials in the United States and became an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ+ liberation. His killing and the subsequent sentencing of seven years, eight months, doled out to White perpetuated the hate and prejudice against the community.

'West Street Massacre'

That was The New York City News headline in late November 1980 announcing an attack in Greenwich Village less than 10 days prior.

Just before 11 p.m. on Nov. 19, 1980, Ronald K. Crumpley, a former transit police officer, began an armed rampage in the New York City neighborhood, gunning down two outside a deli before opening fire on a crowd gathered in front of Sneakers, a gay bar.

The attack, which Crumpley admitted was a targeted assault on the gay community, ultimately left two dead and injured six more.

Otherside Lounge bombing

In February 1997, the Otherside Lounge, an LGBTQ+ bar in Atlanta, was bombed in a terrorist attacked that injured patrons and eventually put the venue out of business.

The bombing was later attributed to Eric Robert Rudolph, who carried out two other attacks that year and in 2005 was sentenced to life in prison.

Mathew Shepard murder

In early October 1998, Mathew Shepard, a gay teen in Laramie, Wyoming, was brutally attacked and tied to a fence. Found hours after the attack, Shepard died just day later from injuries he had sustained.

Shepard was a student at the University of Wyoming. He met attackers Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney at a gay bar. They later drew him to a nearby parking lot where they robbed and beat him before bringing him to a remote location, inflicting further injuries and leaving him to weather freezing temperatures.

The story gained national attention, sparking outrage and eventually leading to the passage of the Mathew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act more than 10 years later.

Shepard's attackers were ultimately spared the death penalty in part due to testimony from his parents. “I would like nothing better than to see you die, Mr. McKinney,"" Shepard's father said. However, this is the time to begin the healing process. To show mercy to someone who refused to show any mercy.”

Backstreet Cafe shooting

In September 2000, a man opened fire at the Backstreet Cafe, a gay bar in Roanoke, Virginia. The attack killed one and injured six others.

Assailant Ronald Gay had gone to another bar and asked where the nearest gay bar was, police later said. Witnesses reported he made clear he wanted to attack the bar on the basis of its patrons' sexuality.

Attack on Cece McDonald

In June 2011, Cece Mcdonald, a young Black trans woman, was violently attacked by a group of white people in Minneapolis who shouted racist and transphobic slurs at her. In response, McDonald used a pair of scissors she had with her to stab and kill one of the men in the group.

She later pleaded self-defense but was sentenced to over three years in prison for second-degree manslaughter, to be served in a men's prison. Since her release, McDonald has become an activist focused on LGBTQ+ liberation and the dismantling of the so-called prison industrial complex.

Violence against trans & gender non-conforming community continues

The Human Rights Campaign reports they have officially recorded at least 300 violent deaths of transgender and gender non-conforming people since they began tracking numbers in 2013– 32 of which occurred in 2022 alone.

The victims of this violence, HRC reports, are overwhelmingly Black, under the age of 35 and killed by a firearm. In 2021, 57 trans and gender non-conforming people were violently killed, making it the deadliest year on record.",Q4
https://www.pressherald.com/2022/10/30/facing-housing-shortage-bowdoinham-brainstorms-development-ideas/,"Facing housing shortage, Bowdoinham brainstorms development ideas","Bowdoinham is looking for ways to combat a housing crisis that is driving away young professionals, young families and senior citizens.

At an Oct. 26 meeting, the Bowdoinham Community Development Initiative orchestrated a sit-down with affordable housing developer John Egan of the Genesis Fund, housing planner Michael Martone, the Bowdoinham Comprehensive Planning Board and community members to discuss the town’s housing needs and find ways to encourage development.

As a senior struggling to take care of her four-bedroom farmhouse, Peggy Christian said she wants to downsize to a two-bedroom home, but there is “nothing for sale.” Christian said her current home is “too much to take care of,” but she doesn’t want to leave Bowdoinham.

Housing Authority member Tom Cary attributes the lack of housing to out-of-staters who once rented in Maine during the summer months and have now snatched up “a great deal of properties.”

In 2020, Maine gained 15,473 people from domestic migration, according to a previous article in the Portland Press Herald.

Assistant Broker Cara Taggersell said when she moved to Bowdoinham seven years ago, she and her partner fixed up an old farmhouse, which she said is an attractive option for young couples. However, since the pandemic, even fixer-uppers are scarce.

According to realtor.com, housing availability in Bowdoinham is significantly lower compared to neighboring towns. In Bowdoinham, there are six houses listed, including two that have yet to be built. Brunswick has 62 available listings, Topsham has 16 and Richmond has 15.

The listings in Bowdoinham range from $125,000-$650,000, none of which are designed to accommodate a solo owner.

Resident Pam Buffington noted the lack of one-bedroom apartments available for young singles, which she said could possibly discourage new teachers from working in their school district. She said building co-housing units with shared resources could be a solution, and she believes it would fit the well-established community culture of “supporting one another.”

Piggybacking off of Buffington, resident David Asmussen proposed “incentivizing density downtown” to draw a younger population and new businesses.

Overall, locals said they wanted more duplexes, housing for farm workers on-site at the farms, housing near the highway, affordable senior housing, cluster housing, more commercial spaces downtown, co-housing units, cul-de-sac developments, dividing large plots of land into smaller ones and revamped septic rules.

Bowdoinham Director of Planning and Development Jennifer Curtis acknowledged, “Anything you have described could happen.” However, Curtis said when the town does develop its comprehensive housing plan, it will have to factor in the required setbacks for new septic systems to wetlands.

Discussions on ways to implement the new ideas will take place after the holidays.",Q4

HAMPTON, Va. — It takes a big effort to help others in the community, and that's what Shant'a Miller White has made her mission over the past 10 years.

A mother of three in Hampton, she said she'll never forget the day in 2012 her 11-year-old daughter was attacked on the school bus by a 14-year-old bully.

Instead of holding onto the anger, White decided there was something more she could do. She founded the nonprofit organization Parents Against Bullying Virginia to empower and educate families and communities.

Through workshops, mentoring sessions, school visits and other events, White and her team of volunteers are committed to spreading awareness of and putting an end to bullying.

""Back in 2012, we really didn't have a whole lot of people talking about bullying and resources in that nature, so I started having resource events and pulling events for resources for people, just to let people know it's okay to speak out,"" White said.

13News Now wanted to shine a light on White's organization and her efforts throughout the Hampton Roads community. With the help of our parent company, TEGNA, we gave White $6,500 to help give her organization a little boost.

""It's been so hard. People see what you're doing and think it's easy, but they don't know the back stories of trying to make it happen,"" said White. ""Thank you, thank you TEGNA Foundation. Thank you so much.""

White says she struggled during the pandemic to keep her organization going strong.

She said because she relies on public gatherings and events to get volunteers in and to promote donations, she had to work extra hard to keep her organization and her message against bullying afloat.

It's a small gesture for a big effort to help others in Hampton Roads.

""You're going to see exactly what we're going to do this,"" said White. ""We're going to cover even more land, more children, more hearts and we're going to keep encouraging those stars. We want everyone to know they're a star, successful and smart, terrific and talented, and refuse to be bullied and put down.""",Q4
https://www.dawn.com/news/1728875/g7-tells-taliban-to-urgently-reverse-ban-on-women-aid-workers,G7 tells Taliban to ‘urgently reverse’ ban on women aid workers,"G7 foreign ministers on Thursday called on the Taliban to “urgently reverse” a ban on women working in Afghanistan’s aid sector.

The ban is the latest blow against women’s rights in Afghanistan since the Taliban reclaimed power last year.

The Taliban also barred women from attending universities earlier this month, prompting global outrage and protests in some Afghan cities.

The G7 ministers along with those of Australia, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, and the Netherlands said in a joint statement they were “gravely concerned that the Taliban’s reckless and dangerous order… puts at risk millions of Afghans who depend on humanitarian assistance for their survival”.

“We call on the Taliban to urgently reverse this decision,” they said in the statement issued by Britain’s foreign ministry.

It comes after six aid bodies suspended operations in Afghanistan in response to the ban.

They included Christian Aid, ActionAid, Save the Children, the Norwegian Refugee Council, and CARE.

The International Rescue Committee, which provides emergency response in health, education, and other areas and employs 3,000 women across Afghanistan, also said it was suspending services.

“Women are absolutely central to humanitarian and basic needs operations. Unless they participate in aid delivery in Afghanistan, NGOs will be unable to reach the country’s most vulnerable people to provide food, medicine, winterisation, and other materials and services they need to live,” the G7 statement said.

“The Taliban continue to demonstrate their contempt for the rights, freedoms, and welfare of the Afghan people, particularly women and girls,” it added.

Christian Aid has warned that millions of people in Afghanistan are on the “verge of starvation”.

“Reports that families are so desperate they have been forced to sell their children to buy food are utterly heartbreaking,” said Christian Aid’s head of global programmes Ray Hasan.

A ban on women aid workers would “only curtail our ability to help the growing number of people in need”, he added.

The Taliban’s ban has come at a time when millions across the country are dependent on humanitarian aid provided by international donors through a vast network of NGOs.

Afghanistan’s economic crisis has only worsened since the Taliban seized power in August last year, which led to Washington freezing billions of dollars of its assets and foreign donors cutting aid.

After the minister of higher education banned women from universities, charging that they too were not properly dressed, protests were forcefully dispersed by the authorities.

Since returning to power in August last year, the Taliban had already barred teenage girls from secondary school.

Women have also been pushed out of many government jobs, prevented from travelling without a male relative, and ordered to cover up outside of the home, ideally with a burqa.

https://www.thepinknews.com/2022/12/07/steven-lorenzo-death-sentence-florida-gay-murders/,Steven Lorenzo: Alleged murderer asks for death sentence,"Steven Lorenzo is one of two men accused of murdering Jason Galehouse and Michael Wachholtz in December 2003, and until now had pleaded not guilty, reports the Tampa Bay Times.

The other man is Scott Schweickert who, eventually in 2016, agreed to plead guilty to his role in the deaths – getting a life sentence but avoiding the death penalty for testifying against Lorenzo in prosecutors’ efforts to convict him.

He went on to confess that Galehouse and Wachholtz were taken to Lorenzo’s home in Seminole Heights, Tampa, where they were drugged, sexually tortured and then killed.

Both men were imprisoned – Lorenzo in 2005 for 200 years – on charges related to using the drug GHB to facilitate sexual assaults against a number of men, including both of the deceased.

However, Lorenzo was only charged with murder after Schweickert’s 2016 guilty plea.

He had pleaded not guilty until last week when he wrote a 16-page court paper saying he wanted to plead guilty, be sentenced to death and waive his right to an appeal. This was then reiterated in court on Friday (2 December).

The Tampa Bay Times reported the only explanation from Lorenzo, who has been representing himself in court, was his apparent pessimism about his chances of success in a trial.

Florida man says sentence ‘doesn’t bother him’

Hillsborough Circuit judge Christopher Sabella asked if Lorenzo understood his decision: ”life or execution at the hands of Department of Corrections”.

Lorenzo said either one “doesn’t bother him” because he’s already effectively serving a life sentence and he doesn’t mind death due to his age (63).

However, judge Sabella also explained Lorenzo could not just be sentenced to death but there was instead a legal process that had to be followed.

A new hearing was set for Tuesday (6 December).

A friend of Galehouse, Tyler Butler, and Tampa Pride president Carrie West, both told the Tampa Bay Times they were sceptical of Lorenzo’s intentions.

Butler questions “why all of a sudden now”, given it had been 19 years.

West thought “there’s a surprise happening”.

“I would think right now that there’s going to be another great big hiccup Tuesday”.

Elsewhere in the United States, the New York Police Department is investigating the deaths of two men who died shortly after nights out at gay bars this year – both also having thousands of dollars stolen.

A number of other men came forward to The New York Times about being drugged at gay bars and similarly being robbed.

It was highlighted how date rape drugs – including GHB, which Lorenzo was convicted of using – do not remain in the body system very long and are not included in most drug and toxicology tests.",Q4
https://original.antiwar.com/william_astore/2022/12/08/beware-of-long-wars/,Beware of Long Wars,"Reprinted from Bracing Views with the author’s permission.

Reports that Ukraine is launching modified drones to strike airbases deep in Russia highlight the unpredictability and escalatory nature of wars. Ukraine is no longer content at defending itself against Russian aggression; Russia itself must be made a target, which will likely provoke harsher Russian counterattacks. Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress continues to authorize billions in military aid to Ukraine, which is pitched as defending democracy and freedom.

War is many things but it is rarely democratic. Indeed, as James Madison warned, war is inherently anti-democratic. It strengthens authoritarian forces and contributes to abuses of power and corruption. As the Russia-Ukraine War goes on, with no clear resolution in sight, Ukraine suffers more even as the chances of escalation rise.

What’s needed now is resolute diplomacy – a committed effort to end the war by all parties involved, obviously Russia and Ukraine but also the US and NATO. The longer this disastrous war lasts, the more unpredictable it will become, the more atrocious it will prove, and the more likely ordinary Ukrainians and Russians will suffer and die, whether at various battlefronts or on the homefront.

Negotiation is not weakness nor is it appeasement. Negotiation is sensible, rational, and life-affirming. But there’s little reason for Ukraine to negotiate when it’s enjoying a blank check of support from the US and NATO.

Meanwhile, as Ukraine continues striking deep into Russia, one wonders to what extent the US military and intelligence agencies are involved. Did the US provide technology? Targeting information? Intelligence? Or is Ukraine doing this entirely on its own, a scenario that is less than comforting?

I sure hope the US and Russia are talking. In the confusion and chaos of war, how is Russia to know for sure that an attack on one of their strategic air bases is coming from Ukraine and not from NATO territory? Even if it’s clearly coming from Ukraine, if these attacks are enabled or approved by the US/NATO, will the Russians see them as an act of war? Will they respond militarily, creating even more escalatory pressure?

Bizarrely, Ukraine’s defensive war against Russia has been sold as America’s “good” war, a chance to weaken Russia and Putin in the cause of defending Ukrainian “democracy.” But as Ukraine’s tactics turn more offensive, and as the Ukrainian government likely becomes more authoritarian due to the pressures of war, how wise is it for the United States to continue to send massive amounts of military aid there while discouraging diplomacy?

Policies that end in prolonging the Russia-Ukraine War in the name of teaching Putin a lesson and eroding his power may teach us all a lesson in how war is not just antidemocratic War runs to extremes, and only fools believe they can control it in a way that is conducive to liberty and freedom and justice.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/10/22/bakhmut-russia-ukraine-wagner-war/,"In bloody battle for Bakhmut, Russian mercenaries eye a symbolic prize","BAKHMUT, Ukraine — The crash and roar of artillery rarely stops in this eastern Ukrainian city. In the cold and broken houses, residents huddle by candlelight and pray that they have safety in numbers. On the battlefield, soldiers on both sides are dying in droves. While Ukrainian advances have redrawn the battlefield map elsewhere, the front line in Bakhmut, in the Donetsk region some 10 miles from the border of Luhansk, has barely moved in four months of heavy fighting.

Of all the battles in the east, President Volodymyr Zelensky said last week, the “most difficult” is here. Yet in this fight for control of a shattered city, military experts say the ambitions of a Russian oligarch, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner mercenary group, may have eclipsed all strategic logic.

After a disorderly Russian retreat from nearby Izyum, the battle for Bakhmut is no longer part of any coordinated military operation. Instead, Prigozhin is pouring waves of mercenaries from Wagner into battle, appearing to see political advantage in capturing Bakhmut as a military trophy while President Vladimir Putin’s regular forces are on the back foot elsewhere.

Outgunned and outnumbered, exhausted Ukrainian troops are relying on nimbler tactics to withstand the brutal battle, monitoring enemy lines with civilian drones as newly recruited engineers experiment with customized weapons from pop-up laboratories in abandoned buildings nearby.

“To be honest, we have to,” said Vlad, who is overseeing the 93rd Brigade’s effort to refit drones, antitank mines and other weapons so that they are more effective. “The Russians have the soldiers, the guns, everything. We need to be smart,” he said.

The salt-mining city of Bakhmut had a population of 70,000 before Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Perhaps 15,000 remain, but the streets were almost empty as fighting raged there this week. Weeds smothered the wheat fields. Military vehicles sped down roads gouged by rockets, kicking up clouds of dust as they went.

At the 93rd Brigade’s command post, a drone operator peered at the live feed of Russian positions that it was sending back to him. The soldiers worked fast, slipping mortar rounds down the barrel and loosing them up through the sky. Someone had scrawled “director” on the drone operator’s chair. Squinting down at the screen of his tablet, he waited a second, then he nodded, and a ripple of delight coursed through the men.

They had hit the target.

But these still felt like some of the unit’s worst days, said Dima, their 25-year-old commander. When darkness enveloped their dugout a night earlier, Russian forces fired on them with mortars and cluster munitions. “It’s not the first time we’ve been under fire, but this is different now,” Dima said.

After four years in the Ukrainian army, Dima said the battle for Bakhmut was among the “most dangerous” he had witnessed.

The fighting and its echoes hung heavy through the city on Wednesday. The air throbbed with the sound of shelling. When that fell quiet, clanking metal in the wind was the only sound left.

A 51-year-old entrepreneur, Oleksander, had dried blood on his face from a rocket strike that smashed his home the night before. He did not have clean water to wash up. He said he had invited his neighbors, a young couple and their daughter, to stay with him in the apartment, thinking that they would be safer if they stuck together.

The parents were now in intensive care, he said, and their 9-year-old child, Liza, had been evacuated, alone, to another city.

“I thought our place was safer,” he said blankly. “We were just sitting there. We were drinking tea.”

In a recent analysis, the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, described Prigozhin’s Bakhmut effort as “irrelevant operationally” after Russia’s loss of Izyum, 60 miles north.

“The Russian seizure of Bakhmut, which is unlikely to occur considering Russian forces have impaled themselves on tiny surrounding settlements for weeks, would no longer support any larger effort to accomplish the original objectives of this phase of the campaign,” the report concluded, “since it would not be supported by an advance from Izyum in the north.”

Prigozhin, who is nicknamed Putin’s chef because he grew fabulously wealthy off of government catering contracts, has been a loud critic of the regular Russian military’s performance in Ukraine. His involvement in the Ukraine war is seen by analysts as part of his effort to curry favor and potentially additional state contracts. There is also speculation among the Russian elite that he is angling for a government post.

Wagner played a key role in the capture of Popasna in May but reportedly took heavy losses. According to pro-Kremlin military bloggers, Prigozhin was awarded the nation’s highest honor, a Hero of Russia medal, the following month.

After long denying any link to Wagner, which has sent soldiers-for-hire to Syria, Libya, Mali, Mozambique and the Central African Republic, Prigozhin acknowledged last month that he created the group. In a recent self-published interview he claimed that Wagner was carrying out the assault on Bakhmut alone, and called the situation “difficult.”

For the Ukrainians, surrendering Bakhmut would give the Russians a hugely symbolic victory, and undermine the prevailing narrative that Moscow’s forces are steadily losing ground and Putin’s war is failing. In theory, capturing Bakhmut would put the Russians one step closer to bigger urban centers of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, but there is little evidence that the Russians could make a push for them now.

Across four locations in the Bakhmut area, Ukrainian soldiers described how Wagner troops at times appear to have been used almost as cannon fodder. “They’re treating them like single-use soldiers,” said Volodymyr, 24, the commander of a self-propelled artillery unit, as he waited on spotters to call in a new target. Usually it was infantry, he said.

Another soldier nodded.

“If we are shelling those positions, they keep pushing the men forward again and again,” the second soldier said. “They want to smoke us out, then fire artillery on us.”

From the 93rd Brigade’s position, drone operators have seen the mercenaries stumble over the bodies of fallen comrades as they advance.

A Russian reporter who filmed Wagner’s front-line positions near Bakhmut late last month reported that Prigozhin’s son was fighting there, and interviewed him, without identifying him by name.

“Bakhmut is a road to many directions. It’s a very important point strategically for the Ukrainian forces and for us,” another fighter said in the video. “Their team is ready to fight until the end, no matter what the losses are.”

The scale of the Russian losses are not known, but Ukrainian soldiers interviewed said they estimated them to be significant. “The number is big on their side because they’re not treating them like people,” said Misha, a 25-year-old soldier from the 93rd Brigade.

Ukraine’s casualties are also heavy. Ambulances shuttled back and forth between the Ukrainian firing positions last week, apparently carrying wounded men from the front line.

At a nearby hospital, two soldiers said they had brought four members of their unit to the emergency room after a Russian rocket attack in Bakhmut, and that three were in a critical condition. Their bloodstained jackets were still in the car. In a video taken shortly after the incident, the fourth man was seen howling in pain with his femur snapped at a sickening angle.

The day before, they said, another company had been surrounded by Russian forces, and fired upon. “There weren’t even pieces of them left,” said one of the soldiers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of describing Ukrainian casualties.

For Bakhmut’s residents, there is also little left. Rockets pound the city every day. A civilian doctor tries to patch up the injuries, but the walking wounded often just pull the shrapnel from their bodies on their own.

Standing on the Bakhmutka River’s eastern bank this week, Vitalii Kuzmienko, 52, stared up at a damaged bridge, its deck blown away, leaving a huge gap at mid-span. To stop Russian forces from advancing, the Ukrainians had laid antitank mines on one side, but those mines never detonated.

Kuzmienko said his house had been destroyed in the fighting, and so he was living in the wreckage of an outdoor market. His relatives were buried in Bakhmut, he said, and he didn’t want to leave them.

Local authorities noted in an Aljazeera News report that the people killed in the incident included six women. It was also determined as the second mass shooting in the Mexican state in less than a month.

The city government said in a statement that security officials were trying to track down the assailants, with three people injured in the attack on Saturday.

The search for the attackers is supported by Guanajuato's Secretary for Public Safety, the state prosecutor general's office, the Secretary of National Defense, and the National Guard.

It is still unclear who the victims are and how many gunmen were involved in the shooting, CNN reported.

The state of Guanajuato has been plagued by brutal turf wars between rival Mexican drug cartels, prompting a rise in violent attacks in the area.

On September 21, gunmen shot dead 10 people in an attack at a bar in Guanajuato in the town of Tarimoro.

Guanajuato Violence

In August, hundreds of Mexican troops were deployed to the northern border city of Ciudad Juarez to improve security after a series of random gang attacks across the town, leaving at least 11 dead.

Los Angeles Times reported that the dead included a popular radio personality and three of his co-workers. In a separate incident, two inmates were shot in a prison riot.

Officials noted that the bloody prison riot in Juarez sparked the rampage in acts of retaliation, while authorities pinned the blame in Jalisco and Guanajuato on cartel leaders on plans to arrest them.

Insecurity in Guanajuato state has intensified, with one resident running a fruit and vegetable stand saying that ""there's no government here,"" adding that the narcos are the government.

Rogelio Cornejo Diaz said the president should come to the state with his wife and children if he thinks all is fine and tranquil.

Mexico's homicide rate has dipped only slightly since Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office in December 2018.

Lopez Obrador has promised to take a more holistic approach to fight crime while vowing to reject the militarized strategy of his predecessors and boost social programs for those vulnerable to joining gangs.

Mexican Drug Cartels

Mexican drug cartels dominate the import and distribution of cocaine, fentanyl, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine in the United States.

The largest Mexican drug cartels include Sinaloa Cartel, formerly led by El Chapo. It is considered to be one of Mexico's oldest and most influential drug trafficking groups, according to a Council on Foreign Relations report.

Jalisco Cartel is also considered Mexico's fastest-growing cartel, with operations in more than two-thirds of the country.

U.S. officials estimated that Jalisco Cartel supplies more than one-third of the U.S. drug market.

Meanwhile, the Beltran-Leyva Organization was formed when the Beltran-Leyva brothers split from Sinaloa in 2008.

All four brothers have been arrested or killed, but supporters and loyalists continue to operate throughout Mexico.

These electric voting systems have gotten mixed reactions from US citizens, some think they are reliable and are grateful for them because they make the lives of the disabled a lot easier. On the other hand, some want to boycott them because they can be hacked.

How the Voting System Works

The voting machine that Gilbert designed has been in the works for almost 20 years. It consists of a transparent box, which also serves as a touchscreen interface.

Inside the transparent box is where the printer is located, which is connected to the device's software Prime III. Then, it points the voter's selection on a paper that is fed into a scanner to be tallied. The transparent case ensures that if a USB device is connected to a hack, the system will be detected by voters right away.

To ensure that the software is not corrupted, it is stored on a Blu-Ray disc in a read-only format. As an extra layer of protection, the voting machine will reboot every single time a vote is cast.

The transparent touchscreen guarantees that voters are staring right at the printer immediately once they cast their vote.

Earlier this year, Gilbert requested to have several experts give them access to his machine to be tested by the best minds. Prime III uses open-source software, which would make it easier to hack into. However, Gilbert has already bared it all when it comes to the code.

Unfortunately, not one expert tested the system this year. Then, there is also a matter of the system that should be certified which will require him to spend a lot of money.

Will It Ever See Election Day?

The main problem is that it will be a lot of hard work and money to convince the government to use the system because they are very particular about the way things are done. Gilbert also believes that if he builds the prototype, people will rush to get the invention, but it will still be a business for him.

In the coming years, as technology keeps advancing, we may need to reform our current voting system since it can be easily hacked. With people developing such a machine, it might speed up the creation of more trustworthy voting machines. The United States should seriously consider Gilbert's voting system.

Gilbert's voting system is designed to make voting a more effective and reliable process. The transparent screen is a great tool because voters can check to see if their votes are being recorded as they cast their ballot. It looks like the ""hacking"" problem is finally being addressed.

PHOENIX (AP) — Abortion is the top issue in the Arizona attorney general election that pits Republican Abraham Hamadeh against Democrat Kris Mayes.

Hamadeh, a former Maricopa County prosecutor and intelligence officer in the U.S. Army Reserve, promises to uphold Arizona’s longstanding ban on abortion if elected in November. He is endorsed by former President Donald Trump for the Nov. 8 contest.

Mayes, an attorney and university professor who served for seven years on the Arizona Corporation Commission, says she supports abortion rights and doesn’t consider either the older ban or a more recent law to be constitutional.

RELATED: Arizona clinic has workaround for abortion pill ban

""My opponent apparently is OK with forcing the victims of rape and incest to carry to term,"" Mayes said last week during the only televised debate the pair will have during their contest.

Hamadeh said the attorney general can’t unilaterally decide which laws to uphold.

The near-total abortion ban that passed when Arizona was still a territory currently remains in effect after the Pima County Superior Court’s denial last week of a stay requested by Planned Parenthood.

A new law enacted this year prohibits abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy and is less stringent than the original ban.

Term limits prevent Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, now finishing his second four-year term, from running again. He is seeking the Republican nomination for Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly’s seat.

MORE: Arizona abortion rights backers sue to overturn old ban

Brnovich has been mired in the debate over reproductive rights in Arizona since the U.S. Supreme Court this year overturned the Roe v. Wade decision that called abortion a constitutional right.

The candidates vying for his seat also exchanged heated arguments over their job experience during last week’s debate, which was sponsored by the Arizona Clean Elections Commission.

Both candidates said the other lacked the proper experience for the job.

The attorney general is Arizona’s top prosecutor and represents state agencies on legal matters. They can investigate voter fraud and approve the wording of ballot propositions.

Mayes said she would fight for voting rights as Arizona’s attorney general. Hamadeh has said the 2020 presidential vote was rigged against Trump.",Q4

LAST Sunday, thousands of local residents in Wana — the headquarters of South Waziristan tribal district – took to the streets against the recent wave of terrorism in the region, demanding civil administration fulfil its responsibilities to restore peace in the area.

The key demands of protestors included a ban on armed groups in the district, tackling the rise of terrorism, getting rid of kidnappings for ransom and emphatic security for the general public and business community.

The huge gathering titled “peace march” was organised by Wana Siyasi Ittihad (WSI}, and very interestingly, the demonstration was also attended by members of the PTI, Jamaat-e-Islami, PML-N and other political parties.

This is not the first time that people from all walks of life, regardless of their political belongings, have been the part of such demonstrations against religious extremism.

Ever since the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other extremist groups, after the fall of Kabul in August last year, have started penetrating this part of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, there has been a simmering uprising against these extremist elements in the region.

This is a totally new phenomenon in the region that has seriously surprised the TTP leadership as well as other religio-political leaders.

This region, for various reasons including the poor literacy rate, widespread network of religious Madaris and deep sectarian divide, was always considered to be the fertile ground for extremism.

That’s why the TTP and its allies always try to make it the base-camp of their operations in Pakistan.

But things seem to be quite different for them, as evident by the new wave of massive joint protests and demonstrations by the local residents in the last few months.

Such a reaction from the locals, who are generously considered to be staunch pro-religious in their approach, is certainly the most positive development for a country that has been experiencing the gradual rise of religious extremism for the last four decades.

The most encouraging part of these demonstrations is the participation of a Jamaat-e-Islami and some other religious parties.

The participation of the religious political parties, having the similar sectarian identity as the TTP, is certainly an indicator of the fact that religious extremism is now entering into a declining phase in Pakistan – may be the beginning of the end, to be more optimistic.

The reaction of the general public including businessmen, teachers, laborers, fruit-sellers, lawyers, shopkeepers and even imams of local mosques is heralding the emergence of anti-extremism mindset in the country.

Religious extremism has both forms – benign and violent. However, the current form of violent religious extremism in Pakistan is solely linked to the Afghan war and its remnants in the form of a huge network of extremist organizations taking shelter in selected Madaris as their base camps.

Although most of the Madaris in Pakistan have direct connections with religious political parties, reports and surveys conducted by local and international media suggest that only 10-15 per cent of Madaris are found to have any direct or indirect links with the religious extremists groups.

Over the last four decades, however, some Madaris have increasingly played a role contrary to their original intent.

Founded as centres of learning for the next generation of Islamic scholars and clerics, some of these schools have built extremely close ties with radical militant groups and play a critical role in sustaining the terrorist networks – particularly during the Afghan war, the Americans blatantly funded these Madaris to work as the nurseries of mercenaries to support the Afghan Mujahideen.

The Americans very tactfully changed the purpose of these religious institutions to prepare the new lots of Islamic fighters to resist Russian influence by waging a jihad against the foreign occupation forces.

Since then, despite all sincere efforts by the successive governments in Pakistan to “disinfect’” and “cleanse” these Madaris and revert them back to the original role of imparting religious teaching only, the violent religious extremism is continuously on rise in Pakistan.

Dozens of studies and transformational plans, with financial support from international community, have been launched to transform the madrassa school system and entice them to assimilate with mainstream education system.

Some of these plans, on paper, appeared to be very effective to achieve this objective, but all such efforts have so far been unable to deliver anything tangible.

Yes, there has been reasonable success in collecting data about all religious Madaris and their geo-tagging.

The fact is that the religio-political leadership, which is the main beneficiary of this madrassa system, is not ready to allow any madrassa reforms that entails the government intervention to transform these Madaris at all.

This is perhaps the major stumbling block in the way of any madrassa reforms. The second National Internal Security Policy document (NISP 2018-2023) is perhaps a comprehensive document, if implemented in letter and spirit, has all the potential to bring about major changes in the outlook of these Madaris and muffle the prospects of religious violent extremism in this country.

A new national narrative is part of this document that advocates “a tolerant, inclusive and democratic society” thriving on cultural and religious diversity.

As per the NISP document, plurality, diversity and tolerant teachings of Islam will be prepared and disseminated through curricula of schools and Madaris.

There is no doubt that radicalization and militancy is not just limited to Madaris or its students, and people from affluent backgrounds, with modern educational qualifications, are also vulnerable targets of the radical narratives and notions.

The NISP document is a very comprehensive action plan that covers all aspects of this major transformation of the centuries old madrassa system into the mainstream education system without compromising its original intent.

But the leadership of Madaris and some religio-political parties, because of their ‘corporate’ motives, are not ready to support the NISP action plan.

However, the demonstrations and protests in South Waziristan and Swat valley are reflective of the new thinking against religious extremism and radicalism – a pre-requisite for any national action plan to succeed against violent extremism.

This is the first set-back to the TTP and other extremist terrorist groups. This may prove to be a tipping point for the country completely exhausted by the decades of religious extremism and violent radicalism.

NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas — A fury of flames destroyed two popular New Braunfels restaurants in a matter of weeks.

The latest fire happened Monday night at ‘Cancun Mexican Restaurant.’ The other fire happened at the end of October at ‘Old River City Cafe.’ The investigations are underway for both fires. New Braunfels Fire Chief Ruy Lozano told KENS 5 the fires are not connected, but said there are similarities.

Lozano talked about his crews showing up to the fire at Cancun off South Seguin Avenue after 11:30 Monday night. He said the roof collapsed and they had to bring in an excavator to help fight the fire.

“You can see the fire really took over the structure and made it unsafe for us,” he said. “After a roof collapse you don’t want to put any more firefighters inside.""

Lozano’s crews have been busy, lately. On October 30, Old River City Cafe on FM 725 caught fire. The flames showed no mercy. He said a quick-thinking call from an incident commander saved the lives of firefighters.

“He called for an evacuation,” he said. “After two minutes of getting all the firefighters out, it collapsed. We are very fortunate.”

For both restaurants, Lozano said the fire appears to have started in or near the kitchen.

“Right now, we have no reason to believe they are suspicious or that they are connected,” he said.

Meanwhile on Tuesday night, the New Braunfels community showed up at Krause's Cafe for a fundraiser benefiting the owner and staff of Old River City Cafe. Shari Segalle is the owner of the restaurant, which was founded in 1995, according to the eatery’s website.

“It was a building,” Segalle said. “Still got the heartbeat. The heartbeat is still going. It is amazing.”

Segalle referring to the community as the heartbeat. She said her customers are family. Right now, she is also feeling for the owners of Cancun Mexican Restaurant. She knows what they are going through right now.

“It is hard a thing,” she said. “So hard. My support and prayers are going out to them.”

In the meantime, Segalle is leaning on the town’s support and her faith to move forward.

“It is going to be okay,” the owner said. “It is going to be okay. I don’t know what my future holds. But I know who holds my future.”

As for the future of Old River City Cafe, Segalle said there is a possibility to rebuild. The current building is not salvageable. She does have a catering aspect to her business which is helping as well.",Q4
https://kesq.com/news/2022/10/31/palm-springs-quadruple-murder-re-trial-testimony-resumes-monday/,Palm Springs quadruple murder re-trial: undercover agent testifies,"An undercover agent gave testimony Monday about what an accused quadruple murderer told him while he was posing as an inmate in jail.

Jose Larin Garcia is accused of murdering four people in Palm Springs in 2019. His first trial ended with a deadlocked jury.

While being recorded and observed by undercover agents in his jail cell, Larin Garcia revealed some key information for jurors to now consider, but stopped short of confessing to the crimes.

Undercover agent ""John Doe"" took the stand Monday. He spent four hours in a Banning jail cell with Larin Garcia the day after four people were murdered in February 2019.

Doe conducted what's called a ""Perkins"" operation, in which law enforcement officers portray inmates to try to elicit information from suspected criminals.

As the two developed a relationship, Larin Garcia told the agent he was ""looking at life"" in prison.

When officers announced he was being booked on murder charges, Doe said Larin Garcia's reaction was ""odd,"" and that he ""took it in stride"" without being upset or angry about being in custody.

Doe called the response inconsistent, in his experience, with someone who is innocent.

Larin Garcia claimed several times in the cell he's innocent, though Doe said, ""It was just words coming out of his mouth...It definitely didn't convince me.""

But Doe saw Larin Garcia's demeanor shift dramatically when law enforcement said his mother could possibly be charged with a crim. Larin Garcia said, ""She had nothing to do it, she didn't know.""

Talking about the strength of his case, Larin Garcia said he was ""screwed."" He also lied to the agents about seeing his mother after the killings.

Doe said at no point did Larin Garcia mention John Olvera, the man the defense says committed the murders, and never mentioned that he was in fear for his life and had to flee town.

BACKGROUND:

Jose Larin Garcia, a Cathedral City man, is accused of killing four people (ages 17-25): Carlos Campos, Jacob Montgomery, Yuliana Garcia and Juan Duarte Raya nearly four years ago.

Jose Larin Garcia, 23

The four victims were all found shot and killed on the night of February 3rd, 2019.

Three of the victims were found inside a car that crashed at Sunny Dunes and El Placer roads. The fourth victim was discovered in the street on Canon Dr. few blocks away.

When police arrived on scene, they found Larin Garcia hiding under a truck. They say he appeared intoxicated and covered in blood.

Larin Garcia was taken to Desert Regional Medical Center for treatment. Security footage shows him running from the hospital later that night.

Detectives have testified he then went to a friend’s house who he had buy him a one-way bus ticket to Florida using a fake name. Prosecutors say he was preparing to flee – shaving his head and beard to change his appearance. He was arrested waiting at the bus stop.

Larin Garcia is charged with four counts of murder. He also faces a special-circumstance allegation of committing multiple murders, opening him to the death penalty if convicted.

WEEK 4 IN COURT:

A friend of Larin Garcia's told the jury that the defendant showed him a gun and threatened to kill someone just days before the murders.

A PSPD detective testified about evidence she collected from the scene and security video she retrieved of Larin Garcia running out of the hospital.

A girlfriend of one of the victims' spoke about showing police Facebook messages sent the night of the murders regarding the fentanyl drug deal at the heart of these murders.

The man the defense says claimed responsibility for the murders testified he did not kill the four victims in this case.

WEEK 3 IN COURT:

Last week, a family friend who harbored Larin Garcia after he fled the from the hospital testified. The jury also heard from the investigator who arrested him later that night at an Indio bus stop.

Larin Garcia's mother took the stand, revealing he called her the night of the murders and she brought him clothes and a cell phone after he ran from the hospital.

Medical examiners testified the victims were all killed instantly by gunshot wounds to the head.

A friend of the defendant spoke about a key phone call she got from the defendant just after the murders happened.

WEEK 2 IN COURT:

The jury heard from a police investigator and a friend of some of the victims.

A hospital nurse who treated Larin Garcia as a trauma patient the night of the murders testified he ran from the emergency department.

A Palm Springs police officer gave testimony key to the defense argument that another man carried out the shootings.

The jury was brought on-location to the scene of the crimes.

WEEK 1 IN COURT:

During opening statements, prosecutor and Deputy District Attorney Samantha Paixao asked the jury to hold Larin Garcia responsible for the four lives she said he stole.

Defense attorney John Patrick Dolan argued that another man, John Olvera, was responsible for the murders.

The jury heard from some of the first people on scene after the murders, including neighbors who saw the dead bodies and the police officer who first made contact with the suspect.",Q4
https://www.wxyz.com/news/how-governor-whitmer-and-gubernatorial-candidate-dixon-are-spending-their-final-campaign-days,How Governor Whitmer and Gubernatorial Candidate Dixon are spending their final campaign days,"DETROIT — With only a few days until the midterm election, both Governor Gretchen Whitmer and gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon are working around the clock to secure every vote they can.

Saturday Dixon spent the afternoon in Zeeland holding a rally while Whitmer spent the evening in Detroit.

At Dixon's rally the crowd was cheering to the sounds of country music, while Whitmer walked out to the Gmac Cash song, ""Gretch Did.""

Each candidate hosted a variety of guests at their rally, Kerry Washington spoke at Whitmer's while Dixon brought each of her young daughter's and husband on stage to say hi.

The most recent poll conducted by Cyngal on Thursday shows Whitmer's lead has slipped over Dixon in the final weeks from a 6.4 lead to a 4.4 lead.

Nearly 50% of respondents favored Whitmer, while 45.5% said they favored Dixon, and 2% said they would vote third party.

Detroit Clerk Janice Winfrey has said she anticipates a large vote in Detroit voter turn out this year.

Detroit is a major player in Democratic votes.

When asked what she is doing to get those voters to show up on Tuesday, Governor Whitmer said; ""I think just being here at the museum and recognizing that this is a historic place and a really important city in the state of Michigan. Having people like President Obama coming in and Kerry Washington, what we have seen is a lot of energy.""

When asked what she is doing to ensure her supporters show up on Tuesday, Dixon said; ""We’re going to make sure to talk to folks like you everyday, we’ll be out there on radio, we’ll be out there on our bus tour and we’re going to make sure that we continue with advertising. We feel like those silent republicans are really out there.""

Most all recent polls still show Governor Whitmer as leading by a small margin, but some polls point to the gubernatorial race being locked in dead heat, abortion and schools remain key vote tipping issues.

At her Saturday rally Dixon said; ""This is about making sure that not only are our kids learning the right stuff in school, but that they’re actually learning in school.""

At her Saturday rally Whitmer said; ""My opponent wants to take us backward, backward 91 years and take away our right to make decisions about our own bodies, backward to decades of disinvestment when it comes to roads.""

STOCKTON, Calif. — 43-year-old Wesley Brownlee is expected to make his first court appearance Tuesday where he will be arraigned on charges connected to Stockton's serial killings.

A close family member, who didn't want to be identified, said Brownlee has worked full-time as a truck driver.

The family member said he was a ""goodhearted person"" and that police ""have the wrong person."" They said Brownlee has been a responsible caregiver for ill relatives as well.

Police Chief Stan McFadden wholeheartedly disagrees.

""This person was near perfect... didn't make many mistakes, purposely stayed in the dark. For law enforcement and the community to come together and make this arrest is just phenomenal,"" McFadden said.

The family member wasn't sure if the family will be attending Brownlee's arraignment tomorrow.

Brownlee is no stranger to the court system. His court records in San Joaquin County date back to 2009, where he was charged with a misdemeanor DUI. In 2010, a temporary restraining order was granted in a civil case against Brownlee to stay away from some of his own family.

However, about three weeks later, it was dismissed.

In January last year, he incurred an infraction for ""unlawful disobey a specified sign, signal or traffic control device"" and was fined. On June 30 of this year, he was pulled over for speeding and entered a ""not guilty"" plea.

However, his court cases don't end in San Joaquin County. He has a number of other charges in Alameda County. In September 1997, he was charged with two felony drug charges, pleading no contest to possession of a controlled substance. In October 1997, he had a conviction for ""possession for sale of a controlled substance.""

He was sentenced to two years in state prison and three years probation.

In April 2014, there was another felony charge for ""possession for sale of cocaine."" By June 2014, he plead ""no contest"" to ""sale of a controlled substance"" amounting to 16 days in the county jail and five years probation.

In 2019 in Cochise County, Arizona, he was fined for failing ""to stop at port of entry.""

Two visitors who survived a serious crash in Sandys returned to the island to thank their rescuers.

Susan and Chris Miliner came to Bermuda on a cruise ship on June 29 last year, but they had a brush with disaster only a few hours into their trip when they crashed their rental cycle into a wall near the bottom of Scaur Hill.

The couple were thrown over the wall and plunged more than 20 feet on to the rocky shoreline below.

While Mr Miliner’s injuries were not considered to be life-threatening, Mrs Miliner was taken to King Edward VII Memorial Hospital’s Intensive Care Unit suffering from a serious head injury.

She was eventually flown to the United States for medical treatment while still on life support.

A police spokesman said on social media that Pc Rajiv Bailey, who had been one of the attending officers at the collision, was surprised to receive an unexpected text message from Mrs Miliner several weeks ago.

“During their time in hospital locally, Pc Bailey, who was one of the attending officers at the collision, acted as a self-appointed liaison, assisting Chris and other members of their family while they were on the island,” the spokesman said.

“The Miliners did not let their bad experience spoil their desire to visit the island and once well enough to travel again, decided they were going on another cruise to Bermuda.

“Susan sent Pc Bailey a text, stating that she remembered nothing about the accident, but had been told about his kindness by her husband. She also insisted they meet on the couple’s return, so she could thank him personally.”

The couple arrived back in Bermuda last Tuesday and were met on the dock by Pc Bailey, who took them to meet the doctors, nurses, firefighters and emergency medical technicians who had helped them following their crash.

“Susan’s story is nothing short of a miracle, as she explained to officers that she was left with a traumatic brain injury, resulting in her having to learn to walk and talk again,” the spokesman said.

“She admits that she still has some minor challenges as a result of the injury, but she isn’t letting it stop her from living her life.

“Although the accident was a life-altering experience for the couple, they joked about having T-shirts at home that say, ‘I Survived a Bermuda Moped’.”",Q4
https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/iran-has-charged-1-000-people-over-the-unrest-in-tehran-and-reportedly-plans-to-hold-public-trials/1z62tzith,"Iran has charged 1,000 people over the unrest in Tehran and reportedly plans to hold public trials","Iran's hardline judiciary will hold public trials of about 1,000 people indicted for unrest in Tehran, a semi-official news agency said on Monday, intensifying efforts to crush weeks of protests ignited by Mahsa Amini's death in police custody.





One of the boldest challenges to Iran's clerical leaders since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the almost seven-week-old protests have persisted despite a deadly crackdown and increasingly severe warnings, with the Revolutionary Guards bluntly telling demonstrators to stay off the streets.





The judiciary denied that a sentence had been issued yet to a man it said was arrested during riots and accused of hitting and killing a police officer with his car and injuring five other officers after a woman identifying herself as his mother said the man had been sentenced to death in an initial court hearing.



Iranian leaders have vowed tough action against protesters they have described as rioters, blaming enemies including the United States of fomenting the unrest.





Protesters from all walks of life have taken part, with students and women playing a prominent role, waving and burning headscarves since the 22-year-old Amini died in the custody of morality police who arrested her for ""inappropriate attire"".





The semi-official Tasnim news agency, citing Tehran's chief justice, said the trials of about 1,000 people ""who have carried out acts of sabotage in recent events, including assaulting or martyring security guards, (and) setting fire to public property"" would take place in a Revolutionary Court.





The trials had been scheduled for this week and would be held in public, it said.





It was not immediately clear if the 1,000 indictments announced on Monday included 315 protesters whom the official IRNA news agency reported on Saturday had been charged in Tehran, at least five of whom are accused of capital offences.



The judiciary said no sentence had been handed yet to 22-year-old Mohammad Ghobadlou - the man it accused of driving into the police officers. It said he was accused of ""corruption on earth"" - a capital offence.





In a court session partly broadcast by Iranian state TV on Saturday, Mr Ghobadlou had said he had lost control of his car and hit someone who fell on his windshield and broke it after which he was then unable to see anything. ""I came out of the car and put my hands on my head (to surrender),"" he said.





Reuters was not immediately able to contact his family or a lawyer representing him on Monday.





Earlier, in a video shared on social media, the woman identified as his mother had said that he had been sentenced to death in the hearing two days earlier and that the court dismissed his lawyers.





""My son is ill, court doesn't even allow his lawyer to enter the courtroom...They have interrogated him without an attorney present and, in the very first session, sentenced him to death and wanting to execute this ASAP,"" said the woman, who did not give her name.





Reuters could not independently verify her account nor that of the judiciary.





Stepping up warnings against the protesters, Revolutionary Guards commander Hossein Salami warned them on Saturday not to take to the streets, declaring it the ""last day of the riots"" .





Saeid Golkar of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga said the warning was a clear message the Islamic Republic saw the protests ""as a very regime-threatening event"". Continued protests are a ""sign that people are more determined to challenge the regime compared to the past"", he said.





""Unfortunately..., history has shown us they are willing to use any level of violence to stay in power.""





Meir Javedanfar, Iran Lecturer at Reichman University in Israel, said the official warnings pointed to growing state concern about the resilience of the unrest, ""the fact that despite early predictions by some regime officials, these protests are not dying down"".



In this photo taken by an individual not employed by the Associated Press and obtained by the AP outside Iran, Iranians protests the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini after she was detained by the morality police, in Tehran, 1 October, 2022. Source: AAP / AP The Revolutionary Guards, Iran's elite military and security force, have yet to be used to quell the unrest. So far, the authorities have mostly drawn on riot police and volunteer Basij militia to crush the protests.





The activist HRANA news agency said on Sunday 284 protesters had been killed in the unrest, including 45 minors. Some 36 members of the security forces were also killed.







Footage shared by 1500tasvir showed people running away from a commemoration in the city of Shahriar near Tehran for a man killed in protests 40 days ago, with a voice saying they were fleeing an attack by security forces. Earlier videos showed dozens of mourners at the gathering, shouting slogans calling for the death of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.





Reuters could not verify the footage.





The protests have been fuelled by the deaths of several teenage girls reportedly killed while demonstrating.





On Monday, people chanted against the government during a gathering at the grave of a 16-year-old Kurdish girl killed by security forces in the city of Sanandaj, capital of Kurdistan province, according to rights organisation Hengaw.





State media reported that WhatsApp and Instagram — both owned by Meta Platforms (META.O) - would continue to be blocked, accusing the companies of failing to cooperate ""with the laws of the Islamic Republic"".

https://themilitant.com/2022/11/12/expand-the-reach-of-socialist-workers-party-the-militant/,"Expand the reach of Socialist Workers Party, the ‘Militant’ – The Militant","Socialist Workers Party candidates and supporters used the final days before the Nov. 8 elections to discuss with fellow working people what we can do together to stand up to bosses’ moves to push the deepening capitalist crisis onto our backs.

In Lake Station, Indiana, SWP members Dan Fein and Leroy Watson spoke with Tyler McChristian and his stepmother, Nana McChristian, on their doorstep Oct. 30.

Tyler works at McDonald’s for $12.65 an hour. “Our wages need to go up. Prices go up on everything,” he said.

“That’s right,” Watson said, “the working class needs escalator clauses in union contracts, on Social Security and disability, so wages go up every time prices rise.

“We’ll get nowhere if we depend on politicians,” Tyler said. “Only workers can solve our problems.”

“I’ve been working since I was 14 years old, much of that time as a nurse,” Nana McChristian said. “Now I have cancer and my health insurance says they will not pay for my treatment.”

After getting a subscription to the Militant, she asked Fein for a few subscription forms. “I’ve got friends who work in the steel mill who will be interested in getting the Militant. It sounds like it’s just what we need.”

On Nov. 6 Deborah Liatos, SWP candidate for Congress from California, campaigned at a farmers’ market in Oxnard, northwest of Los Angeles. Several farmers told her that water restrictions are forcing farmers to limit what they plant. Xochiti and Charles Beckley were selling produce they grow on a quarter acre at their house. They told Liatos that Xochiti’s parents worked as farmworkers all their lives. “The biggest challenges for farmworkers are benefits and resources,” Xochiti Beckley said. “They are tough jobs and don’t pay enough.”

“Workers and farmers need to mobilize to fight for our rights, gain confidence in ourselves,” Liatos said. “We need to take power into our hands and run society in the interests of the vast majority.” The Beckleys got a subscription to the Militant to learn more.

The campaign of Gabrielle Prosser, SWP candidate for governor of Minnesota, who is on the ballot, continues to get press coverage, introducing the party’s program broadly. “Gubernatorial candidate Gabrielle Prosser: DFL, GOP both spell ‘boss.’ I’ll work for workers,” was the headline of her opinion piece printed in the Star Tribune Nov. 4.

“We live in a class-divided society,” Prosser writes. “Both the Democratic and Republican parties defend the interests of the bosses. The program of the Socialist Workers Party says workers need our own party, a labor party, based on the unions.”

SWP and Communist League members in Australia, Canada and the U.K. are in the final week of the fall campaign to sell 1,350 Militant subscriptions and 1,350 books by SWP leaders and others offering a revolutionary road forward.

There have been a series of demonstrations in the Louisville, Kentucky, area since the death of Mahsa Amini Sept. 16 after her arrest by the “morality” police in Iran. “Women are half the world,” Niloofar Sabzevari told Betsy Farley, an SWP member from Cincinnati, at an action Oct. 29. “We deserve to be treated with respect. I don’t understand why women are treated so badly.”

“The bosses make profits off women’s second-class status,” Farley said. “They pay us less and push us out of the workforce when they don’t need us. During the COVID pandemic many women had to leave the workforce to take care of children, the sick and the elderly.”

Sabzevari said she has met many newly arrived refugees from Afghanistan at the bank where she works. “I don’t care how refugees got here,” she said. “Once they are here, they should have equal rights.”

“We’re not for open borders, but our party fights for an amnesty for all immigrants who are in the country,” Farley said, “It’s part of the fight to unite the working class.”

After looking over the Militant, Sabzevari decided to subscribe.

In the U.S. the SWP is reaching out to raise $140,000 for its fall Party-Building Fund. The party is entirely funded by working people, who contribute whatever they can to help finance its work. An appeal at a Militant Labor Forum in Chicago raised $300.

Prior to his election to Alabama’s Fifth Congressional District this month, Strong received the 45th president’s endorsement. In singing Strong’s praises, Trump said the then-congressional nominee “was with us from the beginning.”

In announcing his support for Trump’s campaign, Strong touted the former president’s accomplishments relating to border security and the economy. The congressman-elect invited Trump to hold another “huge rally” in North Alabama.

“Donald Trump has my full endorsement in his campaign for President. In the White House he closed our borders, brought back thousands of American jobs and had the economy growing like never before,” wrote Strong in a Facebook post. “I was honored to have President Trump’s endorsement in my campaign and invite him to return to north Alabama any time for another huge rally! MAGA!!”

Strong, as chairman of the Madison County Commission, emerged as one of the first elected officials in Alabama to publicly support Trump’s bid in the 2016 GOP presidential primary. As part of his efforts to bolster Trump’s candidacy in the Yellowhammer State, Strong helped organize a campaign rally at Madison City Stadium.

Strong joins U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Auburn) in being among the first members of Alabama’s congressional delegation to publicly endorse Trump’s bid for a second term as president.

The girl died of neck compressions and stab wounds, the chief medical examiner's office said.

The new law, which was signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul and takes effect in 2024, lets pet shops work instead with shelters to offer rescued or abandoned animals up for adoption. It will also ban breeders from selling more than nine animals a year.

Pet shops have argued that the law will do nothing to shut down out-of-state breeders or increase their standards of care and said it would result in the closures of the dozens of pet stores remaining in New York.

New York on Thursday became the latest state to ban the sale of cats, dogs and rabbits in pet stores in an attempt to target commercial breeding operations decried by critics as “puppy mills.""

The new law, which was signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul and takes effect in 2024, lets pet shops work instead with shelters to offer rescued or abandoned animals up for adoption. It will also ban breeders from selling more than nine animals a year.

“This is a very big deal. New York tends to be a big purchaser and profiteer of these mills, and we are trying to cut off the demand at a retail level,” said Sen. Michael Gianaris, a Democrat.

He added that the the puppy mill industry treats animals “like commodities” and said “there is no pet store not affected.”

Pet shops have argued that the law will do nothing to shut down out-of-state breeders or increase their standards of care and said it would result in the closures of the dozens of pet stores remaining in New York.

California enacted a similar law in 2017, becoming the first state to ban such sales. While that law requires pet stores to work with animal shelters or rescue operations, like New York is doing now, it does not regulate sales by private breeders.

A handful of states followed. In 2020, Maryland banned the sale of cats and dogs in pet stores, triggering pushback from shop owners and breeders who challenged the measure in court. A year later Illinois barred pet shops from selling commercially raised puppies and kittens.

In New York, pet advocacy groups have long called for a full shutdown of facilities that raise and sell animals for profit, saying animals are raised in inhumane conditions before they are shipped off to stores.

Emilio Ortiz, a manager at Citipups pet shop in New York City, said the new law could serve as a death sentence for the business he’s worked at for more than a decade.

“Ninety percent of our business is selling dogs. We’re not going to survive this,” said Ortiz, who considers the ban unfair to stores that work with responsible breeders. “They’re closing the good actors along with the bad actors.”

Jessica Selmer, president of People United to Protect Pet Integrity, a New York coalition of pet store owners, called the law “careless” and “counterproductive” and said she hopes the governor will “consider legislative remedies to some of the pitfalls of the bill.”

The new law will not affect at-home breeders who sell animals born and raised on their property.

Lisa Haney, who breeds dogs at her Buffalo home alongside her husband, said she supports the law.

“One pet store near me, they get dogs from all over the Midwest and different large facilities, and you have no idea where they come from and who the breeder is. People are really clueless and take the puppy,” Haney said.

Her business, Cavapoo Kennels, partly focuses on breeding hypoallergenic dogs for people who have allergies, and her business model operates on a need basis. The waitlist runs from six to 12 months, ensuring each dog ends up in a home.

Gianaris said the law will allow buyers to be more conscious of where their pets come from.

“If a consumer went to a mill and saw the awful conditions, they wouldn’t buy these animals,” he said. “Dealing with a breeder allows people to see where their dog comes from, and it cuts off the middle men that serve as a way to wash off the awful activities that take place at the mill.”

Emilia ""Amy"" Marin, a school staffer at Robb Elementary, speaks with ABC News' John Quinones about her struggles after the shooting.

Emilia ""Amy"" Marin, a school staffer at Robb Elementary, speaks with ABC News' John Quinones about her struggles after the shooting.

Emilia ""Amy"" Marin watched a briefing on the Robb Elementary school shooting on May 27, three days after the rampage that killed 19 students and two teachers.

She listened live as Col. Steven McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, told dozens of reporters and millions of viewers watching live that a ""teacher"" had propped the door open with a rock, allowing the shooter to enter the school through a door that was supposed to lock automatically.

""He's lying. That's a lie,"" Marin said to her daughter, who was watching with her.

Though unnamed at the time, Marin was the woman McCraw was talking about. Marin was an afterschool program coordinator at the time of the Robb shooting.

Months later, Marin is still waiting to hear how and why the false accusation was broadcast to the nation.

Emilia ""Amy"" Marin, a school staffer at Robb Elementary, speaks with ABC News' John Quinones about her struggles after the shooting. ABC News

""Nobody is going to point the finger at me because I know what I did,"" Marin told ABC News correspondent John Quiñones. ""I knew what I did from day one.""

Three days later, DPS retracted that statement, but that was not until after many in the community had blamed Marin for the attack. In the months since, community members and state politicians have criticized DPS for that mistake.

""They're either incompetent or they are dishonest,"" said Don Flanary, Marin's lawyer, about the department. ""Neither is acceptable.""

DPS has not offered an explanation on how the error was made or the route it took to reach McCraw. DPS officials declined to respond to questions for this report about the origin of the mistake and have referred ABC News to the agency's prior statements and apology.

In a previous statement to ABC News, DPS spokesman Travis Considine explained: ""At the outset of the investigation, DPS reported that an unnamed teacher at Robb Elementary School used a rock to prop open the door that the shooter used to enter the school building. It was later determined that the same teacher removed the rock from the doorway prior to the arrival of the shooter, and closed the door, unaware that the door was unlocked.""

Considine said, ""DPS corrected this error in public announcements and testimony and apologizes to the teacher and her family for the additional grief this has caused to an already horrific situation.""

McCraw testified during a state Public Safety Commission hearing last week. ""At the time, that's exactly the information that we had. It was wrong,"" he said. ""I take responsibility for it.""

Security camera footage obtained by ABC News shows Marin placing the rock in the doorway only to return and kick it away a few minutes later. She closed the door behind her.

""If you're an investigator, you're sitting there watching that video and you saw me walk out,"" Marin told ABC News. ""Why didn't you sit there and watch the whole video to see if I ran back in?""

""Obviously I should have apologized a lot sooner,"" McCraw said at that public safety meeting. ""I did say the teacher pushed the rock or put placed the rock in the door. I said that on that Friday and didn't correct it until the next week.""

During last week's hearing, state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, who represents Uvalde, said Marin was deeply traumatized by the assertion that her actions gave a killer access to Robb Elementary.

""She was haunted by this in her own hometown,"" Gutierrez told ABC news.

""And that happened because (DPS) defamed her,"" he said. ""They defamed her.""

In this May 27, 2022, file photo, Democratic Texas State Senator Roland Gutierrez interrupts a press conference held by Texas Governor Greg Abbott in Uvalde, Texas. Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images, FILE

Gutierrez told the commission that the explanation of a simple mistake was unconvincing and hard to believe because, in the first days after the school shooting, he said he personally watched as a team of DPS investigators reviewed surveillance camera footage closely.

In an interview with ABC News, Gutierrez elaborated, saying he watched 10 troopers in their signature DPS cowboy hats closely examining video captured that day. Though he couldn't say exactly which videos he saw them reviewing, he watched as they scrutinized the footage, repeatedly rewinding, fast-forwarding and slowing portions of video. He said the detailed analysis of the evidence that he witnessed contradicts the information McCraw was given prior to the briefing Marin watched with her daughter on May 27.

""It defies logic that these people didn't know the truth as to what Amy Marin did or didn't do,"" Gutierrez said. ""When they accused Amy Marin, they knew that she absolutely did the right thing and yet they let her feel the pain of that accusation for five days, and she will never be the same.""

Marin told ABC News that an FBI agent and a Texas Ranger interviewed her before McCraw went on television with his inaccurate statements about her actions. She told the officers at that time what happened on the day of the shooting, including her shutting the door behind her.

""They had the video and the FBI and Rangers had already interviewed her and confirmed with her that she kicked the rock out,"" said Flanary. ""It doesn't make sense.""

Jesse Rizo, the uncle of Jackie Cazares who was among the students killed at Robb, confronted McCraw at the hearing.

""Your officers either lied to you or you painted a picture that was favorable to your department,"" Rizo said to McCraw.

Marin has decided to take action in the wake of this tragedy and has filed suit against the manufacturer of the gun used in the Robb shooting. She is also considering other legal options.

It is expected that substantial additional information about the probe will be revealed once the criminal investigation is completed by the end of 2022.

Many councilmembers said they wanted to hear more information from city staff and other experts, and allow residents to comment on the item, on second reading.

City Council usually votes twice on proposed ordinances: once during the first reading, when the ordinance is grouped with other routine items on the consent agenda and passed with a single vote. The council votes individually a second time on each of the ordinances at the following regular meeting after a report from city staff.

The drafted rule says it would require abortion providers in Pueblo to comply with federal law, citing an 1873 Comstock law prohibiting the publication, distribution or possession of information about or medications or other tools for ""unlawful"" contraception or abortions.

Parts of the law banning contraception have since been overturned but other portions regarding abortion are seemingly still on record.

If it passed, the Pueblo ordinance would authorize the public, not the government, to enforce the law by suing abortion providers.

""You guys have the ability to protect your city by a simple ordinance requiring simple compliance with federal law,"" Mark Lee Dickson, a pastor and anti-abortion advocate, told the council.

Dickson has helped pass municipal abortion bans in more than 60 cities, he said, paving the way for the 2021 Texas ""heartbeat bill"" that outlawed most abortions after six weeks.

He said he helped draft the proposed Pueblo ordinance in response to an abortion clinic planned there.

There are currently no abortion clinics in Pueblo, and the nearest one is about 45 miles north in Colorado Springs.

Clinics for Abortion and Reproductive Excellence has purchased a building in Pueblo's historic Bessemer neighborhood but does not have an opening date, The Pueblo Chieftain reported. The organization also has locations in Nebraska and Maryland.

Sara Neel, senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's Colorado branch, said the drafted rule ""clearly violates"" Colorado's Reproductive Health Equity Act, passed by the state Legislature earlier this year to codify a person's ""fundamental right"" to choose to continue or terminate a pregnancy.

The state passed the legislation ahead of the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade in late June, dismantling the 50-year precedent that constitutionally protected the right to an abortion.

If Pueblo passed the ordinance it would be ""a clear contradiction to that and is going against the will of the people in Colorado,"" Neel said.

Featured Local Savings

Dickson said because federal law overrides state law, the proposed regulation should be legal.

Neel said she didn't believe the Comstock laws would apply in this case, saying courts have historically applied them to ""unlawful items.""

""Since abortion is legal and the (Food and Drug Administration) has approved the distribution of medications used for abortions as legal, I don't believe the Comstock laws would be applied in the way (proponents of the ordinance are) alleging that they do.

""It's also a bit of a stretch to say city law wouldn't be superseded by recent state law, but that state law should be superseded by federal law,"" she said.

Councilwoman Regina Maestri said she brought the document before the council on behalf of residents who are concerned about the planned abortion clinic in town.

""In order to really fight this, I did have to bring the top person in the country, because that came from a point of view from my constituents' side that is pro-life,"" she said.

Maestri said she is pro-life but is not an activist. ""But I also am on what is right, doing the right thing,"" she said.

Other councilmembers questioned the ordinance's legality.

""I think this ordinance is really tricky and I don't know if I like exactly the way this one is written,"" Council President Heather Graham said. ""But I am willing to listen and hear people come and talk, because I don't know that my mind is made up completely.""

Councilwoman Sarah Martinez said the matter was a state issue, not a municipal one. Colorado voters have already struck down three statewide anti-abortion ballot measures, most recently in 2020, with Pueblo voters also rejecting the measures, she said.

""The majority of Pueblo has repeatedly told us where they stand on this issue,"" Martinez said. ""They want abortion access.""

If passed, the Pueblo ordinance could possibly face legal challenges from the state.

""Attorney General Phil Weiser is committed to defending the Reproductive Health Equity Act and challenging any local ordinance that violates the law,"" spokesman Lawrence Pacheco said by email this week. ""The Attorney General's Office is monitoring developments regarding the proposed ordinance in Pueblo and has no further comment while it is under consideration by the Pueblo City Council.""

The Gazette's attempts to reach the Pueblo City Attorney's Office for comment were unsuccessful.

Background documents state the city's legal staff does not recommend City Council approve the ordinance, which is scheduled for second reading at the Dec. 12 regular council meeting.",Q4

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Rachel Flannery, a day care worker who was charged on Friday, Sept. 30 with criminal abuse, appeared in court Thursday morning.

Flannery was charged in relation to the assault of a 7-month-old child in her care at Vanguard Academy in Louisville.

Officials said her attorney filed a motion to have her $50,000 full cash bond reduced to $25,000. The motion was granted by the judge.

In addition, officials said Flannery's bond was posted with stipulations by the judge that Flannery be placed on the Home Incarceration Program (HIP) and ordered Flannery to have no contact with the complaining witnesses nor the victim in the case, plus no new arrests or violations of the law.

Her preliminary hearing is scheduled for Oct. 10 at 9 a.m.

Original Story

A day care worker has been charged in the abuse of three children at The Vanguard Academy.

According to arrest records, detectives said 24-year-old Racheal Flannery was shown on surveillance video shoving a bottle into the mouth of a 7-month-old, squeeze the child, swing the child around and dropping the child onto the floor. The child suffered bruises to a cheek, an arm and abrasions on their lip.

A second arrest citation details camera footage showing the suspect ""intentionally, violently handling"" another infant -- this one 6-months-old -- placing both victims in a ""situation that may cause serious physical injury or cruel punishment.""

Flannery, who was taken into custody on Friday, faces three counts of criminal abuse of a child 12-years-old or younger. She pleaded not guilty to those charges during an arraignment the following day in Jefferson Circuit Court.

Louisville attorney Alex White is representing the victim's family and said a child of one of their firm's employees was also attacked inside the day care facility, located in the Norton Commons neighborhood, days ago.

White told us that child was hospitalized overnight. He also said information from The Vanguard Academy has been ""slow and incomplete,"" saying he still has many questions as to how this happened and why the employee has been placed on indefinite leave, rather than being fired.

Meanwhile, the day care itself declined to comment on the investigation, but a letter emailed to parents offered vague details into the incident.

It reads as follows:

""Parents,

It is with great sadness we are writing this email to inform you we have reported an apparent incident that occurred at the Vanguard Academy to the proper authorities. Investigative agencies including CPS and the LMPD are involved, and we are fully cooperating with them. We are notifying all families in our community so everyone will know of this matter. We are truly saddened this has happened at our center as our top priority is keeping your children safe.""

The Vanguard Academy was operating normally on Friday.

A mother picking up her child spoke with WHAS11 but wanted to remain anonymous. She said parents like her have more questions and concerns than answers a day after receiving the letter.

""I do wish there were a few more details: What classroom the incident was involved in, if it was violence toward the child, if it was verbal, physical -- just something so that we would have less anxiety over the whole incident,"" she said. ""Now, we're all speculating. Was our child in that classroom?""

She and other parents said prior to hearing these developments, they've mostly had good experiences at the center.

Written below is White's full statement:

""We can confirm that one of the members of our office’s family was a victim in what Vanguard Academy described as “an apparent incident.” At this time our only concern is the well-being of their child. Due to over-night hospitalization the day of the attack and the severe emotional distress their family is experiencing, they are exhausted but relieved that they still have their child to hold. For the sake of privacy in this difficult time, the family wishes to remain anonymous for now.

Unfortunately, we feel that information has been slow and incomplete coming from the daycare facility and therefore we still have more questions than answers about exactly what happened, why it happened and how it was possible for something like this to happen. We are stunned that Vanguard’s position is that the employee has been placed on an “indefinite leave of absence” and not immediately terminated. We will come together to support our team member’s family in their immediate need and take fierce action in the future if justice so requires.

Anyone with information related Vanguard’s conduct is encouraged to contact LMPD and send correspondence to Alex@ARWhiteLaw.com.""

Both LMPD's Office of Sexual and Physical Abuse Investigations and the Kentucky Office of the Inspector General is looking into the case.

by Fabien Lemercier

07/12/2022 - Bérénice Bejo and young actors Leah Aubert, Medina Diarra and Salma Takaline all star in the director’s first feature film, produced by Manny Films and sold by Memento International

After a four-week film shoot in Sens in October, Nora El Hourch’s debut feature film Sisterhood is now in post-production. Highly remarked upon for her short film Quelques secondes (unveiled in the Directors’ Fortnight in 2015 before screening in Toronto and at the BFI London Film Festival, among other events), the filmmaker has assembled a cast including Bérénice Bejo (awarded the Best Actress trophy in Cannes 2013 for The Past , as well as a César in the same category in 2012 and a nomination for the Best Supporting Role Oscar in the same year for The Artist ; recently seen in Toronto and Rome via The Hummingbird ) and youngsters Leah Aubert, Medina Diarra (The African Doctor ) and Salma Takaline.

(The article continues below - Commercial information)

Written by Nora El Hourch herself, together with Eléonore Gurrey (who co-penned The Worst Ones ), the story revolves around Amina, Djeneba and Zineb, three inseparable teens who post a video on social media challenging the person who attacked one of them: a kingpin on a local housing estate. The film explores the consequences of this militant act, as well as issues around social class and identity, and highlights the social and cultural divide which exists between the three friends. They will need to choose between saving their friendship or giving into pressure… Bérénice Bejo plays the lawyer mother of one of the three college girls.

Sisterhood is produced by Philippe Gompel on behalf of Manny Films, in co-production with Moroccan firm La Prod (Lamia Chraibi). Pre-purchased by Amazon Prime Video, the movie also enjoys support from the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region, where the film in its entirety was shot, with Maxence Lemonnier in charge of photography. Sales are steered by Memento International while distribution in French cinemas falls to Paname Distribution.

For the record, Manny Films recently co-produced the American movie Cherry by French director Sophie Galibert (awarded the Online Premieres Audience Award at this year’s Tribeca Festival). The French firm are also involved in Titanic Ocean by Greece’s Konstantina Kotzamani, a production which has just received support from Eurimages (read our news), which involves five European countries (Greece, France, Romania, Germany and Spain), and on which filming is due to kick off in the spring.

https://mynorthwest.com/3676480/attorney-seattle-created-dangerous-situation-leading-to-chop-murder/,Attorney: Seattle created ‘dangerous situation’ leading to CHOP murder,"Updated: 12:00 noon Oct. 19, 2022

On June 20, 2020, a 19-year-old man was killed inside the city’s Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP) zone, an area that formed after protests took over Seattle over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

On surveillance video, the man, Lorenzo Anderson, was seen being shot. Marcel Long has been charged with the crime and is awaiting trial.

Now, a lawsuit is being filed by Lorenzo’s family against the city of Seattle.

Lawsuit seeks to hold the city accountable

Phil Talmadge, a former Washington state Supreme Court justice, and Mark Lindquist, a former Pierce County District Attorney, are representing Donnitta Sinclair, Anderson’s mother. They said the city should be held accountable for the shooting.

The case is being heard in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Key points of the prosecution’s case

On the Dori Monson Show Monday, Dori asked Lindquist what the key points of his case were.

“Number one, the city created a dangerous situation by abandoning this entire section of the city,” Lindquist said. “And number two, the city failed to prepare for the inevitable violence. Lorenzo was bleeding out for 15 to 20 minutes, and the city failed to get him medical assistance.”

Dori recalled, “The warlords who had taken over that part of Capitol Hill, they weren’t allowing the police in. I’ve watched a lot of the video that night, and there were very active efforts to keep the cops from going in and escorting the medical personnel.”

Lindquist: ‘The city had no plan’

Dori asked if that mitigated exposure.

“No, because the city had no plan in place to deal with its inevitable violence,” Lindquist explained. “It’s going to erupt when you have an entire area of lawlessness. It’s on the city, they need to have a plan.”

Dori said it was a mistake for six square blocks to be turned over to people with “anarchist ideals.”

“Of course, the police knew this. (Seattle Mayor) Jenny Durkan knew this,” Dori said. “When she goes on CNN and declares it a possible ‘Summer of Love.’ I just cannot believe the unfathomable stupidity of her saying something like that at the beginning of this.”

“That was a point actually, that Phil (Talmadge) made to the judges, which not only did the city create this danger, they downplayed the danger,” Lindquist responded. “And beyond that, they refer to it as a ‘Summer of Love’ and a block party. And Lorenzo is a special needs teenager. And that’s what he thinks he’s getting into.”

Dori: “It’s impossible to defend anything that the city did. And what makes [this] even more outrageous is that things that might have explained the decision making, giving up the East Precinct to not show any resistance to these domestic terrorists.” Dori said conversations probably existed at one time in text messages, that Jenny Durkin, then-Seattle Police Chief) Carmen Best, and (Seattle Fire Chief Harold) Scoggins, as well as a bunch of other city leaders, destroyed.

‘Evidence disappearing’ is frowned upon

Dori went on to say that he thought city leaders were going to get off “scot-free and that it is a felony to destroy things that are subject to public records acts.”

“You know, I don’t know if they’re gonna get off scot-free,” Lindquist said. “One of the judges noticed that this had happened. And he was talking about this as spoliation. In other words, this is evidence that can be used against the city, in this lawsuit and in other lawsuits as well. It’s a major problem for the city. Judges take a dim view of evidence disappearing, obviously.

“Our only avenue for accountability (for the shooting) is through this lawsuit. But there are other avenues of accountability for the disappearance of these text messages, which were on government phones, so they’re public records. This is being investigated.”

Dori wanted to know what the city’s defense would be.

“Initially, the city tried to defend CHOP and that obviously wasn’t going over with the judges,” said Lindquist. “The danger was not specific towards this victim. In other words, it’s okay to create a danger as long as you don’t target a specific individual. I don’t think that’s the law. And if it is the law, that’s horrible public policy.”

Next stage is discovery

Dori asked about what the next stage will be.

“The next stage is we’ll be getting into discovery,” explained Lindquist. “That means that I’ll be able to depose and interview some of the city officials involved and will request those text messages that apparently disappeared and we’ll gather evidence and see what we can [get]. Part of our goal here is justice, obviously, and accountability.

“But also, we want to flush out the truth.”

According to a news release from the State Attorney's Office of the 14th Judicial Circuit, James Wakefield, 42, of Panama City was sentenced Tuesday by Circuit Judge Timothy Register to serve 35 years in prison.

Wakefield was arrested in 2020 for possessing heroin and small bags holding more than 50 grams of methamphetamine. He also had more than 30 previous felony convictions.

Prosecutor Frank Sullivan shows jurors drugs and evidence during the Tuesday sentencing of James Wakefield, a 42-year-old Panama City resident.

""I have to consider the criminal history, which does show quite a history of burglaries and grand thefts and tampering and so on,"" Register said.

Wakefield received a 30-year sentence, which includes a mandatory minimum of seven years, for the methamphetamine. He also received five years, which will run concurrent with the first sentence, for possessing heroin.

During the Tuesday sentencing, prosecutors presented four witnesses. They were three investigators with the Bay County Sheriff's Office and an expert from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

According to the release, BCSO Sgt. Steve Cook testified that another man was found in possession of a smaller amount of methamphetamine during a traffic stop earlier that same day. They identified Wakefield ""as a large supplier.""

That man later in the day was contacted by Wakefield, who asked him to bring a tool needed to fix his truck, which broke down on U.S. 231 near State Road 20. Cook testified the man brought Wakefield the tool and then confirmed with BCSO that Wakefield was in possession of a large amount of methamphetamine.

""Cook testified that when he exited his vehicle and identified himself (to Wakefield) as a law enforcement officer, (Wakefield) turned around and began to walk away, reaching into the front of his pants and throwing down a large baggie that contained multiple smaller baggies of methamphetamine and one of heroin,"" the release reads.

""(Wakefield's) defense alleged the cooperating witness planted the drugs himself under direction of a 'crooked' cop, but the state and ultimately the jury discounted that claim.""

SALT LAKE CITY — Cynthia Vincent sobbed as 3rd District Judge Paul Parker sentenced her to a term of one to 15 years in prison for the death of her husband, 57-year-old Michael Vincent.

""All I can say is I'm sorry,"" the 42-year-old told the judge through tears minutes earlier. ""I didn't want any of this. ... I was just scared.""

Parker's decision came at the end of an emotionally charged sentencing Monday that included widely differing accounts of who Michael Vincent was and his actions leading up to the moment that Cynthia Vincent shot him on July 6, 2021.

Defense attorney David Clark characterized him as an abusive ""wife-beater"" who had been investigated for a homicide.. But Michael Vincent's family members testified that he was a loving father and grandfather, an active community member who taught self-defense classes to kids.

Cynthia Vincent was arrested and charged with murder six months after Michael Vincent's death.

On July 6, Unified police were called to Vincent's House of Goju, 9145 W. Main in Magna, after Cynthia Vincent called 911 to report that she had shot her husband.

Michael Vincent was found deceased just inside the entrance of the business, where the couple also lived.

When interviewed by police, Vincent ""asserted that she and Michael had been fighting all weekend. Vincent stated that shortly before the shooting, Michael had assaulted and strangled her,"" according to charging documents.

Vincent told detectives that she had called a friend to pick her up and then told her husband that a friend was on the way. That's when she said Michael Vincent lunged at her and she fired a shot, according to the charges.

But prosecutors say when Cynthia Vincent apparently realized that where Michael Vincent's body was found didn't match up to where she said she shot him, she tried to explain again what had happened.

""Vincent tried to explain the events again but appeared to be guessing at where they were standing during the shooting. Vincent's recollection of the events was not supported by evidence. The evidence is consistent with Michael leaving through the front door of the business when he was shot in the side of the head,"" the charges state.

Investigators also learned that the call Vincent made to her friends to pick her up was made just one minute or less before she called 911.

Detectives reviewed security video from the house which showed Vincent and her husband ""doing chores and interacting normally"" the day before on July 5. Even as late as two hours before the shooting, Michael Vincent is seen on video kissing his wife, the charges say.

""Following this incident, she attempted to gain access to and close financial accounts that she previously shared with the victim. She was unable to do so as the victim removed (her) from the accounts prior to his death,"" the charges state.

Prosecutors later reduced the charge to manslaughter, a second-degree felony, under Utah's imperfect self-defense law, which Parker explained means it was reasonable for Vincent to believe she had to defend herself but she wasn't actually in any danger. Vincent pleaded guilty in October.

'I'm never going to understand'

Clark said Vincent is a domestic violence survivor who recognizes she shouldn't have shot her husband but who didn't feel safe.

Vincent ""had to make an agonizing decision,"" Clark said, and was acting in good faith.

He stated multiple times that Michael Vincent was a ""wife-beater"" and a ""girlfriend-beater,"" and said he was a fourth-degree black belt who had been drinking and smoking marijuana the night of his death. Clark also repeatedly emphasized that Vincent had been the subject of a homicide investigation.

Cynthia Vincent is not a danger to society, Clark said, and he's ""certain"" that the majority of citizens would agree that probation is the ""fair thing to do.""

But prosecutor W. Shane Cohen said all his team heard from Clark was, ""We did a favor for society, so she should be let go.""

Cohen said the gun was kept in the couple's bedroom, not near the door where Michael Vincent was shot. All Cynthia Vincent had to do was walk away, Cohen said, but she instead approached her husband from behind with a loaded weapon.

""She put herself in this situation,"" Cohen said. ""She came out and she shot him at the door, within inches of him leaving.""

During statements from family members, Rodney Wright said Michael Vincent, his cousin, was a father figure to him.

""The only justice I see is prison,"" he said. ""I don't understand (why Cynthia Vincent shot him), and I'm never going to understand now.""

William Vincent, Michael Vincent's son, said he ""can't comprehend"" how this happened. His father was loved by the community, he said, evidenced by the 100-plus people who attended a candlelight vigil held shortly after his death.

""I looked up to him,"" William Vincent said. ""He was my protector.""

William Vincent's wife, Lyndsey, said Michael Vincent will never get to see his two grandchildren grow up. Their family misses his laughter, his phone calls, his funny stories and his terrible singing and dancing, she said.

""You will never be forgiven,"" she told Cynthia Vincent. ""You will always have blood on your hands.""

The 30-year-old defendant entered his plea through his lawyer to eight criminal counts, including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, before U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan federal court.

Kaplan set an Oct. 2 trial date. A federal prosecutor, Danielle Sassoon, estimated that a trial could take four weeks, and said the government will soon turn over hundreds of thousands of documents of evidence to defense lawyers.

Bankman-Fried is accused of looting billions of dollars in FTX customer deposits to support his Alameda Research hedge fund, buy real estate and make millions of dollars in political contributions.

It is common for criminal defendants to initially plead not guilty. They may change their pleas later.

Bankman-Fried, now clean-shaven, sported a blue suit, white shirt and dotted blue tie and carried a backpack into the courthouse.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate could face up to 115 years in prison if convicted.

Bankman-Fried rode a boom in the value of bitcoin and other digital assets to build a net worth of an estimated $26 billion and become an influential political donor in the United States.

But FTX collapsed in early November after a wave of withdrawals and declared bankruptcy on Nov. 11, wiping out Bankman-Fried’s fortune. He later said he had $100,000 in his bank account.

PARENTS RECEIVE THREATS

Bankman-Fried was extradited last month from the Bahamas, where he lived and where the exchange was based.

Since his release on a $250 million bond on Dec. 22, Bankman-Fried has been subject to electronic monitoring and required to live with his parents, Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, both professors at Stanford Law School in California.

Kaplan granted Bankman-Fried’s request not to publicize the names of two additional co-signers for the bond.

Lawyers for Bankman-Fried have said his parents, who co-signed the bond, have been receiving physical threats since FTX’s collapse, and that other co-signers might face similar harassment unless their names were kept secret.

The judge also imposed a new bail condition, saying Bankman-Fried cannot access FTX or Alameda assets.

Prosecutors’ case was strengthened by last month’s guilty pleas of two of Bankman-Fried’s closest associates.

Caroline Ellison, who was Alameda’s chief executive, and Gary Wang, FTX’s former chief technology officer, pleaded guilty to seven and four criminal charges, respectively, and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.

Bankman-Fried, Ellison and Wang were also sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Ellison and Wang settled those civil cases.

FTX’s new chief executive, John Ray, known for his work on energy company Enron Corp’s bankruptcy, has said FTX was run by “grossly inexperienced” and unsophisticated people.

A heart transplant recipient, recovery is her top focus and with the help of her husband George − who has been by her side every step of the way throughout her 18-year journey with heart failure − she sees incremental improvement each day.

Her determination is propelling her strong recovery, her doctors say. Still, through that laser-like focus, there are moments when she and George feel the full weight of the last few months.

And in those moments, they exude transcendent gratitude.

""We still look at each other once in awhile in the middle of watching a movie or doing normal activities and say 'Wow, this is surreal,'"" George Cecere said. ""She actually has a new heart beating in her chest.""

Expansion: Christ Hospital adds heart transplant program

'I can't believe you're standing here.'

Terri and George Cecere after Terri received the first heart transplant through the Christ Hospital Health Network's new heart transplant that launched in October.

Cecere received Christ's first heart transplant under a program launched by the hospital in October.

Dr. Geetha Bhat and Dr. Robert Dowling, two nationally-recognized heart transplant specialists who together have performed thousands of open heart procedures, were recruited to lead the program.

A heart transplant program at Christ had been talked about for years. Locally, the University of Cincinnati Medical Center also provides adult heart transplants while Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center performs the procedure for pediatric patients.

Christ's program came along at the right time for Cecere.

Cecere, who battled non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as a teenager, was first diagnosed with heart failure in 2003. She developed a bad cough and she would often wake up in the middle of the night gasping for breath. Though she now lives nearly 50 miles from Cincinnati in Centerville, at the time she was living further away in Lexington, Ky., and was receiving treatment there.

She relapsed after two years of treatment and after consulting with her family, decided to seek out some help from a heart failure specialist. She connected with Dr. Lynne Wagoner, who previously led the University of Cincinnati's heart failure and transplant program, and Dr. Tom O'Brien, who was completing a fellowship under Dr. Wagoner at the time. When Wagoner left for another hospital, Cecere stuck with O'Brien and he continued heart failure consultation with her over the next 16 years.

O'Brien arrived at Christ Hospital in 2009 and Cecere, despite moving to a number of different cities outside of Ohio, continued to seek care from the cardiologist. When O'Brien noticed Cecere's heart functions continued to decline over the past year, eventually reaching severe levels over the summer, he started to go over her options with her. Those conversations continued into the fall.

O'Brien didn't sugarcoat how serious her heart failure had become.

""I asked if I have to have a transplant, where would I go for that, because I knew at that time Christ wasn't doing transplants,"" Cecere recalled. ""(O'Brien) said, 'Well you can go here, here, or here,' or he said 'Actually we have applied for approval to start doing transplants and we hope to know by the end of October. They knew by the end of that week that they had been approved.""

After some testing qualified Cecere for a transplant, she continued with O'Brien's consultation and met with other members of Christ's team.

Cecere was officially listed on the United Network for Organ Sharing heart transplant list on Nov. 1. Three days later, a match was found for her procedure.

""(Terri) has been on the cusp of things new as they've evolved in the treatment for heart failure,"" O'Brien said. ""And it's just worked out that way, blessed I would call it. ...It goes to her credit for being so positive and trusting. I think it goes a long way for someone to have such an optimistic view of life that really helps them through this journey because it's not an easy one. And she and George both have been tremendous facing it head on, looking for success.""

After a successful surgery, Cecere was discharged from the hospital on Dec. 2 to cheers from staff members at Christ. She continues to recover at home.

More heart transplant options help the region, director says

Before coming to Cincinnati, Bhat, the director of Christ's program, and Dowling, the surgical director of the new program, worked together at Jewish Hospital at the University of Louisville and Penn State Health's Milton Hershey Medical Center.

""This is our third journey together,"" Bhat, who completed her training at the University of Cincinnati, said. ""Between the two of us, we have more than 50 years of experience in heart transplantation. (Dowling) from a surgical standpoint and me from a medical standpoint.""

When Dowling received a call about potentially coming to Cincinnati, he said he looked up the numbers and found a gap locally for heart failure care.

""I actually did the homework, I looked at every city east of the Mississippi of similar population and every one has at least two heart transplant programs, if not three in that area,"" Dowling said.

The new program anticipates performing at least 10 transplants in the first year depending on a number of factors. The amount of transplants will increase once the hospital receives Medicare approval for the procedure. In the short and long term, Bhat says the addition of the program will improve the quality of life in the region.

""It's an exciting time for both Christ Hospital as well as the community in Cincinnati because we want to do something that potentially improves the survival as well as the quality of life for patients of heart failure,"" Bhat said.

Cecere becomes emotional when thinking about the selfless act a donor made to give her a new life. She said her recovery is going well and she feels a little stronger each day, able to gradually do more over time. And when she wants to reflect on her journey, she places her hand on her chest to feel the heartbeat. That simple beat means everything to her.

""It's been a long time since I could do that,"" she said.

TOLEDO, Ohio — You've probably noticed the eyebrow-raising billboards around the Toledo area -- The ones that provocatively ask ""Paying for sex?""

Officials at the Toledo-Lucas County Health Department credit to the billboard campaign with helping combat the spread of a serious sexually transmitted illness in our community.

The health department launched the campaign last summer after data showed that 18 percent of syphilis cases in Lucas County were among people who told health officials they were paying for sex.

Syphilis can cause sores and rashes, along with more serious symptoms including fever, headaches, weight loss, fatigue and even blindness, hearing loss and changes to mental state in serious cases.

Syphilis is spread by direct contact with a syphilis sore during sex. It can be prevented by correctly using condoms. The disease is treated with antibiotics, though it is important to treat the disease early to avoid damaging effects, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Lucas County is not alone in seeing a need to combat rising syphilis case numbers. Earlier this year state health officials said the number of syphilis cases detected in Ohio jumped 82 percent between 2016 and 2021. The disease has infected thousands statewide and led to at least 48 congenital cases, in which an infected mother passes syphilis to her unborn child, of the disease in 2021.

The health department's straightforward billboards ask ""Paying for sex? Get tested!"" and includes information on how to schedule an appointment for testing with the health department.

Health department officials said that since the billboards went up, appointments have increased 40-50 percent. The syphilis case rate also has dropped, they said. Compared to this time a year ago, syphilis cases in the region have dropped 12.5 percent, the health department said.

Along with the billboards, the health department's campaign has included advertisements on social media and dating apps. And the department has distributed more than 100,000 condoms, officials said.

The billboard campaign will continue through January, they said.

https://techstory.in/amazon-and-starbucks-employees-have-filed-for-a-union-election/,Amazon and Starbucks employees have filed for a union election – TechStory,"Employees at a Times Square location that combines an Amazon and Starbucks store have petitioned for a union election. Workers claimed that they were obliged to do the duties of two jobs for the salary of one.

The Starbucks-Amazon combination store is the second of its kind, and this petition is the first one to be submitted there. In upper Midtown Manhattan, the two businesses launched their first joint venture in late 2021.

Additionally, each company is dealing with unprecedented strikes. Seven of the more than 250 Starbucks stores are in New York City, which has a unionized workforce.

Attempts to unionize Amazon warehouses have also been made, although just one in Staten Island has been successful to date.

A representative for Starbucks Workers United confirmed that the union has been successful in organizing seven other outlets in downtown Manhattan.

There is a lot of staff turnover at the Times Square site. Several employees claim they were transferred there without consent from other Starbucks locations.

There are no cashiers since the stores use Amazon Go’s renowned “Just Walk Out” technology. Instead, customers select what they want, scan their phones, and then leave.

Starbucks counter is available for mobile pickup

The Starbucks counter is exclusively available for mobile pickup. Customers can sit in a lounge area with seating to eat or work. It attracts a lot of clients due to its handy placement on the ground floor of the New York Times building.

Employees claim they are expected to do the duties of both an Amazon Go employee and a Starbucks employee—but only for the payment of one.

A worker said, “We’re unionizing at this Starbucks because we are doing Amazon work for Starbucks pay. We are not given the proper resources to manage a store of this type in such a high volume area.”

Starbucks and Amazon protested together

On Labor Day, union activists from Starbucks and Amazon protested together to demand recognition from their companies.

https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/11/05/mzuf-n05.html,"Campaigning in Iowa, Trump calls on supporters to become “poll watchers” and “challengers”","In his first campaign-style rally since the near-fatal attack on Paul Pelosi, husband of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, former US president Donald Trump accused the Democrats of cheating in the midterm elections and called on his right-wing supporters to become “poll challengers and poll watchers.”



Speaking Thursday night in Sioux City, Iowa, Trump did not back down from his usual violent rhetoric. He began his speech by telling the few thousand people in attendance, “We are going to end crazy Nancy Pelosi’s political career once and for all.”



Neither Trump nor any of the other Republicans who spoke at the rally denounced the attack on Paul Pelosi, carried out by a fascistic Trump supporter who was targeting the House speaker. Either they ignored it or attempted to place the blame, by implication, on the Biden administration and the Democrats, calling it just another example of a crime wave caused by the supposed invasion of criminal aliens across the “open” southern border.

It was also Trump’s first speech since Biden’s nationally televised address on Wednesday denouncing Trump and MAGA Republicans for inciting violence and refusing to accept defeat at the polls.

Seeking to sow chaos and doubt before the midterm elections on November 8, Trump rehashed the same incitements and lies he has has been telling since the 2016 campaign. He claimed that his opponents were not just wrong, but “sick, corrupt” and “evil.” Trump claimed, without evidence, that mail-in ballots were inherently unreliable and susceptible to fraud.



Instead of voting early, Trump called on his supporters to “swamp” the polling stations on Election Day. “We need a landslide so big that the radical left cannot rig it or steal it,” he hissed.



“If you care about election integrity, volunteer as an election worker, poll watcher, or poll challenger. We need you,” he added.

“Election integrity” is a euphemism Trump and his right-wing supporters use to describe as fraudulent any vote not cast for Trump or his “Make America Great Again” loyalists.



Trump’s call for his supporters to show up in person at polling stations has been repeated on the far-right War Room podcast, hosted by former Trump special adviser Stephen Bannon.



The moves by Trump and the Republicans to disrupt the vote and intimidate likely Democratic voters prompted the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the US Capitol Police and the National Counter-Terrorism Center to release a joint alert last week warning that domestic extremists “pose a heightened threat to the 2022 midterm elections” and that election workers and officials are “attractive” targets.



Last month, the Department of Justice (DoJ) announced charges against Iowa resident Mark Rissi, 64. Rissi was arrested for sending threatening messages to an election official in Maricopa County, Arizona. According to the DoJ press release, one of the threatening voicemails was for Clint Hickman, a member of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors.



“When we come to lynch your stupid lying Commie [expletive], you’ll remember that you lied on the [expletive] Bible, you piece of sh*t,” Rissi said, according to the DoJ. “You’re gonna die, you piece of sh*t. We’re going to hang you. We’re going to hang you.”



The embrace of Trump’s election lies by virtually the entire Republican Party, and the normalization of political violence, were most sharply expressed at Thursday’s rally in comments made by Georgia representative and QAnon fascist Marjorie Taylor Greene, a regular at Trump’s rallies.

In her speech, Greene goaded the crowd into booing Paul Pelosi, who was only released from San Francisco General Hospital on Thursday. After blaming Democrats for the “highest crime in decades,” Greene complained that the “only crime victim you hear about from Democrats in the media is Paul Pelosi.”

“Paul Pelosi was brutally attacked by a drugged-out illegal alien that should have been deported,” said Greene.



Hailing Trump as the Republican Party’s “one true leader,” Greene ended her speech by calling for a purge of all Republican officials who balk at declaring unconditional fealty to the would-be Führer.

“We can no longer be the party of Mitch McConnell, John McCain, Dick Cheney, George Bush and Mitt Romney... or any other sellout weak Republican,” she said.



Giving the lie to Biden’s claim in his address on Wednesday that MAGA Republicans comprise only a small part of the Republican Party, Trump and Greene were joined at Thursday’s rally by the longest-serving member of the US Senate, Iowa’s Chuck Grassley.



The 89-year-old senator is up for re-election and is currently leading his Democratic opponent, Michael Franken, a retired three-star Navy admiral, by roughly three percentage points, according to the latest polling.



In his comments, Grassley thanked Trump for coming to Iowa and attacked Biden, who has bent over backwards to appease his “Republican colleagues,” for being “divisive,” i.e., raising the attempted coup of January 6 and warning of the ongoing conspiracy headed by Trump to establish a fascistic dictatorship.



Speaking to Trump, Grassley said, “You kept your word,” while, “Biden, who said he was going to unite America, has done everything to divide America.”



In her remarks at the rally, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds mimicked Trump’s attacks on immigrants while boasting that as governor she “banned mask and vaccine mandates.”



Showing no concern for the over 10,000 Iowans who have succumbed needlessly to the coronavirus, Reynolds boasted, “We stayed open and got our kids back into the classroom!”



The Republican candidate for Iowa attorney general, Brenna Bird, received Trump’s “complete and total endorsement” Thursday after she declared her support for Trump’s “stolen election” lie. Bird began her speech by attacking her Democratic opponent, Tom Miller, for not supporting “voter ID or election integrity.”

Biden and the Democrats’ impotent calls for the population to vote to “defend democracy” are completely hollow. According to CNBC, US billionaires have spent $880 million this election cycle buying their preferred candidates and policies in both parties. The figure, already 44 percent more than in 2018, according to Americans for Tax Fairness, is expected to exceed $1 billion sometime next week.

Any attempts by workers to combat the attacks on the their living standards by striking for better wages, health care and working conditions are virtually outlawed, as seen in the struggles of rail, dock and airline workers in the US.



Meanwhile, Trump and allies like Marjorie Taylor Greene are increasingly seeking to whip up anti-Semitism in line with their efforts to mobilize far-right forces. Trump now concludes every rally with piped-in music associated with the QAnon narrative of the “storm” that will sweep away the “globalists,” which is understood in those circles as a reference to Jews.

Prior to Trump’s rally on Thursday, the FBI office in Newark, New Jersey issued an unprecedented warning saying that the agency had received “credible information” of a “broad threat” to synagogues throughout the state of New Jersey.



“We ask at this time that you take all security precautions to protect your community and facility,” a tweet from the agency read.



On Friday morning, the FBI released another tweet saying that the agency had located the “source of the threat.” In a conference call with 500 Jewish leaders and New Jersey Governor Philip Murphy, FBI special agent James Dennehy revealed that the FBI had identified and questioned “for hours” a man with “radical extremist views” who was the source of the threats.



“He expressed radical, extremist views and ideology, as well as an extreme amount of hate against the Jewish community,” Dennehy said, according to a report in the New York Times. As of his writing, no other information has been released, including if the man has been arrested or charged.

Ruben Roman, 23, stood trial this week before Judge Charles Burns on three felony counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon and one felony count of recklessly discharging a firearm. The charges were not directly related to the death of Toledo, whose killing by Officer Eric Stillman roiled the city and spurred calls for reform to the Chicago Police Department’s foot pursuit policies. Instead, the charges stemmed from Roman’s alleged actions while he was with Toledo just before the shooting.

Burns delivered a lengthy explanation before reading his verdict, stating that the case was not about whether the shooting of Toledo was justified, or whether Roman should have been out on the streets with Toledo at 2:30 a.m.

“That is not my duty here when addressing these matters,” Burns said from the bench at the Leighton Criminal Court Building.

Rather, he said his role was to determine whether the state proved Roman fired a weapon prior to Toledo’s shooting — a case that both prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed was circumstantial. Though Burns said prosecutors made logical inferences based on available evidence and noted that circumstantial evidence is considered evidence, he did not find that it was enough to meet their burden of proof.

“I do not believe Mr. Roman is innocent. There is a difference between calling somebody innocent and saying not guilty,” Burns said as he acquitted Roman. “The state has failed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.”

Prosecutors argued that Roman was captured on video firing a weapon at a passing car while standing with Toledo in the 2400 block of South Sawyer Avenue in Little Village in the early morning hours on March 29, 2021. They also said gloves he dropped tested positive for gunshot residue.

Chicago police officers detain Ruben Roman on March 29, 2021, who was identified by Cook County prosecutors as the man who fired the shots that attracted police to the area in the moments before Adam Toledo was shot.

Roman’s defense attorneys, though, countered that no witnesses or forensic evidence definitively tie Roman to the weapon. They argued Toledo could have been the person who fired the gun, which they said creates reasonable doubt.

“Even in light of all of this evidence, it is not enough to show Ruben Roman actually possessed or fired a weapon,” said Karin Talwar, Roman’s attorney, during closing arguments on Thursday. “There is evidence of a possible other theory.”

Some of what was presented during the trial could point to different scenarios, the judge said. The gun was found near Toledo, not Roman. It’s possible the gun could have passed between the two while they ran from police, but no proof of that was presented, he noted. Gunshot residue can be present because someone fired a weapon, witnesses testified, but it can also find its way onto clothes if someone is in the presence of gunfire. Casings collected from the area of 24th and Sawyer matched the gun found near Toledo, but there’s no way to say when the bullets were fired, or who fired them.

When it came down to it, Burns said, the case “turns on video.”

Defense attorneys had argued that it was not possible to discern facial features or physical characteristics from the surveillance videos, but prosecutors maintained that Roman and Toledo could be distinguished based on the clothes they wore that night.

Prosecutors said surveillance video showed that while Toledo and Roman stood on a corner, Roman stepped forward to fire as a car passed while Toledo moved backward. But ultimately Burns said one could not even definitively say that what happened in the video was a shooting, with no audio or visual signifiers like a muzzle flash or a clear picture of the gun.

“I do not feel, at this point in time, the evidence presented … while compelling I admit, is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt,” he said.

Earlier in the trial, Stillman’s partner Corina Gallegos testified that the two were called to 24th and Sawyer because gunfire triggered a ShotSpotter detection. The officers didn’t see anyone at the corner when they arrived, Gallegos said, but saw Roman and Toledo later when they drove into an alley.

The officers started chasing Roman and Toledo, Gallegos said. Stillman pushed Roman to the ground and continued after Toledo. Gallegos stayed behind and handcuffed Roman, when she heard a gunshot.

Gallegos testified that she went to her partner and saw officers giving chest compressions to Toledo.

After the shooting, video released by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, which investigates police shootings, showed Toledo tossing a gun behind a fence before he was fatally shot by Stillman. Gallegos testified she later found the gun on the other side of the fence.

Mourners gather at the scene, on April 21, 2021, for a blessing ceremony for 13-year-old Adam Toledo who was fatally shot by police in March 2021 during a foot pursuit.

After tossing the gun, Toledo turned toward the officer raising his hands, according to the video. When announcing her office would not charge Stillman, Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx said the actions happened “almost simultaneously.”

Roman was not immediately released after his acquittal, due to a pending probation violation in a 2019 case. A court date is scheduled for Monday.

A spokesperson for the Cook County state’s attorney’s office said in a statement that the case was prosecuted to the “fullest extent.”

The office “will continue prosecuting cases based on the law and the evidence as we strive to increase safety in our communities across Cook County,” the statement said.

The Police Department’s policy on foot pursuits came under scrutiny after the shooting of Toledo and others, including from the independent monitor reviewing CPD’s progress in complying with a sweeping consent decree that orders reforms.

The department released its final, revised foot pursuit policy earlier this year.

https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/360879,Judge delays trial between Twitter and Elon Musk,"A judge on Thursday delayed a looming trial between Twitter and Elon Musk, giving Musk more time to close his $44 billion deal to buy the company after months spent fighting to get out of it, The Associated Press reported.

Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, head of the Delaware Chancery Court, said that Musk has until October 28 to close the deal. A trial set for Oct. 17 will happen in November if he does not, she said.

The ruling came hours after Twitter asked the Delaware court to proceed with the trial against Musk, saying the billionaire refuses to accept the ""contractual obligations"" of his April agreement to buy the social media company for $44 billion.

Musk announced in July that he was backing out of the deal to purchase Twitter, agreed upon in April, after alleging the firm failed to provide enough information on fake account numbers.

Twitter fired back at Musk and said his bid to terminate the acquisition of the social media company is “invalid and wrongful.”

A day later, the social media company sued Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery to force him to go through with the deal.

However, earlier this week Musk reversed course and again proposed to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share.

Twitter’s attorneys sent a letter on Thursday to the Delaware Chancery Court’s head judge, not long after Musk’s legal team asked her to call off the trial while he works on a renewed bid to buy the company.

Twitter disputed Musk’s claim that the San Francisco-based company is refusing to accept the new bid.

Musk’s attorneys said earlier on Thursday that the trial should be adjourned to leave more time for Musk to secure the financing.

""Twitter will not take yes for an answer,"" said the court filing signed by Musk attorney Edward Micheletti. ""Astonishingly, they have insisted on proceeding with this litigation, recklessly putting the deal at risk and gambling with their stockholders’ interests.""",Q4

A 27-year-old Russian rapper took his own life to avoid being drafted to fight in President Vladimir Putin's brutal war in Ukraine after tragically declaring he was ""not ready to kill for any ideals."" Ivan Vitalievich Petunin, who performed under the stage name 'walkie', was found dead on Friday after jumping from a high-rise apartment building in the city of Krasnodar, according to Russian-language news outlet 93.ru, which was translated by The Post, reports nypost.com.

The rapper's death has since been confirmed by his girlfriend and his mother, who spoke to a 93.ru reporter, independent Russian media outlet Mediazona reported.

Petunin died by suicide by throwing himself off the 10th floor, local sources told the outlets.

Before the tragic leap, the rapper also filmed himself delivering a heart-wrenching suicide message that was posted to his Telegram channel, local media reported.

""If you are watching this video, then I am no longer alive,"" he said in Russian, according to a translated version of the 2-minute 16-second clip published by TMZ.

""I can't take the sin of murder on my soul and I don't want to. I am not ready to kill for any ideals. To murder someone in war or otherwise is something I cannot do,"" he continued.

""It seems to me that partial mobilisation will become full in a few days,"" Petunin said, referencing the ramped-up war effort rolled out by strongman Putin, whom he later called a ""maniac.""

""Forgive me, my loved ones, but sometimes you have to die for your principles,"" the tragic message continued.

""My last decision is exactly how I die,"" he continued, looking emotional and breathing deeply.

Walkie had nearly 40,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, and his song which means ""Neurotoxin,"" had been streamed nearly 2 million times.

The recording artist had been releasing music since 2013, his Bandcamp page showed.

Petunin had reportedly previously served in the army and had been treated in a mental hospital.

In a letter to his girlfriend, Petunin wrote that because of Russia's sham 'referendums' that led to the annexation of four regions of Ukraine last week, ""everyone will go to the front lines.""

He continued: ""People with psychosocial ailments ever worse than mine are already being sent there without any hesitation.""

His final act of desperation came as Russian men were fleeing the warring nation in droves or breaking their own arms to avoid being conscripted into military action following Putin's September 21 address that called for 300,000 reservists to be sent to battle.

Nearly 200,000 Russians had fled to neighbouring Georgia, Kazakhstan and Finland since the announcement, risking 10-year prison sentences if captured.

But for Google, it seems the pace has been speeded up. Today, we learned that the Indian government fined $160 million to Google for an Android-related monopoly in the country. A day ago, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced a new lawsuit against Google.

He is accusing Google of breaking the state’s biometric data law. It turns out Google had no consent for collecting and using facial and voice information from millions of Texas consumers.

The States Are Filing Lawsuits Against Google One By One

There is no federal privacy law. So the states have to fight against the misuse of user data on their own. Last year, Illinois filed a lawsuit against Facebook under its Biometric Information Privacy Act. As a result, Facebook paid $650 million.

Further reading: Google Is Collecting Private Medical Records Without Patient Consent

Earlier this year, both companies were accused of collecting biometric information from users without their informed consent. The author of the charge was the Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act. Paxton. The latter said that Google had been collecting and storing facial and voice information at least since 2015. The tech giant has been using several services, including Google Photos, Google Assistant, and Nest smart-home products. Of course, it didn’t obtain adequate consent. In fact, Google uses the information to improve its artificial intelligence algorithms.

“AG Paxton is once again mischaracterizing our products in another breathless lawsuit,” Google spokesperson José Castañeda said in a statement. “For example, Google Photos helps you organize pictures of people, by grouping similar faces, so you can easily find old photos. Of course, this is only visible to you and you can easily turn off this feature if you choose and we do not use photos or videos in Google Photos for advertising purposes. The same is true for Voice Match and Face Match on Nest Hub Max, which are off-by-default features that give users the option to let Google Assistant recognize their voice or face to show their information. We will set the record straight in court.”

A 28-year-old from Nikiski was arrested this weekend after Alaska State Troopers said he drove into the front of Outlaw Body & Paint on Kalifornsky Beach Road and then fled the scene.

Troopers were notified around 6:30 p.m. Saturday that a car had collided into the front of the business, causing “a large amount of damage.”

Jackson wrote that the car had destroyed the front door as well as the windows and asked the community to keep an eye out for the vehicle.

Troopers found the vehicle in Homer, according to the dispatch. They arrested Joseph Newton, of Nikiski, on charges of driving under the influence, third-degree criminal mischief, leaving the scene of a property damage accident and violating conditions of release.

https://comicbook.com/movies/news/netflix-the-pale-blue-eye-movie-poster-christian-bale-edgar-allan-poe/,The Pale Blue Eye Starring Christian Bale Official Poster Released by Netflix,"Before there was Edgar Allan Poe’s genius detective C. Auguste Dupin, there was Detective Augustus Landor. Netflix has revealed the first poster for its gothic murder mystery The Pale Blue Eye, described by the streamer as “a gripping whodunit that’s also an Edgar Allan Poe origin story.” Starring The Dark Knight and Thor: Love and Thunder‘s Christian Bale as the veteran detective at the heart of the fictional mystery, The Pale Blue Eye re-teams Bale with his Out of the Furnace and Hostiles filmmaker Scott Cooper. See the poster below.

Videos by ComicBook.com

The poster comes after Netflix dropped The Pale Blue Eye trailer, touting a cast that includes Harry Melling (Harry Potter), Gillian Anderson (The X-Files), Lucy Boynton (Bohemian Rhapsody), and Robert Duvall (The Godfather).

Based on Louis Bayard’s 2006 novel, The Pale Blue Eye follows aseasoned detective named Augustus Landor (Bale), called in tohunt a deadly killer on the grounds of the United States MilitaryAcademy at West Point. A cadet is dead, his heart cruelly ripped fromhis chest, and the school is desperate for answers. But when Landor’sinvestigation runs afoul of West Point’s code of silence, he becomesentangled with the fate of an insubordinate young cadet: a young poetnamed Edgar Allan Poe (Harry Melling).

The title is inspired by Poe’s classic short story The Tell-Tale Heart, where Poe writes: “Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees — very gradually — I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.”



“Because my father taught English and there was lots of literaturestrewn about our house, Poe came into my world at a young age, and I wasjust fascinated with his works,” Cooper told Netflix’s Tudum. “And my father,after I directed Crazy Heart, he said, ‘There’s a novel that you should read; it’s The Pale Blue Eye and it has Edgar Allan Poe as a character at the center of an investigation.’”



The fictional murder mystery involving the literary icon “allowed me to do three things,” Cooper said: “Make a film that’s a whodunit; [tell]a father-and-son love story — a kinship between two men who are loners,who live on the margins of society; and then of course, this couldserve as a Poe origin story.”



The Pale Blue Eye is in select theaters December 23rd and streaming on Netflix January 6th.

https://www.butlereagle.com/20221221/kellys-effort-to-rename-post-office-clears-major-hurdle-2/,Kelly’s effort to rename post office clears major hurdle,"Only one more action stands between U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly and his effort to have the Butler Post Office on Main Street renamed for a local Civil War captain and avid public servant.

Kelly announced on Tuesday that the U.S. Senate voted unanimously to approve renaming the post office after Captain Andrew Gomer Williams.

The House passed the bill on Dec. 12.

The bill now must be signed by President Joe Biden, which Kelly fully expects the president to do.

“I want to thank my colleagues in the U.S. Senate for supporting this bill,” Kelly said in a news release. “Andrew Gomer Williams lived a life of service to his community and country, and I am proud to cement his legacy in our nation’s history.”

Although Williams was born in Richmond, Va., in 1846, he fought for the Union during the Civil War.

He enlisted in the Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, Company E, 63rd Regiment, in September 1861 in Pittsburgh for a three-year stint.

Williams was promoted from sergeant to lieutenant one year later and was wounded at Fredericksburg and again during the Rapidan Campaign, when he was shot in the left temple with a musket ball.

He returned to service and was promoted in 1863 to the rank of captain at Gettysburg.

During his service, Williams bravely led his company in more than a dozen battles. He was wounded a total of four times during the war.

Williams was discharged in August 1864 and mustered out as one of only three officers in his unit who survived the bloody war between the North and South.

In his history, listed on the state Senate website, Williams is named as a tradesman, nailmaker, bookkeeper, attorney and notary public.

After the war, Williams returned home to Pittsburgh to study law while working in the city’s factories to support his family.

He moved to Butler in 1875 and opened a law firm after earning his law degree.

According to a 1923 Butler Eagle article, Williams and his wife, Emma, lived at the home they built at 440 N. McKean Street.

In 1891, Williams, a bespectacled gentleman with a full head of hair and impressive long beard, was elected as a Republican state representative. He served a two-year term in Harrisburg.

In 1900, the Republican was elected to serve in the state Senate. Williams served his constituents in Butler and Armstrong counties until 1904.

Williams spent 20 years as choir director at First Methodist Church in Butler, assisted veterans’ spouses in receiving their Civil War widow’s pension, was a Mason and volunteered on the Board of Directors for the Civil War Orphans Home in Butler.

Williams died in 1923 at the age of 72.

Chad Slater, a Gulf War veteran of the Navy, Air Force and Reserves, has been a Civil War re-enactor for 30 years.

He re-enacted in Williams’ regiment for 20 of those years.

When Slater read the book “Under the Red Patch,” which was written by a Civil War survivor who served in the 63rd, he learned that Williams was buried in North Cemetery in Butler.

Slater found Williams’ small headstone, which did not list his military or political service.

So Slater approached the Veterans of Foreign Wars post 249 in Butler about getting a new headstone for Williams due to his military and community service.

Because post 249 is responsible for marking veterans’ graves in North Cemetery, they paid for a brand new headstone for Williams, which was dedicated in 2020.

“They said it was their honor to take care of it,” Slater said of the VFW post’s funding of the headstone.

It was at the headstone dedication that Kelly told Slater he wished he could do more than just hand Williams’ great-granddaughter, Caroline Hunt, a folded flag.

Kelly then came up with the idea to rename the Butler Post Office after the Civil War Captain from Butler.

Asked why he feels Williams deserves to have his name on the post office, Slater replies that after being shot in the head at the Battle of the Wilderness outside Fredericksburg, Williams wandered into Spottsylvania days later to rejoin his regiment.

Slater also points to Williams’ service to the Butler community after his discharge from the Army.

“He’s a true American hero in my eyes,” Slater said.

He is thrilled that Kelly’s bill passed both chambers and is now headed to Biden’s desk.

“Me being a veteran, I couldn’t think of a more fitting way to honor this man, especially since he was in the regiment I reenacted,” Slater said. “This will shine a perpetual light on him.”

Mary Caroline Hunt of Pittsburgh is the great granddaughter of Williams, who was her mother’s grandfather.

Her mother frequently talked about Williams, Hunt said, and said the indentation on his head from the musketball that struck him remained visible all his life.

She said her mother described Williams as tall and distinguished, and very punctual.

“She said you could set your watch by the time he closed the door each day at his law office,” Hunt recalled.

Hunt’s mother spent many happy summers at her grandparents’ North McKean Street home.

Hunt is very proud that her great grandfather, whom her mother loved dearly, will be honored all these generations after his brave service in the Civil War.

“He was doing his duty and loving his country,” Hunt said of Williams’ military service. “It’s a really distinguished heritage.”

Kelly is thrilled the bill has been successful.

“This is a great honor for a man who selflessly served his community and his country,” he said.",Q4

Still, Harris pushed an optimistic message that highlighted the national party's slogan of ""Democrats deliver"" and urged Texas Democrats at their annual ""JJ Reception in Austin"" to embrace Biden administration successes on a range of legislative issues ranging from a deal aimed at lowering prescription drugs prices, spending on infrastructure renewal projects and to COVID relief.

""Democrats stood on the floor and delivered relief to the American people,"" Harris told attendees at the JJ Reception, named for the late President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. ""People are suffering.""

The first woman ever elected on a national ticket also used her two stops in Austin to champion efforts to restore the reproductive freedoms that were struck down when the Supreme Court on June 24 overturned the 1973 landmark case, Roe v. Wade that had affirmed the right to abortion.

Before the reception, Harris appeared at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library on the University of Texas campus, where she affirmed her support for abortion rights and likened the effort to restore them the civil rights struggle of the 1960s that helped define the 36th president's administration.

She said the recent high court ruling that struck down the constitutional right of a woman to terminate a pregnancy ""has profound ramifications.""

""At its core, this is about freedom, liberty,"" Harris said during a question-and-answer session. ""And on every level."" She reminded the 200-plus invited guests inside the library's 10-floor Atrium Room that the midterm elections are one month away and that ""it matters"" who gets elected up and down the ballot.

She also cast the abortion issue in generational terms after the Supreme Court's ruling striking down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision of 1973.

""We have a 23-year-old daughter and I have an 83-year-old mother-in-law,"" she said. ""Our daughters will have fewer rights than my mother-in-law did.""

At the reception, Harris denounced Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's support for the Texas law that now forbids abortion with no exception for rape or incest as ""radical"" and stated that Texas must ""elect Beto O'Rourke as governor."" However, the Democratic nominee and former congressman from El Paso did not attend either function in Austin.

A spokesman said O'Rourke was sticking to his long-planned ""weekend of blockwalking"" campaign schedule.

Abbott's campaign derided the vice president's Texas visit, saying her agenda in the state was misguided.

""Instead of coming to Texas to fundraise for border crisis-denier Beto O’ Rourke, the vice president should take time to visit the border to see first hand the complete disaster she and the president created,"" said Abbott spokesman Mark Miner.

Abbott, seeking a third term as governor, has made illegal immigration a central theme of his re-election effort. Harris was tasked early on as the Biden administration's point person on immigration, specifically as the Associated Press reported at the time, ""to oversee diplomatic efforts to deal with issues spurring migration in the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, as well as pressing them to strengthen enforcement on their own borders.""

The task is also to include finding a ""long-term strategy that gets at the root causes of migration from those countries.""

Harris made little mention of immigration during her Austin visit. But she did reaffirm the administration's commitment to establish a pathway to citizenship for the children of immigrants who came into the United States without legal authorization ""because America is their home.""

Harris in September was in Houston where she chaired the National Space Council and toured a space-vehicle mock-up facility. And last year, she visited El Paso where she toured Border Patrol facilities amid what was then the beginning of a burgeoning crisis in unauthorized immigration.

Harris loudest applause from the Democrats was when she reminded them of Biden's recent action pardoning people who were convicted on simple possession of marijuana on federal cases.

""The bottom line is no one should have to go to jail for smoking weed,"" she said.

In a Dallas County courtroom Monday, lead prosecutor Glen Fitzmartin laid out the case against Chemirmir.

""Over the course of the next few days you're going to hear about a woman named Mary Brooks and how she came to her untimely death at the hands of Billy Chemirmir,"" he said.

87-year-old Mary Brooks was found dead inside her Richardson home on January 31, 2018. Her grandson, David Cuddihee, testified her front door was unlocked, groceries from Walmart sat on the kitchen counter, and she also had no jewelry on.

A safe and other jewelry were missing from the house.

""My nieces pointed out that we hadn't seen any jewelry,"" said Ann Brooks, Mary's daughter.

""Two months later is when things really start to come together that we in Dallas County has an individual whose preying, killing women,"" said Fitzmartin.

Chemirmir was convicted of capital murder in April for the killing of Lu Harris in 2018, but a second capital murder conviction might provide needed assurance to families.

Investigators believe Chemirmir tried to kill yet another woman, Mary Bartel, by smothering her.

She survived and gave detective information that led to Chemirmir. Her 2018 deposition was shown to the jury Monday.

Surveillance video is key evidence in this trial, as it was for the jury in the previous trial.

The video shows Harris and Chemirmir at Walmart at the same time.

Brooks had been shopping there as well.

The prosecution says Chemirmir was parked next to Brooks at the store the day she was killed, Jan. 30, 2018.

Richardson Police Sergeant Kelly Pagel testified Chemirmir's cell phone pinged from the Walmart to Brooks' home, placing him at the scene of the crime.

She also testified that the next day, Chemirmir sold a rare piece of jewelry belonging to Brooks on the site Offer Up.

One former Dallas County prosecutor with no ties to the case told FOX 4: ""The likely purpose of this prosecution is to ensure that a second consecutive life sentence is handed down.

https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/clay-waters/2022/09/30/ny-times-alarmed-gop-spreading-racist-fears-about-soft-crime,NY Times Alarmed By GOP Spreading ‘Racist Fears’ About Soft-on-Crime Democrats,"The crime issue’s potential positive impact on Republican prospects in November is coming into alarmed focus at the New York Times. A prime example: Tuesday’s 1,700-word front-page story by Lisa Lerer and Jonathan Weisman, “G.O.P. Redoubles Efforts to Tie Democrats to High Crime Rates.”

In Pennsylvania, Republicans are attacking John Fetterman, the Democratic Senate candidate, as “dangerously liberal on crime.” Outside Portland, Ore., where years of clashes between left-wing protesters and the police have captured national attention, a Republican campaign ad juxtaposes video of Jamie McLeod-Skinner, a Democratic congressional candidate, protesting with footage of rioters and looters....

If it’s the Times on the GOP and crime, you know that phony accusations of racism will be close behind.

In the final phase of the midterm campaign, Republicans are intensifying their focus on crime and public safety, hoping to shift the debate onto political terrain that many of the party’s strategists and candidates view as favorable. The strategy seeks to capitalize on some voters’ fears about safety -- after a pandemic-fueled crime surge that in some cities has yet to fully recede. But it has swiftly drawn criticism as a return to sometimes deceptive or racially divisive messaging.

While the Times couldn’t wholly ignore the damage done by left-wing calls to “defund the police"" and the Democratic attempt to reverse the trend, the article swiftly changed the subject to alleged Republican racism.

Some of the advertising contains thinly disguised appeals to racist fears, like grainy footage of Black Lives Matter protesters, that sharply contrast with Republican efforts at the beginning of Mr. Trump’s term to highlight the party’s work on criminal justice overhauls, sentencing reductions and the pardoning of some petty crimes.

The Republican beef isn’t with BLM “protesters,” but the rioters who did millions of dollars worth of violence and damage in major American cities in the summer of 2020. And a supposedly racist ""ad"" in the Wisconsin senate race...isn't racist. (It can be viewed at the link in the graph below).

Some of the advertising has racial overtones. An ad against Mr. Barnes from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which highlights the 2021 attack at a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wis., ends with a picture of Mr. Barnes alongside three members of the progressive “Squad” -- all women of color -- and the words “different” and “dangerous.” His supporters called the ad racist.

The Times got nitpicky with Republican accusations against Democrats.

Other ads are slightly misleading: In New York, the first general-election ad from the Republican candidate for governor, Representative Lee Zeldin, is a compilation of grainy footage of shootings, looting and fistfights. “Vote like your life depends on it,” a narrator urges. “It just might.” Mr. Zeldin recently confirmed that half of the video in the ad was shot before Gov. Kathy Hochul took office, and that one clip was from Oakland, Calif.

The article did end with a reluctant admission that the Republican message on crime was getting through.",Q4

October 28, 2022 (San Francisco) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s 82-year-old husband, Paul, was brutally assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at the couple’s San Francisco home early Friday morning.

Police have confirmed that the intruder shouted “Where is Nancy?” not realizing that the Speaker was not in town.

Paul Pelosi managed to dial 911 and kept the line open, allowing a 911 operator to hear the exchange and dispatch police.

Officers arrived in time to witness the elderly Pelosi struggling with the assailant, who bashed Paul Pelosi in the head before police officers wrestled him to the ground.

The suspect, 42-year-old David DePape, has been arrested on charges of attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse and other felony crimes, CNN reports. His social media posts indicate he is a MAGA Republican and Trump supporter who promoted conspiracy theories online about the 2020 election, the January 6, 2021 insurrection at the Capitol, COVID-19 and more.

Speaker Pelosi is next in the line of succession for the presidency, after Vice President Kamala Harris. Nancy Pelosi and the Pelosi’s five children have all flown to San Francisco to be with Paul Pelosi, who underwent five hours of surgery to repair a fractured skull and injuries to his right arm and hand. He is expected to make a full recovery, according to Speaker Pelosi’s office.

Locally, the attack drew bipartisan condemnation from East County’s Congressional representatives.

Democratic Congresswoman Sara Jacobs tweeted, “I’m so thankful that Paul Pelosi is safe and will make a full recovery, but this news is disturbing and unacceptable. No one – including elected officials and their families—should be the victim of violence and harassment.”

Republican Congressman Darrell Issa posted on his Twitter account, “I’m shocked by news of the terrible attack on Paul Pelosi in his own home. Hoping for a swift and full recovery.”",Q4
https://www.q13fox.com/news/why-some-fires-are-left-to-burn-and-what-it-means-for-air-quality,"Wildfire fighting strategy: Why some fires are left to burn, and what it means for air quality","Air quality has improved in Puget Sound, but air quality alerts remain in play as wildfires around the state continue to spew smoke into the air.

At points this weekend, air quality in Seattle ranked among the worst in the world.

""This is the worst it’s ever been for me,"" said Emily Gifford. ‘I’m from Australia, so I went through those fires over there, but I didn’t think it was as bad as it is right now – but we’re really close to these fires too, where we live.""

Smoke has changed the perspective of many who live close to wildfires that have stretched into mid-October this season. However, the concern expanded when that haze and smoke started affecting a larger scale of people this week.

Winds typically blows west to east near Puget Sound, but this week, a wind from the east has spewed smoke from the Bolt Creek Fire into the area. Other fires around the state are contributing as well, but the decision to attack Bolt Creek with a ""consumptive strategy"" – or allowing the fire to burn in interior pockets – has left people facing smoke asking questions.

George Geissler, the Washington State Forester who is in charge of Washington Department of Natural Resources' wildfire strategy, said he’s been hearing questions about why more aircraft haven’t been put on the Bolt Creek Fire – especially after a weekend of haze, and smoke.

""Over the weekend there was so much smoke and so much wind that at times we couldn’t use aircraft effectively so we kept them on the ground,"" said Geissler.

As bad as smoke can be for people to inhale, it can make dropping water on a fire from above dangerous. In other cases, they are calculating which fires are in the greatest need of air support – based on what crews are available, which fires are threatening homes, and what assets are needed for new fires.

As for why the state’s strategy involves allowing parts of the fire to burn – including the Wild Sky Wilderness – there are several factors: terrain, the safety of both firefighters and pilots and it creates a buffer in the area in the case of future wildfire risk.

According to Geissler, they are required to engage the fire on state and private lands – though fire on federal lands have different rules: if a wildfire is burning in an area that meets specific objectives they can treat it like a ‘prescribed burn.’

While the Bolt Creek Fire isn’t the only fire causing smoke, it is drawing the most attention – a major issue right now is that large trees are serving as fuels. Those fuels are burning hot, and aren’t disappearing anytime soon. Add in steep terrain where rocks can overheat, expand then retract – and you get hazards of falling boulders.

At this stage, the fire has burned more than 14,000 acres. Crews have been able to gain 41% containment, though Geissler said a fire that size will require several inches of rain over the course of days.

""We may have it contained, but it would take more water and more personnel than we’d ever have available to use to get it completely out,"" he said. ""That’s where Mother Nature comes into play.""

If there’s a silver lining to the Bolt Creek Fire, it’s that it’s doing good work for the landscape. It’s not eliminating tens of thousands of acres of timber like larger fires, instead, it’s burning the ‘understory.’ Though, it also makes an assault on the fire more difficult.

The current forecast has rain in the outlook, which could be helpful both in terms of smoke and tampering down fires in our area. However, Geissler has also cautioned that he’s not seen anything yet that ensures the fires will be put out, or that the dry conditions won’t return quickly.

It’s a familiar issue for Washington state – wildfire season has become a year of wildfires. Geissler now specifically differentiates the ""season"" within a fire year, noting they’ve started fighting fires as early as March, and had a fire season in recent memory where they battled fires all 12 months.

""Climate change is probably exacerbating that, and we’re seeing more potential for fires, we’ve already been having early starts in our summer fire season, and they’re going much later.""",Q4

DENVER — Both women who were stabbed in an apartment in southeast Denver last week have died of their injuries, the Denver Police Department said.

Police said the stabbing happened Wednesday morning at an apartment building at 10150 East Harvard Avenue. At 7:48 a.m., a woman called 911 to report that the suspect, Matthew Omara, 37, was there in violation of a restraining order, a probable cause statement says.

> The video above aired Wednesday

About 20 minutes later, the woman called 911 again and said Omara was armed with a knife and was making threats. Denver Police officers arrived on scene three minutes later, the statement says.

When officers arrived, they found one victim in a hallway. The woman, 20-year-old Taylor Trevino, died of her injuries, police said.

The other victim was found on the living room floor of an apartment. She was taken to the hospital in critical condition. Police said Tuesday that she has died. On Wednesday, she was identified as 56-year-old Christina Hardin.

Omara is also suspected in an assault at 2570 S. Dayton Way minutes after the stabbing. Around 8:17 a.m., police said, someone called 911 to report that a man was attacking workers outside a building. The man had asked one of the workers whether a van parked in front of the building was his, then punched him in the face and hit him in the head with a rock, police said. Other workers restrained the man until officers arrived, the probable cause statement says.

As of Monday, Omara is charged with one count of first-degree murder, one count of attempted first-degree murder and one count of assault. His next court appearance is set for Thursday.

Since a judge in Pima County judge ruled that Arizona can enforce a near-total ban on abortions, abortion access has become a key issue in the tight race between Republican Kari Lake and Democrat Katie Hobbs to be the state's next governor.

A new CBS News Battleground Tracker poll of likely Arizona voters shows Hobbs and Lake tied at 49% with less than five weeks until Election Day. Six in 10 registered voters in Arizona say abortion should be legal in the state in most cases.

In September, a judge removed a decades-old injunction that blocked enforcement of a law that's been in place since 1901, over a decade before Arizona became a state. That law makes it illegal for anyone to provide an abortion surgically or with drugs and is punishable by two to five years in prison.

The ruling, weeks before the midterm elections on Nov. 8, is energizing Democratic voters and some independent-leaning Republicans in the state, whose support could be crucial particularly in the race.

Former Republican state Sen. Heather Carter said Tuesday that she's switched her party registration to independent because of the ""extreme"" positions her GOP colleagues are taking on many policy issues, including abortion rights.

""I've been registered Republican since I was 18 years-old, but the party has just moved beyond anything I recognize (from) when I first registered as a Republican,"" Carter said in an interview with CBS News.

Katie Hobbs, left, and Kari Lake Brandon Bell/Getty Images, Brandon Bell/Getty Images

She said Arizona's abortion ban on can ""create unintended consequences that are dangerous for women,"" and will turn Arizona into a ""vigilante state for women receving healthcare.""

Carter says she's urging Republican voters to cross party lines this fall. ""I am asking you to vote for sanity,"" she said.

Abortion is also a key issue driving the Arizona Senate race. According to the new CBS News poll, Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Kelly leads GOP nominee Blake Masters 51% to 48%.

Like Democratic candidates elsewhere in the country, Kelly enjoys a wide lead among voters who say abortion is very important. More than seven in 10 likely Arizona voters who say abortion is very important in their vote for senator prefer Kelly over Masters.

Republican Peggy Neely, a former elected official in Phoenix, said abortion access is the reason she's going to vote for Kelly, rather than Masters.

""He's too extreme,"" Neely said. ""We cannot have Blake Masters representing us as a women to make sure that our rights are protected.""

Some Republican voters have said they're open to supporting Democrats in November because of the abortion rights issue.

""We need to leave women's bodies alone. As a man, we have no right, we should shut up,"" said Jorge Santana, a lifelong registered Republican who works in higher education. Speaking with CBS News at a farmers' market south of Phoenix, Santana said abortion rights are the main issue pushing him to vote for Democrats this fall.

For 21-year-old Maddie Merker, a student at Arizona State University, the recent change to the abortion law is motivating her to vote for Democrats as well. She said she wants to hear the candidates in the gubernatorial race talk more about environmental issues but acknowledged that abortion rights are the main issue driving her vote.

""People are going to get abortions, it is just if they are going to do it safely or not so it doesn't make sense to not let people do it because then it just puts more women at risk so I cannot agree with that,"" Merker said.

A day after the judge's ruling, Hobbs held a press conference promising to ""use every tool at my disposal to restore abortion rights in Arizona."" That led to her campaign's best fundraising week of cycle with over $1.2 million in grassroots donations fueled by reproductive rights advocates.

Lake's campaign has continued to focus on immigration, education and the economy, but the Republican nominee was asked about the abortion ruling in an appearnce on Fox News recently.

""I'm pro-life. I've never backed away from that and never will,"" Lake said. ""The Democrats have tried to politicize the issue in such a disturbing way,"" she added.

On her campaign website, Lake says ""we must also support people who choose to act responsibly when they are not ready to have a child, and that means making all common forms of birth control available over-the-counter and providing assistance to those who are financially unable to pay for their own birth control.""

In Tucson, Lake supporters like Karen Kosha agree there should be certain exceptions like rape and incest for abortion, ""but to use it as a birth control, and that is what a lot of Americans are doing, no, I don't support birth control by killing the babies.""

Retired retail worker Jan McSheffrey told CBS News that she's a lifelong Republican and will vote for Lake because of her stance on abortion. ""Abortion is basically child sacrifice in my estimation,"" McSheffrey said on Sunday before a Lake event in Tucson.

Small business owner Beth Rouin said she has voted for Democrats including Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, but she plans to support the Republican ticket in Arizona this year. She voted for former president Trump in 2016 and 2020 but said she's not a ""blind Trumper,"" adding that she likes Lake because ""she is not afraid to speak her mind.""

Rouin said abortion rights should be left up to the states, adding that women in Arizona who want the procedure can always drive to California.

""I am against it, but I also think a lot of women are backed up against the wall when they make that choice so I kind of understand it,"" Rouin said.

Two recent polls showed Hobbs leading Lake by one point with less than six weeks before Election Day. Both polls indicated abortion rights as one of the top issues for voters.

According to a Suffolk University / Arizona Republic poll, abortion is a significant motivation for women voters in Arizona. More than seven in 10 Democratic women ranked the issue as their top priority this year, compared to 49% of independent women and 37% of Republican women said the same.

The close gubernatorial race is drawing attention from national GOP figures as well. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, of Texas, is holding rallies with Kari Lake and Republican nominee for Senate Blake Masters on Tuesday and Wednesday in the state.

On Sunday, Trump will also campaign for Lake and Masters in Arizona.",Q4

At the time, only the Chicago Sun-Times had seen the text of the proposed legislation, but since then the first draft has been released for all to see. Dan Eldridge, who owns Maxon’s Shooter’s Supplies in Des Plaines, is among those who’ve gone over the text with a fine-toothed comb, and he’s now sounding the alarm to gun owners and Second Amendment supporters across the state.

As Eldridge details in a recent post on Maxon’s website, the particulars of HB 5855 “should horrify any gun owner.”

Major trouble areas of the bill: State-wide registry of all currently owned “Assault Weapons”

Ban on sales of “Assault Weapons”

Ban on sale and possession of all (long gun and hand gun) magazines holding more than 10 rounds

Raise the age for FOID eligibility to 21

Firearm Restraining Orders extend from the current 6 to 12 months This bill has an immediate effective date, as soon as the Governor signs it. Possession of all 10+ round magazines is illegal. Manufacture, possession, delivery, sale, and purchase of assault weapons (p. 53-65) is illegal. Only weapons personally owned before the effective date are exempt and must be registered with the State Police 300 days after the Governor signs this legislation. Hello Registry! And you must pay $25 to register your “assault rifles.” This includes all pistols with threaded barrels.

So, no grandfather clause in the magazine ban; a small detail that the bill’s primary sponsor left out of his talking points to the Sun-Times. As Eldridge sarcastically points out, at least you’ll “only” be guilty of a misdemeanor offense if you forget about that spare Glock 17 mag.

Meanwhile, after the 300 day registration period has ended, any Illinois resident caught with an unregistered “assault weapon,” even one they’ve legally owned for years, will be committing a felony offense subject to prison time and massive fines.

The chances of derailing this bill in the legislature seem slim, and Eldridge is already vowing to be a part of the inevitable lawsuit to come if and when HB 5855 is signed by Gov. J.B. Pritzker, which could come as early as next month. But Eldridge also rips lawmakers for their criminal justice “reform” efforts that will allow individuals accused of committing a host of violent offenses to walk out of jail without having to post bail or bond, no matter their flight risk or threat to the community, while rushing to turn hundreds of thousands of legal gun owners into criminals simply for keeping the guns and magazines that they lawfully purchased.

In a post-Bruen and Heller world, this sort of ban is facially unconstitutional. AR15-pattern rifles and duty-sized pistols are in common use and thus fall under the protection of the 2nd amendment after Bruen. There are further constitutional issues to argue in addition to the 2nd: 4th and 14th amendment violations are obvious. We will not argue the merits of this “assault weapons” ban. The other side is pandering to emotionally driven people who know nothing about guns, and they cannot be reasoned with nor can they be persuaded of the futility and unconstitutionality of this act. This proposed ban is a sad exhibit of how degraded politics and politicians have become in this state. Rather than work with the industry and law enforcement to reduce the criminal misuse of firearms (hint, hint: incarcerate criminals, and keep those accused of violent crimes in prison pending trial), the Democrat ILGA gun control enthusiasts prefer to pit one group against another. They are cowardly bullies, and the outcome will be further polarization of the politics of this state, deterioration of any constructive dialog, and the squandering of taxpayer funds when we win and are awarded court costs.

I’ll add one more outcome to the list of Dan’s predictions: a run on “large capacity” magazines and so-called assault weapons from now until the day the law takes effect. In an attempt to curb the sales of those items, anti-gun politicians are instead going to generate a massive interest in acquiring one (or more) modern sporting rifle and as many magazines as they can find before they’re banned.

We’ll be talking a lot more about the impending ban coming up next week on Bearing Arms Cam & Co, but in the meantime I encourage every Illinois gun owner to take this threat seriously. Democrats may believe they have the votes locked in, but your lawmakers still need to hear from you; not only reaching out now but signing up to testify in opposition during committee hearings if possible. The flagrant violations of constitutionally protected rights found within HB 5855 will be challenged in a court of law in due time, but in the meantime they should be challenged in the court of public opinion and in the statehouse every day between now and when they take effect.",Q4

Climate change is increasing the risk of floods across the United States, so a business owner in Philadelphia found a way to adapt. On this Halloween, here's WHYY's Sophia Schmidt.

SOPHIA SCHMIDT, BYLINE: OK, we're rounding a corner. I'm, like, genuinely scared.

I'm in a haunted house, approaching a hidden chamber that was revealed when floodwaters receded last fall - at least that's according to the story.

All right. There is, like, ominous music. It's very winding. So there's a lot of, like, blind corners. (Screaming) OK.

Inside the chamber is evidence of horrifying experiments a fictional mill owner did on his employees about a century ago. I should mention I don't normally go to haunted houses, so I'm pretty terrified.

Oh, God. OK. There's, like, a bunch of old equipment, which I think might be the textile mill. OK, there is, like, a head - like, a really scary head.

There's plenty of gore, human puppets, a big, bloody fish. Costumed actors are waiting in dark corners, ready to scare anyone who dares to walk through.

UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) There's no escape here for you.

SCHMIDT: The haunted house is in an old mill building along the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia, and it has a story of its own. It was flooded last year during the remnants of Hurricane Ida. The building owner, Brian Corcodilos, heads an architecture and design firm in the neighborhood and co-created the haunted house. But when Corcodilos first bought the building, he had other plans.

BRIAN CORCODILOS: I bought it in March of 2021. And then Ida hit in September of '21 - totally wiped it out, so...

SCHMIDT: Corcodilos showed me how high the flood waters reached.

CORCODILOS: The water was essentially, you know, seven feet up on this first floor that we're standing on. And prior to this, no water had ever hit in this floor before.

SCHMIDT: Corcodilos says the flood caused over a million dollars' worth of damage to the big stone building along the river. It wiped out a commercial kitchen from back when the building housed a popular bar. The flood also took out elevator equipment, flooring, drywall and the building's entire back deck. Corcodilos tried to find another bar or restaurant to rent space in the building but...

CORCODILOS: Every time someone came here to look at the space, it was - where'd the water come to, was the first question. And I would point up onto the ceiling like I did to you earlier. And you could see their eyes get a little big and go, I don't know about this.

SCHMIDT: So he opted for a different business model, one that wouldn't require so much permanent infrastructure, like a kitchen, that could get damaged in the future as climate change increases Philly's flood risk. He also made some changes to the building, like adding flood vents around the foundation to protect the structure by letting water flow in and out. He moved major electrical systems up to the second floor. And he built what he calls the concrete bathtub.

CORCODILOS: So the whole first floor has concrete on it now. We have, like, concrete and stucco up the walls. So if it does flood again, it's not drywall that we're ripping apart.

SCHMIDT: The haunted house is inside this bathtub. Its maze-like walls are made of drywall, but they're movable and temporary. Corcodilos' plan is to have a new pop-up event each quarter - something like nightmare before Christmas, scary Valentine's Day or an escape room.

CORCODILOS: So when it floods again, I get - hopefully it's not in my lifetime. When it floods again, this building won't be as damaged.

SCHMIDT: He's keeping the space flexible to accommodate whatever comes from the river.

https://dailycaller.com/2022/12/21/tucker-carlson-border-ukraine-zelensky/,Tucker Carlson Hammers Congress For ‘Fawning’ Over Zelenskyy While The ‘American Border Collapses Completely’,"Tucker Carlson lit into Congress Wednesday for “fawning” over Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as the United States’ southern border “collapses completely.”

“As the American border collapses completely, our Congress turns its fawning attention to the Ukraine and the man our congress has been funding with the tax dollars to prosecute a war whose consequences can be more profound than most Americans understand,” Carlson said as Zelenskyy concluded his address to a joint meeting of Congress. (RELATED: US To Announce $1.8 Billion In Weapons Aid For Ukraine Ahead Of Zelenskyy’s Expected Visit To DC: REPORT)

Zelenskyy met with President Joe Biden in the White House prior to his Wednesday evening address to Congress, the Washington Times reported. During his address to Congress, Zelenskyy called aid to Ukraine an “investment” in protecting democracy around the world.

United States Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) encountered over 2.3 million migrants in Fiscal Year 2022, with another 230,000 in October, the first month of the new fiscal year, according to official figures, while another 600,000 migrants evaded CBP, Fox News reported. The Supreme Court is debating a request by the Biden administration to allow Title 42, a Trump administration public health measure, to expire after pausing a ruling by U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan that would have ended the use of the provision Wednesday.

WATCH:

“We were reminded of it today when the president of Ukraine arrived at the White House dressed like the manager of a strip club and started to demand money. Amazingly, no one threw him out and instead they did whatever he wanted. ‘American taxpayers,’ declared Joe Biden, ‘will continue to give Zelenskyy whatever he demands for as long as it takes’” Carlson said after the speech ended.

Russia invaded Ukraine Feb. 24, launching a massive attack across the latter country. Congress added $45 billion in aid to Ukraine as part of a $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill that also prohibited United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) from spending over $1.5 billion to “acquire, maintain, or extend border security technology and capabilities, except for technology and capabilities to improve Border Patrol processing.”

“Tellingly Biden never specified what it is, as long as it is to do what? Push the Russian army back to pre-invasion borders? Sounds reasonable. That’s what most Americans likely assume, those who are still paying attention. But that is not what Zelensky means, and it is not what he’s asking for,” Carlson said. “Zelensky is demanding regime change in Russia, just like in Iraq and Libya and a long list of other failed states, except this time in the heart of the Eurasian landmass, next door to the entire civilized world. That’s what Zelensky has called for repeatedly and every dollar we send to him goes toward that end. At this point, he’s getting a lot closer to achieving it, so what happens if he ‘wins?’ What does the ensuing chaos look like? Thought about that?”

Carlson’s comments came as Biden announced the United States would give Ukraine a battery of MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missiles Wednesday, according to the Washington Post.

https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/awards/story/2022-12-18/chinonye-chukwu-director-emmett-mamie-till,How the tragic story in ‘Till’ chronicles the rise of an activist consciousness,"“I see this story as the journey of a woman who develops an activist consciousness, somebody who’s content in her own bubble and then her bubble bursts,” says “Till” director Chinonye Chukwu of her story about Mamie Till-Mobley, mother to slain teen Emmett Till.

In her youth, filmmaker Chinonye Chukwu learned the story of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old Chicago boy who in 1955 was kidnapped and brutally murdered during a trip to Mississippi. But it took her longer to learn about Mamie Till-Mobley, Till’s mother, whose push to publish the photo of her son’s mutilated body in Jet magazine galvanized the public.

“I remember the photo of Mamie grieving,” Chukwu says, “but not the connection between what Mamie did and the civil rights movement.”

With her new film “Till,” Chukwu, whose previous film “Clemency” made her the first Black woman to win the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, has gotten Hollywood to finally turn its attention to Till-Mobley’s story.

Till-Mobley was clearly attuned to the power of visuals and wanted the story of her son’s lynching to be made into a feature film. “Mamie wanted this story told in the mid-’50s,” Chukwu says. But “the stories of Black women on-screen don’t tend to be valued as much as others.”

Speaking by phone from New York City, Chukwu says that she sees “Till” as a film about politics, even if it doesn’t lead with ideology.

“I see this story as the journey of a woman who develops an activist consciousness, somebody who’s content in her own bubble and then her bubble bursts. I wanted to do a character study, so that’s how I initially approached it. Once you really communicate the humanity of a character, then you can really pull the audience into feeling and experiencing the politics.”

“Till” is exquisitely attuned to structures of feeling. Its vivid recreation of mid-century Chicago includes bold wallpaper and bright dresses, and Chukwu’s directorial choices lend key scenes the grandeur of portraiture. In the film’s most striking sequence, Mamie’s emotionally wrenching trial testimony is captured in a single unbroken shot.

According to Chukwu, the long take wasn’t intentional. She had a handful of other setups planned for the scene.

“Long takes shouldn’t be done just because they’re cinematically fun or interesting,” she says. “Every time I discuss shots with my cinematographer, it’s always from a place of ‘What’s going on in the story?’ So, we wanted to show Mamie navigating the emotional complexity and tension of the different gazes in the courtroom. I wanted to capture that and not break away from it. And I wanted to engross the actors and the audience in what she’s saying and feeling, so we can be there with her and feel it too.”

The scene works in large part due to the presence of actress Danielle Deadwyler, who conjures Mamie’s strength and suffering in equal measure.

“We were looking for Mamie for a few months,” Chukwu says, “and then [Danielle] sent in an audition tape. She blew everybody away.”

Chukwu called the actress back for a director’s session and used the scene where Mamie is looking at her son’s body in the funeral home. “There’s no dialogue,” Chukwu says. “I chose that scene intentionally, to see if she could do the deep work to communicate the emotional arc of that scene, without any words.” From the director’s perspective, what Deadwyler brought to the role is an ability “to get vulnerable and get underneath and in between the words on the page.”

Chukwu and her lead actress did their research to understand Mamie’s struggle to maintain composure as a grieving mother on the public stage.

“In the memoir [Mamie] co-wrote, she was so articulate about her interior space and what was going on emotionally,” Chukwu says. “One of the things we discussed extensively was what was going on psychologically from moment to moment, in terms of the public versus the private.”

Awards How ‘Till’ stands out among civil rights movies “Till” departs from many past movies about the civil rights movement in one crucial respect: It places its Black characters front and center in their struggle, rather than giving them roles subsidiary to white saviors.

The story of Mamie’s activism, as told through “Till,” is about finding the reserves of strength to make a private tragedy echo loudly in the public sphere. Chukwu’s filmmaking negotiates that public-private boundary in nearly every scene.

Although “Till” does not visually depict Emmett’s lynching, Chukwu finds a way of showing Emmett’s body that strikes a balance between the tender and the unflinching. When the scene begins, Mamie is standing alongside her husband and the coroner, and Emmett’s body is obscured by a table. Once the two men leave, and Mamie is alone with her son, the camera reveals the full picture.

“I knew that I didn’t want to show the physical violence,” she says. “And I also knew that I was going to show his body as an extension of Mamie’s decision to have the world witness what was done to her son. I decided we needed a humanizing lens through Mamie’s perspective, her emotional relationship to her son’s body, as opposed to the camera taking on the lens of a voyeur.”

Chukwu’s historical drama represents a belated recognition of Till-Mobley’s courage, but she infuses it with the urgency of the contemporary.

“This is a story that is so deeply tied to our present reality,” Chukwu says. “It is prioritizing a Black gaze. It is centering Black women. It is also uplifting, showing love, joy and community alongside the inherent pain of being a Black person in the world. I was very excited about presenting this story in that way.”",Q4

By Jasmine Guillory. ★★★½ (out of four). Out now.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

At least half of Guillory’s latest romance novel takes place in the bedroom, so if you’re uncomfortable with literature that gets down and dirty, this book’s not for you. But if your reading preferences are more rom than com, you’ll love this steamy tale of Napa Valley vineyard owner Margot and tech exec Luke, who have a passionate fling at his place after meeting at a local bar. Unfortunately, the no-strings-attached one-night stand puts Margot in a bind when Luke shows up for his first day of work at Noble Family Vineyards and she learns he’s her newest employee. Each has secrets to hide and walls to break down, and Guillory allows her characters to tackle them in a way that’s relatable. Guillory also demonstrates why she's a bestselling author as she weaves in more serious threads about race and identity, what it means to be recognized and what it means to be successful. You'll be cheering for Margot and Luke until you turn the last page. – Leigh Harrington

'The American Roommate Experiment'

By Elena Armas. ★★★★ (out of four). Out now.

When Rosie Graham hears someone breaking into her apartment – OK, her best friend’s apartment, her best friend who doesn’t technically know she’s using it – she isn’t prepared for it to be her roommate’s pro surfer cousin, Lucas Martin, the one she’s been obsessively following on socials. She’s less prepared for them to become de facto roommates and partners in a quest to jumpstart the stalled-out draft of her latest romance novel. “The American Roommate Experiment” is the follow-up to Armas’ huge-on-TikTok “The Spanish Love Deception” (yes, Aaron and Lina make cameos) with a new twist on the Spain-Meets-New York story. Rosie and Lucas’ connection deepens with every swoony, steamy date – you’ll want to get swept up too. – Jennifer Ernst Beaudry

'Lizzie Blake’s Best Mistake'

By Mazey Eddings. ★★★½ (out of four). Out now.

When a two-night stand turns into a lot more than Lizzie Blake bargained for, she sets her determined yet attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder mind on making a platonic relationship work with the too-hot-to-handle Australian baby daddy, Rake. For his part, Rake is actually quite a gentleman. And for reasons we must patiently wait to discover, he wants nothing more than to be an equal part of raising their unexpected child. Steamy scenes and smart writing will keep you wanting more as Lizzie and Rake navigate real-life circumstances and grapple with unrealistic boundaries. While the “unwanted feelings” loop that Lizzie and Rake create gets a bit repetitive, it gives us time to root for Lizzie’s success in a secret, sultry baking endeavor. Eddings sets this story up for not one, but two satisfying climaxes as Lizzy triumphs over her “fritzy” brain and her family, to turn all of her past (and present) “mistakes” into a very happy ever after. – Danielle DeSiato

https://freebeacon.com/national-security/lawmakers-press-for-iran-envoy-to-be-axed-nuclear-negotiations-halted/,"Lawmakers Press for Iran Envoy To Be Axed, Nuclear Negotiations Halted","The Biden administration is facing congressional pressure to fire U.S. special envoy for Iran Robert Malley and suspend nuclear negotiations with the hardline regime in the wake of a growing protest movement that threatens to topple the Islamic Republic.

Rep. Pat Fallon (R., Texas), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, issued these demands in a letter sent Tuesday to the White House and obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.

""The leadership in Iran,"" Fallon wrote, ""is beyond reform and deserves nothing from the civilized world. The United States must lead through action, not empty rhetoric."" President Joe Biden must ""remove Rob Malley as U.S. special envoy for Iran and permanently halt negotiations on a revival of the [Iran nuclear deal] or a lesser than agreement.""

Fallon is one of the first lawmakers to call for Malley's resignation in the wake of a protest movement that has swept across Iran and led to a deadly crackdown by the country's theocratic government. The Biden administration has faced criticism from Iranian dissident groups for its muted response to what could be a burgeoning revolution in Iran after more than 40 years of oppressive rule. While the administration has condemned the Iranian government's human rights crimes and issued some new economic sanctions, it has stopped short of expressing support for the protesters' calls to oust Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Malley is seen as the administration's most prominent supporter of the Iranian government, given his ongoing attempts to revive the 2015 nuclear accord and solidify the regime's grip on power.

""Enough is enough,"" Fallon wrote in his letter to Biden. The United States must immediately get serious about helping Iranian protesters realize their goals of removing the regime from power, he said.

In addition to firing Malley, the Biden administration must rally U.S. allies to isolate the Iranian government by cutting off trade and all diplomatic relations, Fallon said.

The United States should also initiate efforts at the United Nations to reimpose all international sanctions that were lifted as part of the original 2015 nuclear deal, Fallon wrote. This option, known as ""snapback,"" is a dispute resolution mechanism written into the original agreement that allows any U.N. member nation to trigger the reimposition of sanctions if Iran is found to be in violation of the deal. The Biden administration has refrained from exercising this right to avoid upsetting the Iranian government amid its diplomatic efforts.

Fallon also directs the Biden administration to begin enforcing a cadre of sanctions that were ""loosened because of the negotiations"" with Tehran. These include executive orders issued by the Trump administration that sanction Iran's banking institutions, oil trade, precious metals sector, and other industries controlled by Khamenei and his allies.

Iranian officials tied to the regime's human rights abuses—which include the imprisonment of more than 14,000 protesters and the murder of others—should be barred from entering the United States as part of renewed efforts to isolate the regime, Fallon says in his letter.

The United States should also undertake efforts to thwart Iranian terror operations across the Middle East and provide allies with the resources they need to crack down on Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which is funding and orchestrating terror attacks across the region, according to Fallon.

The Biden administration must also increase its efforts to provide the Iranian people with internet access, a primary tool used to keep the protest movements alive and coordinate anti-regime activities. Since the protests broke out last month, the Iranian regime has attempted to disrupt these networks and plunge Iranian dissidents into darkness.

""This policy of appeasement must end,"" Fallon told the Free Beacon. ""That starts with the removal of Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley, permanently halting nuclear negotiations with this thuggish regime, and by substantively supporting courageous Iranian protesters.""

Malley's position in the administration has become more tenuous since the protests erupted and negotiations over a revamped nuclear deal hit a stalemate. Malley and the State Department have declined in recent weeks to state that Iranian protesters are calling for regime change, eliciting outcry from Iranian-American groups and others that say they have lost faith in Malley's ability to support the protest movement.

""Robert Malley will go down in the history books as the most ineffective and feckless State Department official of the last 50 years. It's time for him to go,"" Bryan Leib, executive director of Iranian Americans for Liberty, a grassroots group that supports democracy, told the Free Beacon last month.

Bryan Leib, executive director of Iranian Americans for Liberty, a grassroots group that supports democracy, who has led efforts to force Malley's ouster, told the Free Beacon that more lawmakers should be speaking out on the issue.

""Robert Malley has done nothing during the last 20 months to prove he is competent enough to be in this role—he should be taking orders at McDonalds—not leading negotiations between our country and the world's leading sponsor of terrorist groups,"" Leib said. ""It's time for Malley to go.""

Fallon says that ongoing efforts to revive the nuclear deal, known as the JCPOA, are yet another sign the Biden administration is not serious about backing Iran's citizenry in its quest for freedom.

https://www.prokerala.com/news/articles/a1359914.html,"Khalistanis in US, UK, Canada plan protest to seek release of KLF activist Jaggi Johal from jail","New Delhi, Nov 3: Khalistani supporters of Jaggi Johal, 34, who is lodged in Delhi's Tihar jail, have launched a fresh worldwide campaign to get him freed from India. Johal is a citizen of the UK.

Jaggi Johal aka Jagtar Singh Johal was arrested by Punjab police on November 4, 2017, in Jalandhar under the arms Act. He got married on October 18, 2017, and was travelling in a car with his bride when police caught him midway.

Under the campaign christened 'Free Jaggi Now' the Khalistani activists have announced holding protests on November 4, in 5 cities of the US including New York and California. The Canadian radicals will gather in two cities, Toronto and Vancouver while In the UK protests will be held in four main cities including London and Manchester.

The free Jaggi protests are now directed toward the British - earlier they were targeting India - as a recent BBC report revealed that Jaggi was arrested in India on the basis of information provided by the intelligence agencies of the UK.

According to the BBC Johal's activities in the UK as a fundraiser for Sikh separatists active in Punjab were in the knowledge of the British intelligence agencies. He was also involved in translating pro-Khalistan Punjabi literature into English for publication in newspapers and on websites. This information was passed over to the Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) following which Johal was arrested by the Punjab police.

Jaggi has been named as an accused in seven cases, five of those being murder charges (targeted killings) and two being attempt to murder charges (attempted targeted killings). Activists and members of right-wing Hindu outfits, the Dera Sirsa followers, and even a Christian activist (a pastor) were targeted in these killings.

The case was later taken over by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The NIA found KLF militants Harminder Singh Mintoo, who died in 2018, and Hardeep Singh took a tour of France and Germany in June 2013. When they were in Paris, Mintoo and Gurjinder Singh Shastri went to the Paris airport and received Jagtar Singh Johal, who had arrived from the U.K. Johal had been sent to France by Gursharanbir Singh to deliver around 3000 euros to Mintoo.

Apart from Akal Takht Sahib and Shiromani Gurudwara Parbhandak Committee, many mainstream politicians in Britain, Canada and Punjab have been speaking sympathetically for Jaggi.

Johal's lawyer, Jaspal Singh Manjhpur, as quoted by the Indian Express, said, ""Total of 11 cases were registered against Jaggi Johal in India and eight of these cases are being investigated by the NIA, two by Punjab Police and one by Delhi Police Special Cell. Charge sheets have been filed in all the cases, however, the charges are framed only in one case that was registered by Punjab Police immediately after his arrest. Johal has already secured bail in three cases against him including the one in which charges are framed. He was discharged from one case that was registered by Punjab Police.""

A security guard was wounded in the attack Friday in the Afghan capital.

In a statement cited by jihadist monitor SITE, the Islamic State’s regional chapter said it had “attacked the apostate Pakistani ambassador and his guards”.

Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called it “an assassination attempt” on the head of the mission, and demanded an investigation.

A Kabul police spokesman said one suspect had been arrested and two light weapons seized after security forces swept a nearby building.

Although Pakistan does not officially recognise Afghanistan’s Taliban government, it kept its embassy open even as the hardline Islamists took over in August last year, and maintains a full diplomatic mission.

An embassy official told AFP a lone attacker “came behind the cover of houses and started firing”, but that the ambassador and other staff were safe.

A spokesman for Afghanistan’s foreign ministry said they strongly condemned the “failed attack”.

“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan will not allow any malicious actors to pose a threat to the security of diplomatic missions in Kabul,” it said in a statement, vowing to find and punish those responsible.

Pakistan has complicated relations with the Taliban, with Islamabad long accused of supporting the Islamists even while backing the US-led invasion of Afghanistan that toppled them following the 9/11 attacks.

Pakistan is home to more than a million Afghan refugees, and the porous border they share is frequently the scene of clashes.

Since returning to power, the Afghan Taliban have insisted they would not allow foreign militant groups to operate from home soil. — AFP",Q4
https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-12-20/california-judge-rejects-new-murder-trial-for-scott-peterson,California judge rejects new murder trial for Scott Peterson,"Scott Peterson, who was convicted in the 2002 deaths of his wife and their unborn son, listens during a hearing at the San Mateo County Superior Court in February.

A California judge on Tuesday rejected a new murder trial for Scott Peterson, nearly 20 years after he was charged with dumping the bodies of his pregnant wife, Laci, and the unborn child they planned to name Conner into San Francisco Bay on Christmas Eve 2002.

Peterson alleged the resulting trial that gripped the world was tainted by a rogue juror who lied about her own history of abuse to get on the panel that initially sent him to death row.

Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo found there was no evidence to support the defense claim that Juror No. 7, Richelle Nice, committed misconduct during jury selection.

Nice did not intentionally conceal information about her life on the jury questionnaire or misrepresent her financial situation to stay on the jury, and did not appear vengeful toward Peterson in letters she later wrote him in prison, Massullo said.

“The Court concludes that Juror No. 7’s responses were not motivated by pre-existing or improper bias against [Peterson], but instead were the result of a combination of good faith misunderstanding of the questions and sloppiness in answering,” the judge wrote in her decision.

Peterson, now 50, can appeal her ruling.

California Scott Peterson is moved off California’s death row Peterson is moved off death row two years after the California Supreme Court overturned his death sentence for killing his pregnant wife in 2002.

It was undisputed that Nice failed to disclose as she was being selected for Peterson’s jury in 2004 that she had sought a restraining order while she was pregnant four years earlier. Nice said then that she “really fears for her unborn child” because of threats from her boyfriend’s ex-girlfriend.

The California Supreme Court in 2020 found that Nice’s actions required a hearing to determine if they denied Peterson a fair trial, and assigned Judge Massullo to the case. The high court separately threw out Peterson’s death sentence in 2020, and Stanislaus County prosecutors decided against seeking his execution even as they argued he received a fair trial. He was resentenced to life in prison last December.

Peterson argued that Nice fought to join the jury despite her financial hardship and that she entered deliberations determined to enact revenge for Peterson’s nearly full-term unborn child, the young victim she nicknamed “Little Man.”

But Nice testified that she had no bias against Peterson until she heard the evidence against him.

Nice said in a sworn declaration in 2020 that it did not occur to her to include the threat to her own unborn child on her juror form because she did not “feel ‘victimized’ the way the law might define that term.” She later testified that she answered truthfully based on her understanding of the questions.

“I didn’t write it on the questionnaire because it never crossed my mind, ever. It wasn’t done intentionally,” she swore during two days of testimony in February.

She also disputed any financial motive to serving on the jury, swearing that she and other jurors never discussed jointly writing their book, “We, the Jury,” until after the trial and verdict.

And it was Peterson’s celebrity attorney, Mark Geragos, who wanted her on the jury, prosecutors said. Geragos called Nice back as she prepared to leave after the trial judge dismissed her for financial hardship, though Geragos said he never would have done so had she properly disclosed her personal history.

Nice also denied being biased even though she said her boyfriend at the time was serially unfaithful and denied that he ever assaulted her despite his arrest on a domestic violence charge.

Peterson was arrested in April 2003 only after his mistress came forward to say he told her his 27-year-old wife was gone a month before her actual disappearance.

His attorneys provided Massullo with what they called a “Credibility Chart” purporting to show Nice’s conflicting statements.

“Ms. Nice simply forgot,” prosecutors responded in court filings, arguing that any mistakes she made did not demonstrate bias.

“Her testimony and her demeanor ... clearly showed she was not a vengeful, scorned woman who sought to punish [Peterson],” they argued.

Among other issues Massullo had to decide was which side had the burden of proof.

Prosecutors said Peterson’s attorneys failed to prove Nice committed juror misconduct. Inadvertent or unintentional mistakes don’t count, they argued.

Peterson’s attorneys said Nice clearly concealed facts during jury selection, even unknowingly, which they said shifts the burden to prosecutors to prove that she wasn’t prejudiced.",Q4

His eight-stanza poem, Masjid-e-Qurtuba, was inspired by Andalusia’s Muslim heritage. (Courtesy: Iqbal Academy). The poet (right) in the courtyard of his Lahore house in the 1930s.

Pakistan’s ideological journey has reshaped the great poet philosopher Allama Muhammad Iqbal into a patron of its hardening worldview. Reviewing how he has been ‘reinterpreted’ into an ideological platitude is now hazardous because of his state-approved and clerically-backed identity as an orthodox thinker opposed to all modernist revision. At times, secular commentators longing for an identity rollback consign him to the category of ‘orthodox’ while praising Sir Syed Ahmad Khan as the true modernist. There is, however, steady evidence from his life that defies this orthodox labeling.

The climactic moment in Iqbal’s relationship with Pakistan came on December 25, 1986; some 48 years after his death. It happened during a national seminar presided over by General Ziaul Haq in Karachi on the birth anniversary of the founder of the state, Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. The topic of the seminar was, What is the Problem Number One of Pakistan? Present among the invitees was the son of Allama Iqbal, then a sitting judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. In his speech on the occasion, Justice Javed explained why his father was opposed to Hudood (Quranic punishments) which Gen Zia had promulgated in Pakistan.

The controversial phrasing from the Sixth Lecture in Allama Iqbal’s book, The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam, was: “The Shariat values (Ahkam) resulting from this application (e.g. rules relating to penalties for crimes) are in a sense specific to that people; and since their observance is not an end in itself they cannot be strictly enforced in the case of future generations.”

The reaction from Gen Zia was dismissive of Allama Iqbal rather than the Hudood he had imposed to appease his vast hinterland of clerical support. He had gotten into trouble with the clergy when his Federal Shariat Court decided that since stoning to death (Rijm) was not mentioned in the Quran it could not be a Hadd, that is, a punishment in the Penal Code. He had to change the Court to retain Rijm.

But Iqbal was prophetic: Pakistan has not stoned a single woman to death despite Rijm being on the statute book, nor has it been able to chop off hands for stealing. More literalist Iran gave up the ghastly practice of Rijm in 2014.

Pakistan is disturbed today by the continuing practice of bank interest after the Federal Shariat Court banned it in 1991 as Riba (usury) specifically mentioned in the Quran as also by Aristotle in his Nicomachian Ethic. Islamic banking which actually excludes the taking of Riba does so under a policy of complex self-confessed Heela (subterfuge).

In his publication Ilmul Iqtisad (1904), Iqbal’s first book in Urdu as an introduction to how a modern economy worked, he explained and clearly accepted bank interest as the lifeblood of commerce, knowing that it was considered banned by the clerics and accounted for so few Muslims in India’s commercial sector. He did so by accepting Sir Syed Ahmad Khan’s view that “interest-banking was not the same as Riba/usury”.

HUDOOD AND IJTIHAD

Iqbal couldn’t have found approval in the Pakistan of today, much like Jinnah himself after he declared his preference for the Lockean state on August 11, 1947. To extend the argument, Iqbal was also opposed to the Fiqh (case law) favouring the Law of Evidence that discriminated against women and the non-Muslim citizens of the state. That he was unhappy with and scared of the traditionalist Ulema is testified by his arguments in the Lectures; there is also evidence that he inclined to a ‘liberal’ version of Islam in the new state.

Towards the end of his life he was collecting material to write on Fiqh and had been corresponding with the traditionalist Ulema to elucidate points that he presumably wanted discussed in his new work. He was not a trained scholar (Aalim) and was not accepted as such by the Ulema, but he thought himself qualified to produce a work of Ijtihad (reinterpretation). His son, the late Justice Javed Iqbal, wrote: “The Jinnah-Iqbal correspondence, discussing shariah, points to the establishment of a state based on Islam’s welfare legislation; it does not propose that in the new state any laws pertaining to cutting of the hands (for theft) and stoning to death (for fornication) would be enforced.”

According to Javed Iqbal’s biography of Allama Iqbal, Zindarood (1989), Allama Iqbal read his first thesis on Ijtihad in December 1924 at the Habibya Hall of Islamia College, Lahore. The reaction from the traditionalist Ulema was immediate: he was declared Kafir (non-believer) for the new thoughts expressed in the paper. Maulavi Abu Muhammad Didar Ali actually handed down a Fatwa (edict) of his apostasy. In a letter written to a friend, Iqbal opined that the Ulema had deserted the movement started by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan and were now under the influence of the Khilafat Committee from which he (Iqbal) had resigned.

Allama Iqbal’s intent in reinterpreting Hudood becomes clear when he quotes Maulana Shibli Numani, who had written Seerat-un-Nabi, his renowned multi-volume biography of the Holy Prophet: “It is therefore a good method to pay regard to the habits of society while considering punishments so that the generations that come after the times of the Imam are not treated harshly.”

LIKE NO OTHER

Allama Iqbal was a prodigy. In 1885, he stood first in grade one in Scotch Mission School, Sialkot, and began to be tutored in Persian and Arabic in a mosque. He was in class nine when as a teenager he started writing his juvenile poetry in Urdu. He passed matriculation in first division, winning a medal with scholarship. In his first year at Scotch Mission College, he started versifying under the pen-name of Iqbal and was published in literary journals.

He passed his BA exam in first division and won medals in Arabic and English. Three years later, though he passed his MA Philosophy in third division, he was the only one who passed and received the gold medal. He was appointed professor of Philosophy at the Government College, Lahore, chosen by Professor Thomas Arnold — the British orientalist who wrote a book proving that Islam was spread in the subcontinent not by the sword but by humanist preaching — who became his patron.

Iqbal was additionally appointed as the Macleod Arabic Reader at Oriental College, Lahore, on a monthly salary of 72 rupees and one anna. Later, he took time off from Oriental College to teach English at the Government College. His poems had started showing influence from Spinoza, Hegel, Goethe, Ghalib, Bedil, Emerson, Longfellow and Wordsworth.

He couldn’t disagree with Sir Syed Ahmad Khan whom he regarded as the Baruch Spinoza (d.1677) of Islam, rationalising and demystifying the scriptures. His job description at Oriental College included the teaching of Economics to the students of the Bachelor of Oriental Learning in Urdu, and translating into Urdu works from English and Arabic.

PIONEER OF SEPARATION

Lahore lionised Iqbal as the thinker poet of the city who could spellbind in a Mushaira while publishing erudite papers on such mystics as al-Jili whose concept of Insan al-Kamil was reborn in him with the help of Nietzsche and his ‘superman’ and ‘will to power’ but without Nietzsche’s rejection of morality – his “not goodness but strength” slogan. This was before he went to Europe (1905-08) doing his Master’s and Bar at Cambridge and his PhD with his thesis, ‘The Evolution of Metaphysics in Iran’ at the Munich University, becoming unbelievably proficient in German within three months.

The period 1908-25, back in Lahore, saw him produce some of his Urdu masterpieces while practicing law at the Lahore High Court. Reacting to Hindu revivalist movements, he journeyed from his pluralist view of India to a ’preservative posture, advocating separate electorates and developing the first geographical map of ‘separation’ of the Muslim community in the northeast and the southeast within the subcontinent. All-India Muslim League courted him as the leading Muslim genius and listened to his ‘separatist’ thesis at its Allahabad session in 1930.

He contended that his idea of an autonomous Muslim state was not original but had been derived from the Arya Samaj Hindu revivalist vision of Lala Lajpat Rai of Punjab who first recommended ‘separating’ the Muslims. The view he put forward in his address remained pluralist which Pakistan neglected in 1949: “… [N] or should the Hindus fear that the creation of autonomous Muslim states will mean the introduction of a kind of religious rule in such states”.

As for Iqbal’s Nietzschean yearning for self-empowerment, Jinnah was made a practical example of it, as noted oddly by none other than Saadat Hasan Manto in one of his sketches.

Jinnah said this at the 1937 Lucknow session of the League: “It does not require political wisdom to realise that all safeguards and settlements would be a scrap of paper, unless they are backed up by power. Politics means power and not relying only on cries of justice or fair-play or goodwill.” It was this separate empowerment of Muslims in the face of such Hindu revivalist movements as Shuddhi (purification) and Sangathan (unification) that made Iqbal disagree with the Deobandi scholar Husain Ahmad Madani over the idea of India as a nation-state where Muslims and Hindus would live as one nation.

Like Lala Lajpat Rai, another Indian genius, Dr B.R. Ambedkar, the architect of India’s constitution, wanted Muslims to be given a separate state and wrote his book Thoughts on Pakistan (1941) which was welcomed by Jinnah who then asked everyone to read it to legitimise the League’s campaign for Pakistan.

ON THE SAME PAGE WITH JINNAH

Iqbal’s legally trained mind and his ability to write scholarly tracts quite apart from his ability to write the long poem or masnavi — abandoned by most poets of note after him — qualified him for all the three Round Table Conferences in London to present the case of the Muslims. His Allahabad address at the All-India Muslim League conference in 1930 was actually a learned survey of the nature of the modern state as imagined by such Western philosophers as Rousseau and could not have been comprehended by most Muslim Leaguers still basking in the afterglow of a doomed Khilafat Movement.

Noting that Pakistan’s non-Muslims observe the Independence Day of Pakistan three days earlier, Dawn editorialised on August 11, 2017, on how Pakistan first tried to suppress, then set aside, the August 11, 1947, message of the Quaid-i-Azam at the Constituent Assembly: “You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place of worship in this state of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed. That has nothing to do with the business of the state.”

It is not only the founder of the state, Quaid-i- Azam Jinnah, that Pakistan has set aside; it is also the philosopher of the state, Allama Mohammad Iqbal, who has been rejected. Seventy years after its foundation, the state is malfunctioning and religion is a major cause of the shifting of its writ to the non-state actors. Denigrated are human rights — of the minorities and women — on the basis of a coercive interpretation of religion. So much so, that the faith-based but unexamined constitutional provisions in Articles 62/63 have finally destabilised governance by causing conflict between state institutions.

He made the remarks while addressing reporters at the UN Security Council stakeout after charing a signature event held under India's presidency of the Council on 'Global Counterterrorism Approach: Challenges and Way Forward.

""In terms of what they are saying, the truth is everybody, the world today, sees them as the epicentre of terrorism,"" he said.

""I know we've been through two and a half years of Covid and a lot of us have brain fog as a result. But I assure you the world has not forgotten where terrorism emanates from, who has their fingerprints over a lot of activities in the region and beyond the region.

""So, I would say that it's something which they should remind themselves before indulging in the kind of fantasies which they do,"" he added.

Mr Jaishankar was responding to a question on Pakistan Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hina Rabbani Khar's recent allegation that ""no country had used terrorism better than India"".

He invoked US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who at a joint news conference in 2011 with then Pakistan Foreign Minister Khar, said: ""You can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours."" ""I read the reports on what Minister Hina Rabbani Khar said. And I was reminded, more than a decade ago, my memory serves me right. Hillary Clinton was visiting Pakistan. And Hina Rabbani Khar was a minister at that time,"" Mr Jaishankar said, while responding to a question on Khar's recent statements about a dossier against India.

""Standing next to her, Hillary Clinton actually said that if you have snakes in your backyard, you can't expect them to bite only your neighbours. Eventually, they will bite the people who keep them in the backyard. But as you know, Pakistan is not great on taking good advice. You see what's happening there,"" he said.

Pakistan should clean up its act and try to be a good neighbour, Mr Jaishankar said as he underlined that the world is not ""stupid"" and is increasingly calling out countries, organisations and people who indulge in terrorism.

""You know, you're asking the wrong Minister when you say how long will we do this? Because it is the Ministers of Pakistan who will tell you how long Pakistan intends to practice terrorism,"" Jaishankar said.

He was responding to a question by a Pakistani journalist on how long South Asia is going to see terrorism disseminating from New Delhi, Kabul, and Pakistan.

""At the end of the day, the world is not stupid, the world is not forgetful. And the world does increasingly call out countries and organisations and people who indulge in terrorism,"" he said.

""By taking that debate elsewhere, you are not going to hide it. You're not going to confuse anybody anymore. People have figured it out. So my advice is please clean up your act. Please try to be a good neighbour.

""Please try and contribute to what the rest of the world is trying to do today, which is economic growth, and progress and development,"" Mr Jaishankar said.

ORLANDO, Fla. — A Texas mother of a toddler, scraping by on her husband's income, was desperate to return to work but struggling to afford child care. A young Florida warehouse worker had barely left behind a turbulent past of homelessness and abuse only to be mired in debt.

When both women learned they were pregnant, they came to the agonizing conclusion they couldn't go through with it.

“When you try to discuss the alternatives, you find the problems. If we could do this, where is the baby going to stay?” said Alyssa Burns, the warehouse worker who makes $16 an hour and was sharing a two-bedroom apartment with her boyfriend and another couple when she found out she was pregnant last year. “We both work full-time jobs. My mom works. We can’t afford child care.”

There are wide-ranging reasons why women may seek to terminate their pregnancies but for those struggling to make ends meet, finances are inevitably part of the calculation. Now many of them will be thrust into a circumstance they can't afford as abortion bans and restrictions take hold in half the country after the Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling guaranteeing abortion rights.

Three-quarters of women who seek abortions were low-income, meaning they had a family income below or up to double the federal poverty level, according to a 2014 study by the Guttmacher Institute, a science-based research group that supports abortion rights. More than half already had children and many worked in physically demanding roles with fewer labor protections and less flexibility than higher-wage jobs.

“A salaried employee with benefits is the type of person who generally does find a way with or without their employer support,” said Caitlin Myers, an economist at Middlebury College who studies reproduction and the economy. “We are talking about a really economically fragile group of workers, often hourly workers, often shift workers with very unpredictable schedules for whom this becomes really overwhelming.”

Burns, 24, was able to swiftly end her just over six-week-old pregnancy in March 2021 because Florida had no law against it at the time and the state's current law bans most abortions after 15 weeks. But she said she is haunted by the idea that in a different state and a different time, she might have been forced to have the baby.

The Texas mother panicked at the same possibility. She learned she was pregnant in September of last year just as a Texas law banning all abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy took effect.

“I was so broken. I couldn’t fathom that it was happening,” said the 30-year-old hairstylist who, like Burns, shared her story through the women’s advocacy group MomsRising but requested anonymity for fear of facing harassment in her conservative Corpus Christi community. “I can’t afford this child. I am struggling with a child I already have.”

In the end, she was able to have an abortion in New Mexico with financial help from Planned Parenthood. Even so, she and her husband incurred $1,000 in expenses, including $500 in car rental. Her husband had to take unpaid time from his job as a cell phone tower maintenance worker.

If it hadn’t been for the Texas ban, she said she could have gone to a clinic 20 minutes away. Indeed, for many women living in states that would ban abortions, the average travel distance to the nearest clinic would rise from 35 miles to 272 miles, according to Myers’ analysis of a national database of abortion facilities, revised monthly.

Many anti-abortion advocates say the answer is not to make it easier to terminate a pregnancy but to widen the safety net and make it easier to have children. They argue Roe v. Wade hurt working women by discouraging employers and the government from enacting more generous benefits for parents.

“Abortion has been the privileged response to female poverty and the plight of low-wage workers in this country,” said Erika Bachiochi, an anti-abortion legal scholar who believes more pressure should be applied on conservative states to strengthen policies around parental leave and child care.

But research tells a different story. Carrying an unwanted pregnancy quadruples the odds that a woman and her child will live below the federal poverty line, according to The Turnaway Study, a University of California San Francisco research project that tracked women who got access to abortions versus those who’d been denied them over a 10-year period. It triples the chances of the woman being unemployed.

Being denied an abortion often leads to increased rates of unpaid debt, poverty, evictions, and bankruptcies over the next five years, according to a recent study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which used the Turnaway study data to exam the credit history of women who couldn't get abortions.

Those were some of the risks facing Burns, who left home at 18 and finished high school while living homeless. Although she had found some stability by the time she got pregnant, she was still paying off more than $7,000 in debt from breaking her rental lease a few years earlier when she left an abusive relationship.

Earlier this year, the Texas hairstylist moved in with her parents in Corpus Christi because life had become too expensive in Austin, where her monthly rent rose from $1,400 to $1,600 and putting her daughter in child care would have cost $600 a week. Her husband, who earns $50,000 a year with overtime, will join her once their lease term ends. With their parents able to watch her child, she was able to go back to work two days a week.

“We’ve been playing catch-up for the longest time,” she said.

Catherine R. Pakaluk, an anti-abortion assistant professor of social research and economic thought at the Catholic University of America, acknowledges the unique difficulties for low-income women but does not believe abortion is the right answer.

“Having a baby is harder when you’re poor. But I don’t think the poor’s interest or the elite’s interest are served by eliminating a child conceived into difficult circumstances,” Pakaluk said. “That’s why the poor should be 100% the focus of any kind of policymaking.”

In reality, however, states with some of the nation’s strictest abortion laws are among the hardest places to raise children, especially for the poor, according to an analysis of federal data by The Associated Press. In Mississippi, for instance, access to pre- and post-natal care has dwindled since the Supreme Court ruling in June, making childbirth even more dangerous for poor women and children.

There is also a big disparity between the benefits that employers offer low-income workers versus high-income workers. Roughly 6% of private industry workers with an average wage in the lowest 10% had access to paid family leave, compared with 43% workers in the top 10%, according to the most recent survey by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, conducted last year. And only 38% of private industry workers with wages at the bottom 10% get paid sick leave, compared with 96% in the top 10%, according to a labor department study done in March.

Burns said she and her boyfriend dream of eventually having a family but they need stability first. She has been able to go to the dentist for the first time in her life, getting cavities filled, wisdom teeth removed and some crowns put in, accruing more debt that would have been difficult to handle with a baby.",Q4

Liz Cheney says she won’t allow former President Trump to turn Jan. 6 testimony into circus,"The House committee investigating the Capitol riot won’t give Donald Trump the chance to turn a possible live TV appearance of his subpoenaed testimony into a “circus” and “food fight” as lawmakers try to ensure he complies with their demands, the panel’s vice chair said Sunday.

The committee is demanding Trump’s testimony under oath next month as well as records relevant to its investigation. To avoid a complicated and protracted legal battle, Trump reportedly had told associates he might consider complying with the subpoena if he could answer questions during live testimony.

When asked if the committee would consider taking his testimony live, Rep. Liz Cheney on Sunday did not directly respond. She said the committee would not allow Trump’s testimony to turn into a “food fight” on TV — much as was seen, she said, in Trump’s broadcast appearances such as one of his 2020 presidential debates — and she warned that the committee will take action if he does not comply with the subpoena.

“We are going to proceed in terms of the questioning of the former president under oath,” Cheney, R-Wyo., said on “Meet the Press” on NBC. “It may take multiple days, and it will be done with a level of rigor and discipline and seriousness that it deserves. We are not going to allow — he’s not going to turn this into a circus.”

Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., speaks as the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, holds a hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, Oct. 13, 2022.

“We have many, many alternatives that we will consider if the former president decides he is not going to comply with his legal obligation, a legal obligation every American citizen has to comply with a subpoena,” she said.

Her office made clear later that she and the Jan. 6 committee were not ruling out the possibility of live testimony. It did not indicate what form that might take to avoid the “food fight” or “circus” that Cheney said would not happen.

The subpoena, issued Friday, calls on Trump to hand over documents by Nov. 4 and provide testimony “on or about” Nov. 14.

It is unclear how Trump and his legal team will respond. He could comply or negotiate with the committee, announce he will defy the subpoena or ignore it altogether. He could go to court and try to stop it.

Last week, Steve Bannon, a longtime Trump ally, was sentenced to serve four months behind bars after defying a subpoena from the same committee. He remains free pending appeal. Former Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro also awaits a trial next month on similar contempt of Congress charges.

The subpoena includes requests for any communications referring to extremist groups who were coming to Washington, pressure on state legislators to overturn the 2020 election vote and messages about Vice President Mike Pence, whom Trump was pushing to object to President Joe Biden’s victory.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Sunday that she doubted Trump would appear for his deposition and that the public should know “that no one is above the law.”

“I don’t think he’s man enough to show up,” Pelosi said on MSNBC. “I don’t think his lawyers would want him to show up because he (would) had to testify under oath. … We’ll see.”

There remains little legal advantage for Trump to cooperate with the committee at a time when he faces other legal battles in various jurisdictions, including over his family business in New York and the handling of presidential records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

It’s possible that Trump’s lawyers could simply opt to run out the clock on the subpoena if they go to court to try to squash it as the committee of two Republicans and seven Democrats is required to finish its work by the end of the year.

Cheney, in the television interview, made her position clear that Trump had committed “multiple criminal offenses” and should be prosecuted. She cited his repeated efforts as outlined by the Jan. 6 committee to undermine democracy by denying his election loss to Biden and by spurring his supporters in the violent attack on the Capitol.

“We’ve been very clear about a number of different criminal offenses that are likely at issue here,” Cheney said. “If the Department of Justice determines that they have the evidence that we believe is there and they make a decision not to prosecute, I think that really calls into question whether or not we’re a nation of laws.”

Cheney, who lost in Wyoming’s August primary after becoming Trump’s fiercest GOP critic and has signaled a possible 2024 presidential run, expressed dismay over the number of Republican candidates in the Nov. 8 midterms who deny the legitimacy of the 2020 election. She acknowledged that the Jan. 6 committee’s investigation will be permanently ended in January if Republicans retake control of the House.

While saying it may take “a couple of election cycles,” Cheney insisted the Republican Party can find its way back as a defender of democracy and the Constitution, as she put it. She pointed to the 2024 presidential campaign as a pivotal moment.

“I think that the party has either got to come back from where we are right now, which is a very dangerous, toxic place, or the party will splinter and there will be a new conservative party that rises,” she said. “And if Donald Trump is the nominee of the Republican Party, the party will shatter and there will be a conservative party that rises in its place.”

She said Trump has shown “his willingness to use force to attempt to stop the peaceful transition of power. And there are simply many, many millions more Americans who, despite any party affiliation, understand how dangerous that is.”

On whether she could run in 2024, Cheney said: “I’m focused on what we’ve got to do to save the country from this dangerous moment we’re in … not right now on whether I’m going to be a candidate or not.”",Q4

His romance with the privately-educated mother-of-two, 37, supposedly begun during his highly publicised court battle with ex wife Amber Heard in Fairfax, Virginia.

The pair were seen shooting each other tender glances during his court case this spring and Rich was spotted travelling to court with Depp by car.

Rumoured split: Johnny Depp's romance with British lawyer Joelle Rich (right) has reportedly fizzled out barely months after it had begun - supposedly during the court battle with his ex-wife Amber Heard (pictured together at the time)

Johnny was seen saying hello to fans stood outside the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles on Sunday evening, where he was performing on his music tour with Jeff Beck in Los Angeles on Sunday.

Cutting a dapper figure, the actor and musician, 59, gave doted listeners a warm welcome before he left the venue.

The Edward Scissorhands actor wore a grey fedora hat with brown braided string around the base.

He wore an off-white striped shirt with rolled up sleeves, showcasing his many tattoos, and a grey waistcoat with black buttons.

When news of the liaison between Johnny and his now ex-lover Joelle Rich broke last month, it was said that they enjoyed 'off the scale chemistry'.

However there was no sign of the actor when Rich attended a family wedding in Ibiza last weekend and sources in New York believe that Depp's relationship was fizzling out — and may actually already be over.

A friend of Depp's said: 'Are they still an item? We are not talking about a normal couple here. It's not a big, stable, committed love affair and I'm not sure that it ever was.

'I don't know if they are together in any way at this point. Certainly I don't believe it is a serious romantic relationship, or even an exclusive one.'

The source added: 'Firstly, he has just come out of a massive legal battle [with ex-wife Amber Heard], so who would want to commit after that? It has been an extremely traumatic period for him.

Johnny kept it casual with a pair of black denim jeans and a pair of black leather boots, and accessorised with plenty of his signature silver bracelets, rings and some black sunglasses.

The 59-year-old kept a youthful, clean-shaven look - having shaved off his signature goatee.

Waving goodbye: Johnny's appearance on Sunday comes after Johnny reportedly split from London lawyer Joelle rich, 37, a privately-educated mother-of-two

The Pirates Of The Caribbean actor is currently on tour with rocker friend Jeff Beck.

Depp and Beck met in 2016 and became good friends, bonding over their shared love of music and cars.

They eventually started playing music together in 2019, and have toured in Europe ahead of their first US tour.

He looked in good spirits on Sunday evening, where he was accompanied by his bodyguard, giving the thumbs up and waving to fans as they waited outside.

Secondly, he's Johnny Depp and I don't think a standard committed relationship is going to be his thing.'

Chemistry: The pair were seen shooting each other tender glances during his court case this spring in Fairfax, Virginia (pictured at his court case at the High Court in London in 2020)

London friends of Rich say that her plans for a divorce from husband Jonathan are still progressing.

Joelle and Jonathan have two children and lived together in a £1.5 million house in North London. They were married in 2011.

Since the trial, in which Depp sued Heard over an article she wrote for the Washington Post, the actor has spent a few months in France making the French language film Jeanne du Barry, in which he plays Louis XV.

Since that wrapped last month he has taken up his music career again, playing dates in the U.S. with guitar hero Jeff Beck, and planning a UK tour next year with Alice Cooper in supergroup Hollywood Vampires.

Rich remains a partner at UK law firm Schillings and is said to earn £250,000 a year. She met Depp in 2018 when the company was hired to sue The Sun for libel, after the tabloid called him a wife-beater.

Depp lost his libel action, but the tables were turned in the U.S. trial against ex-wife Amber. It ended with humiliation for Heard, who was ordered to pay him £9.2 million in damages.

Jose Larin Garcia is accused of murdering four people in Palm Springs in 2019. His first trial ended earlier this year with a deadlocked jury.

Speaking in Spanish through a translator, Larin Garcia's mother grew emotional, sitting just feet from her son who has been in custody nearly four years.

The night of the murders, Garcia received a voicemail from her son. He told her he was going to be arrested and admitted he was intoxicated and scared.

After Larin Garcia escaped from the hospital, he went to a friend's home. The next morning, his mother went to visit him. She said he smelled like alcohol, and growing upset, she ""told him off."" She said she was not aware of the murders at the time.

Ms. Garcia went home to get clothes for Larin Garcia and a cell phone. She said she was aware her son had plans to go to Florida. That was the last time she saw him that day. Police later arrived at her home to search Larin Garcia's room.

Testimony continued Wednesday about the victims' autopsies, too. Pathologist Dr. Allison Hunt autopsied Yuliana Garcia and Carlos Campos Rivera.

Both were killed instantly by a gunshot wound to his head.

Notably missing from Hunt's testimony was the fact the autopsy determined Garcia was pregnant at the time she was killed. While it was mentioned in the first trial, the new trial did not bring that detail before the jury.

Tuesday, a friend of the defendant took the stand Tuesday in the re-trial for Jose Larin Garcia, the man accused of killing four people in Palm Springs in 2019. The defense tried to show investigators made mistakes in looking into the man they said was responsible for the killings.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vHn0oMsTew

BACKGROUND:

Jose Larin Garcia, a Cathedral City man, is accused of killing four people (ages 17-25): Carlos Campos, Jacob Montgomery, Yuliana Garcia and Juan Duarte Raya nearly four years ago.

Jose Larin Garcia, 23

The four victims were all found shot and killed on the night of February 3rd, 2019.

Three of the victims were found inside a car that crashed at Sunny Dunes and El Placer roads. The fourth victim was discovered in the street on Canon Dr. few blocks away.

When police arrived on scene, they found Larin Garcia hiding under a truck. They say he appeared intoxicated and covered in blood.

Larin Garcia was taken to Desert Regional Medical Center for treatment. Security footage shows him running from the hospital later that night.

Detectives have testified he then went to a friend’s house who he had buy him a one-way bus ticket to Florida using a fake name. Prosecutors say he was preparing to flee – shaving his head and beard to change his appearance. He was arrested waiting at the bus stop.

Larin Garcia is charged with four counts of murder. He also faces a special-circumstance allegation of committing multiple murders, opening him to the death penalty if convicted.

WEEK 2 IN COURT:

The jury heard from a police investigator and a friend of some of the victims.

A hospital nurse who treated Larin Garcia as a trauma patient the night of the murders testified he ran from the emergency department.

A Palm Springs police officer gave testimony key to the defense argument that another man carried out the shootings.

The jury was brought on-location to the scene of the crimes.

WEEK 1 IN COURT:

During opening statements, prosecutor and Deputy District Attorney Samantha Paixao asked the jury to hold Larin Garcia responsible for the four lives she said he stole.https://youtube.com/embed/qTPiv4vZAoc

https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/12/volodymyr-zelenskyys-us-visit-joe-biden,Did Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s Speech Before the U.S. Congress Win Over Kevin McCarthy and Republicans?,"Standing in front of the United States Congress, an impassioned Volodymyr Zelenskyy cut to the chase. “We have artillery. Yes. Thank you,"" he said. “Is it enough? Honestly, not really.” In a powerful signal to Vladimir Putin, Zelenskyy arrived in the U.S. on Wednesday, where he met with President Joe Biden in the White House and delivered an address to Congress. Zelenskyy, dressed in combat boots and his country's fatigues, did not mince words as he described his country “soaked in blood,” with “roaring guns” sounding every hour. Nor, did he shy away from his objective.

“I believe there should be no taboos between us in our alliance,” he said, urging the United States to continue giving aid and weapons. “Ukraine never asked the American soldiers to fight on our land instead of us. I assure you that Ukrainian soldiers can perfectly operate American tanks and planes themselves.”

The trip marked the first time the Ukrainian president has left his country since the Russian president launched an assault on Ukraine 300 days ago in February. While Biden has stressed that he will not allow the United States to be pulled into an active war with Russia, the decision to host Zelenskyy sent a clear message to Russia that the administration’s support for Ukraine has not faded.

“This visit to Washington, your first trip outside Ukraine since February, comes as President Putin is escalating his attacks—his brutal attacks—targeting critical infrastructure to make life as hard as possible for not only innocent Ukrainians but children and young children, and everything from orphanages to schools,” Biden said as he welcomed Zelenskyy on Wednesday. “It’s just outrageous what he’s doing.”

Zelenskyy message to Congress was stark: the war in Ukraine is a fight of good against evil, he said, democracy is on the line. “If your patriots stop the Russian terror against our cities, it will let Ukrainian patriots work to the full to defend our freedom,” the Ukrainian leader told Congress, describing a barbarous assault by Putin. “When Russia cannot reach our cities by its artillery, it tries to destroy them with missile attacks.”

Ahead of Zelenskyy’s arrival, Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said in a statement that the “visit will underscore the United States’ steadfast commitment to supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes, including through the provision of economic, humanitarian, and military assistance.”

But that commitment will likely be on shakier ground come January, when control of the House is passed back to Republicans. Zelenskyy addressed a body that’s gearing up for a significant shift in power. Republican leader Kevin McCarthy warned in October that Ukraine would not be receiving a “blank check” from the United States in a Republican House. And several Republicans have renewed the sentiment since, even calling for an inspector general to review the aid that’s been sent. “It’s high time to stop sending any more money—don’t send another penny to Ukraine,” Kentucky’s Thomas Massie said in November. With aid for Ukraine still popular in the Senate, even among Republicans, it’s unlikely the well will fully dry—but these dynamics could put pressure on future negotiations. US and Ukrainian officials saw Zelenskyy’s visit as an opportunity to win over the incoming Congress.

It is, however, unclear as to whether Zelenskyy managed to change the minds of Republican holdouts. At various times throughout his speech to Congress, Zelenskyy was met with standing ovations, but a few Republican lawmakers stayed seated as the rest of the chamber rose in applause for the Ukraine President. After the speech, some Republicans still expressed hesitancy, many couching their potential opposition to further aid in concerns that there is a lack of accountability as to how U.S. funding is being spent in the war.

“Obviously, there’s concern that the money’s going to the places that it’s intended. Having any taxpayer dollars that go anywhere, whether it’s domestically or abroad, deserves scrutiny,” Republican Steve Scalise, the House Minority Whip, told Politico. “We expressed an interest in making sure the money is going to be scrutinized. That’s something that we still will keep pushing for.”

On Wednesday, Zelenskyy sought to assuage this concern. “Your money is not charity,” he said. “It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.” And despite some pushback, Congress is still looking likely to approve another $45 billion in aid to Ukraine this week as part of the $1.7 trillion federal government funding bill (one that some conservative Republicans have been vocally grumbling about). Should Congress sign off on the latest round of funding, it will bring the total amount of US aid to Ukraine to more than $100 billion. Zelenskyy did walk away with one major victory as Biden pledged $1.8 billion in security assistance, along with missile systems and precision bomb kits.

Zelenksyy’s highly risky trip comes as Putin’s assault on Ukraine will soon stretch into its second year. As he concluded his speech, Zelenskyy presented Vice President Kamala Harris and Pelosi with a Ukrainian flag signed by front-line troops. The Speaker, in turn, presented Zelenskyy with an American flag that had flown over the Capitol that day. Even before the Ukrainian president had left the chamber, praise for his speech flowed across news networks and social media.

But in right-wing circles, a very different message was circulating. On Wednesday night on Fox News, Tucker Carlson took shots at Zelenskyy's attire, saying he looked like a “strip club manager,” and accused the Ukrainian president, who is Jewish, for waging a war against Christianity (seemingly in line with a Kremlin talking point). Donald Trump Jr. called Zelenskyy an “ungrateful international welfare queen.” Notably, however, much of the criticism steered clear of anything truly substantive or what the Ukrainian president said.",Q4
https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/10/01/brown-v-board-of-education-national-historical-park-marks-anniversary/69530771007/,Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park marks 30-year anniversary with symposium,"Three months after the National Park service announced James Williams as the new superintendent of Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Park of Topeka, the site opened its doors in celebration of the 30th anniversary of its designation.

The symposium at the Brown v. Board of Education site, 1515 S.E. Monroe, also welcomed leaders from five new affiliated areas and an additional National Park Service site.

""It's just interesting to me, to get to know the people, get to know their stories and see the potential for us as a agency to help the American people understand the complexity of the Brown decision and all the history that went into it,"" Williams said.

What makes the symposium historic?

This week's symposium is historic because it brought together — for the first time — people from each of the sites that are part of Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park, said Sean Dixon, president of Visit Topeka.

He noted that President Joe Biden last May signed the Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park Expansion and Redesignation Act.

That act continues federal government efforts to recognize the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision, which banned racial segregation in schools in 1954. Lawsuits linked to two schools in South Carolina and one each in Kansas, Virginia, Delaware and the District of Columbia were all consolidated into that case.

Michael Hines, Jonna Perrillo and Zoe Burkholder were guest speakers for the symposium. The professors presented curriculum on school segregation and education equity.

""As a child, I didn't fully understand the impact of it until I started getting older and being able to process more intellectually about this,"" said Ethel Brown Marshall. ""That was when I started understanding the real impact of what this was all about.""

Brown Marshall was an original petition signer on the historic Briggs v. Elliott case. Briggs v. Elliott was one of the lawsuits consolidated into Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision.

Harry Briggs and 20 other parents of Clarendon County, school district one, filed a suit against president of the school board, R.W. Elliott, challenging segregation. Originally, parents asked the county to provide school buses for black students as they did for white students.

Brown Marshall was in the first grade when she signed the petition, and her parents told her, ""This is what we're going to do.""

""You can't deny that we've come a long way,"" she said. ""However, I am really, very concerned now about the ethics of some of the groups in this society who try to rewrite history.""

Brown Marshall said she is worried about the ""business of banning books"" in education today.

""When you can control information,"" she said, ""you control the people, and that's what I'm worried about.""

How did this week's event promote teamwork?

The legislation Biden signed in May redesignated Topeka's Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site, which officially opened in 2004, as Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park.

It added the two school sites in South Carolina to the newly created park while designating the sites in Virginia, Delaware and the District of Columbia as ""affiliated areas.""

Site superintendent Williams said the affiliated areas will remain independent, but the law allows them to enter into cooperative agreements and provide technical assistance and available funding to help them mark, interpret and preserve their stories.

Dixon said the symposium in Topeka will allow organizers to begin planning for the 70th anniversary of the Brown v. Board ruling, which will be in 2024.

https://news.yahoo.com/smart-meter-monitoring-help-conserve-203312300.html,"Smart meter monitoring can help conserve water — but not without a fight, researchers find","The use of smart meters to enforce water restrictions could encourage widespread conservation — but not without local backlash, a new study has found.

Amid California’s ongoing drought, researchers partnered with the city of Fresno in summer 2018 to access and identify water violations via household meter data.

While a resulting surge in fines brought a dramatic reduction in both water use and violations, a barrage of complaints thwarted the program’s survival, according to the study, released on Wednesday by the University of Chicago’s Energy & Environment Lab.

“The urgency of the water challenge in the West requires such highly efficient tools,” co-author Michael Greenstone, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, said in a statement.

Yet policymakers “will need to carefully balance improved monitoring with community expectations and enforcement efforts,” Greenstone acknowledged.

From July-September 2018, Greenstone and his colleagues piloted the automated enforcement of outdoor water restrictions for nearly 100,000 households in Fresno, where a total of 114,508 homes had meters installed at the time.

Even though the city’s utility was a national pioneer in universal smart meter adoption, enforcement largely remained in the hands of “water cops” — workers who look for lawns that are being watered at prohibited hours.

During the three-month pilot program, however, the share of households fined for non-compliance increased from 0.1 percent to 14 percent, according to the study.

The ensuing shifts were drastic: a 17-percent decrease in total infractions and an 8-percent reduction in the number of households violating restrictions each month, the researchers found.

The authors also observed a 3-percent decline in water consumption over the three-month initiative, with households continuing to conserve even after the program concluded.

“The fact that households continued conserving water even after the summer, and even after the policy — and fines — ended, demonstrates that the policy was nudging behavioral changes in some households,” Ludovica Gazze, an assistant professor at the University of Warwick, said in a statement.

Had the policy been scaled-up, Fresno could have saved 394 million gallons of water annually — helping achieve the 20-percent reductions in water use that Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has encouraged statewide, the study determined.

But this long-term program failed to materialize, leading the researchers to conclude that the program may have worked “too well.”

While many residents changed their habits, others were displeased, the authors explained.

During the three-month pilot, the number of households calling the local utility increased by 654 percent, while identifiable customer complaints rose by 1,102 percent, according to the study.

The resultant dissatisfaction ultimately led municipal officials to terminate the program, per the report.

“In practice, the city returned to relying on water cops and in-person inspections,” the authors wrote.

Prior to the program, water infractions “were rampant and punishments were rare,” the authors stressed.

In the summer of 2016, although 68 percent of households violated restrictions at least once, only 0.4 percent of those violations were sanctioned, according to the study.

Despite the monumental gains in conservation that the program achieved, the ensuing “political backlash caused Fresno to reverse its plan to scale automated enforcement of water use regulations citywide,” according to the study.

The city began by issuing a fine moratorium the day after the pilot concluded, the authors noted.

In April 2019, Fresno’s council then voted unanimously to lower maximum penalties from $200 to $100, as well as raise the permitted hours of outdoor water use and relax consumption thresholds, per the study.

The same vote also stipulated that fines could not be imposed based on meter readings — a move that was “effectively disallowing automatic enforcement,” the researchers contended.

“This experience serves as a cautionary tale about the limits of new technologies to solve compliance problems and underscores the need for research to identify the settings where they can succeed,” the authors stated.

The researchers stressed the importance of finding a compromise between political pressures and the integration of such technologies, rather than giving up on them.

“Policymakers should find ways to use this type of real-time data and bring their aging regulations into this century,” co-author Olga Rostapshova, executive director of the Energy & Environment Lab, said in a statement.

“Doing so may require a gradual shift and careful calibration of community expectations,” she added. “We hope to partner with more cities to test out different approaches to find the right balance.”

LAHORE (IANS) – The attack on former Pakistan Prime Minister and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan in Wazirabad on November 3 was launched from three different directions in which at least three individuals were involved, the police said, according to a media report.

The police and eyewitnesses said that the bullets were fired from three different directions. One of the assailants, they said, fired on Khan’s container from the roof of a nearby workshop, Samaa TV reported.

Earlier, it had been claimed that there was only one attacker who was apprehended by a member of the crowd. He was identified as Naveed ‘Thua’ (Punjabi slang for scorpion), the report said.

He confessed to launching the attack unilaterally in a confessional video statement recorded and released by the police.

The police said that they had recovered a 9 mm handgun from the suspect along with four magazines. Another man has been arrested by the Punjab Police for the attack on the PTI chief.

Meanwhile, the Punjab police have said that they are searching for a third person with a search operation launched in the area using sniffer dogs, Samaa TV reported.

The police have sealed the area where the attack took place. They have also cordoned off the PTI container with forensic officials collecting evidence.

Pakistan Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi has taken notice of leaking the suspected attacker’s confessional statement after the gun attack on Khan during the long march in Gujranwala, ARY News reported.

The Chief Minister said in a statement that all mobile phones of the police station’s staffers have been confiscated and they will be sent for forensic audit, the report said.

Khan and other PTI leaders were injured after a man opened fire near the PTI reception camp at Allahwala Chowk during the party’s long march. Khan sustained bullet injuries in his leg and is currently under treatment at the Shaukat Khanum Hospital in Lahore. A party worker or official was killed in the attack while several others were injured.

Protests erupt across Pakistan after attack on Imran Khan

PTI Secretary-General Asad Umar said Imran Khan suspects three people — Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, and a senior military officer — were behind the assassination attempt on him, according to a media report.

“Imran Khan has said that he had the information beforehand that these people might be involved in the assassination attempt on him,” Umar said in a video statement alongside party leader Mian Aslam Iqbal, Geo News reported.

Following the gun attack, protests erupted in different cities across the country against the assassination attempt on Khan. Lahore, Faisalabad and Karachi are reported to have huge gatherings of protestors.

His ex-wife, Jemima Goldsmith, took to social media to praise the young man who foiled the attack on the former Prime Minister during the party’s long march in Gujranwala. She said that Khan’s sons were thankful to the “heroic man” who dealt with the gunman and saved their father’s life, Geo News reported.

She even posted the picture of the young man, Ibtisam, who foiled the assassination attempt on the PTI Chairman. Ibtisam told the press that the gunman was not ready to shoot. He added that the pistol used by the attacker was automatic and continued to fire even after it was taken from him.",Q4

Even though the United States is taking steps to protect the country’s military and tech prowess from Beijing, Washington is not looking to cut off ties with China, according to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.

“We’re not seeking the decoupling from China. We want to promote trade and investment in areas that don’t threaten our core economic and national security interests or compromise human rights values,” Raimondo said while speaking to reporters on Wednesday. For several years, Washington has pursued a policy of engagement with China in hopes that Beijing will open up its economy to foreign competition, she said.

“But China took a different path,” Raimondo said.

China’s leaders have made it “very clear” that they do not intend to implement political and economic reforms or open up. Instead, they are pushing for more integration of state power in the Chinese economy and society, placing restrictions on the free flow of capital and information.

In addition, the Chinese regime is “accelerating” its attempts to fuse its military ambitions with technology and economic policies. As a result, interdependence with China is creating “significant new risks” for America’s national security.

But at the same time, Raimondo rejected the notion that the United States should isolate its economy fully from China. “We need to continue to do business with China … Trade with China supports American jobs.”

In an interview with CNBC in September, the commerce secretary revealed that Washington plans on rallying its allies to raise pressure on China, and that the only way of slowing down the rate of innovation of the nation is by working with Europe.

“They’re ripping off our IP [intellectual property], they are not playing by the rules. It’s not a level playing field. And so we need to hold their feet to the fire to make sure that they do that,” she said. Business of Semiconductors In October, Washington expanded its semiconductor ban on China, which experts believe will speed up America’s decoupling from Beijing.

On Oct. 7, the Department of Commerce set up new export restrictions on advanced chip manufacturing equipment and semiconductors to ensure that American technology is not used for the development of the Chinese military.

In an interview with The Epoch Times, Tsai Ming-fang, an economics professor at Tamkang University in Taipei, said that the new ban is an indication that the trend of decoupling between the two nations is more certain.

“Taiwan factories will no longer help Chinese manufacturers but will help more brands in democratic countries,” he predicted.

The Commerce Department has also issued license restrictions that prevent American citizens from working in China’s chip manufacturing industry. Breaking the rule would risk losing U.S. citizenship. The Biden administration has called on allies to pass similar semiconductor restrictions.

While speaking to CNBC earlier this month, Raimondo said that the new rule is “necessary,” even though it would negatively affect the revenue of some U.S. firms.

“This is targeted. We didn’t do this on day one. We’ve been working on this for a year. It is powerful, but it’s also targeted to get the national security job done and not punish U.S. companies,” she said.

Larry Hogan bans TikTok use in Maryland state government, citing potential cybersecurity risks","Maryland’s executive agencies will be barred from using the popular social media platform TikTok and other “Chinese and Russian-influenced products and platforms” because of cybersecurity risks, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Tuesday.

Hogan, a two-term Republican who will leave office next month, issued the emergency cybersecurity directive after governors in other states made similar moves and FBI director Chris Wray reiterated concerns about the app being a national security threat.

“There may be no greater threat to our personal safety and our national security than the cyber vulnerabilities that support our daily lives,” Hogan said in a statement. “As the cyber capital of America, Maryland has taken bold and decisive actions to prepare for and address cybersecurity threats. To further protect our systems, we are issuing this emergency directive against foreign actors and organizations that seek to weaken and divide us.”

TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company, and Republicans have targeted it in recent years over concerns that the Chinese government can access user data.

Hogan’s directive also prohibits the use of Huawei Technologies, ZTE Corp, Tencent Holdings — which includes products such as Tencent QQ, QQ Wallet and WeChat — and Alibaba products, which includes AliPay and Kaspersky.

It was not immediately clear whether the governor or the executive branch agencies under his domain currently use TikTok or any of the other products.

The order cites a “reasonable belief” of risks associated with the products such as cyber-espionage, government surveillance, “inappropriate collection of sensitive personal information” and “algorithmic modification to conduct disinformation or misinformation campaigns.”

Maryland Gov.-elect Wes Moore, a Democrat, declined to comment through a spokesperson on Hogan’s directive.

South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, both Republicans, also issued orders in the last week to ban TikTok from state government devices. Hogan is raising money for a possible presidential run.",Q4
https://1350kman.com/2022/10/kansas-undersheriff-faces-trial-in-fatal-beanbag-shooting/,Kansas undersheriff faces trial in fatal beanbag shooting,"BELLE PLAINE, Kan. (AP) — Jury selection began Monday in the trial of a Kansas undersheriff in the fatal shooting of an unarmed man with a homemade beanbag round out of his personal shotgun, a case that comes amid a national reckoning on police violence.

Virgil Brewer, who was with the Barber County Sheriff’s Office at the time, is facing a charge of reckless involuntary manslaughter for his deadly encounter with Steven Myers on Oct. 6, 2017. The shooting occurred in Sun City, a rural area about 300 miles (555 kilometers) from Kansas City, Kansas.

A civil lawsuit brought by Myers’ family against Brewer and then-Barber County Sheriff Lonnie Small was settled in 2020 after county officials agreed to pay $3.5 million.

Brewer’s criminal trial is expected to focus on whether his lack of knowledge and training with the less-lethal munitions amounted to a crime.

Defense attorney David Harger did not respond to messages seeking comment on the case. Brewer has been on unpaid leave since his 2018 arrest. He has been free pending trial.

“The fact of the matter is that it is not going to be a good outcome for anybody, no matter whether or not he gets convicted,” Steven Myers’ widow, Kristina Myers, told The Associated Press on Thursday. “Yes, it will be over in that sense, but this one bad decision has ruined the lives of so many people.”

On the evening of Oct. 6, 2017, Brewer was carrying his personal weapon when he, along with the sheriff and a sheriff’s deputy, responded to a call about a man holding a rifle on a street after an altercation at a local bar.

About five minutes before the fatal shooting, Small said: “A little luck and he’ll just pass out and die,” a remark captured on the sheriff’s body camera as they searched for Myers. They eventually found him hiding in a shed.

Both Brewer and the deputy later told the Kansas Bureau of Investigation that they could clearly see that Myers was not armed when they confronted him outside the shed, according to the probable cause affidavit obtained by AP.

Body camera footage reviewed by investigators shows Brewer repeatedly told Myers to “get on the ground” before shooting him outside the shed, while Deputy Mark Suchy gave conflicting commands to “put your hands up now.” Seconds later, Brewer shot Myers with one round.

Brewer told the Kansas Bureau of Investigation during an interview that he feared for his life and those of his deputies when Myers continued to walk toward them, adding he did not expect the beanbag round to penetrate Myers’ chest.

The deputy’s body camera video showed Myers was not making any aggressive movement at the time Brewer shot him, according to Bureau Agent Brian Carroll in an affidavit in support of the criminal charge against the undersheriff.

“Myers was never told he was under arrest, Myers was never warned that his failure to comply with commands would result in the use of the impending force,” Carroll wrote.

Brewer then discharged his personal weapon at too close of a distance and shot Myers in the chest, a lethal force zone, according to the affidavit.

Carroll’s affidavit contends that Brewer’s lack of knowledge and training regarding the proper use of less-lethal beanbag munitions recklessly caused Myer’s death. Proper training would have provided critical information about the proper distance to deploy the round and the proper target zone on a person.

Such training also would have informed Brewer about past problems with rectangular-shaped bean bags like the one he used, Carroll wrote. Those are known to penetrate subjects shot with them, and their use has been discontinued for years. The rounds used today are rounded, balloon-shaped bean bags, according to the affidavit.

Before coming to Kansas, Brewer worked in Texas, where he was given the beanbag ammunition used the evening of Myers’ death. The affidavit revealed that the Kansas Bureau of Investigation interviewed Travis Martin, the deputy at the Freestone County Sheriff’s Office in Texas who gave Brewer the ammunition.

Martin, who is expected to testify, told the agency that after speaking with the beanbag maker, that type of ammunition would no longer be carried and should not be fired on a person.

Martin told investigators that he “thought he had talked with Brewer about not using the ammunition on a person,” according to the affidavit.

Medical Examiner Timothy Gorrill is also expected to take the witness stand. His autopsy found the cause of death to be a penetrating shotgun bag wound to the trunk with the manner of death ruled a homicide.

Kristina Myers said she has been subpoenaed, adding she hopes to be allowed to watch the trial after her testimony.

“It doesn’t bring him back, but it does give us a sense of justice,” she said. “Everyone, no matter their occupation, should be held responsible for their actions. All actions have consequences.”",Q4
https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/supreme-court-case-same-sex-marriage-allow-lgbtq-discrimination-rcna60113,Supreme Court case on same-sex marriage could allow LGBTQ discrimination,"Does a website design company have a First Amendment right to discriminate against same-sex couples? That was essentially the question before the Supreme Court in 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis on Monday. More specifically, the court considered two questions: Do businesses have the right to refuse certain services to same-sex couples, and do they have the right to post a statement on their websites explaining the religious justifications for doing so? The answer to both ought to be no. Unfortunately, the tenor of the oral argument suggests the answers may well be yes, opening the door to widespread discrimination against the LGBTQ community.

303 Creative LLC is a Colorado company that designs websites. Its owner Lorie Smith has her eye on expanding into the wedding market. However, she only wants to design wedding websites for straight couples, on the grounds that same-sex marriage conflicts with God’s will.

Unfortunately, little in Monday’s oral argument suggests that the Supreme Court will rule in Colorado’s favor.

Unfortunately for Smith, to refuse service to members of the public because they are gay is illegal: Colorado bans businesses, shops and other places of public accommodation from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. 303 Creative argues that its First Amendment rights trump Colorado’s antidiscrimination law.

If this case creates a feeling of déjà vu, that’s because the 2018 Masterpiece Cakeshop LTD v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission decision, concerning a bakery’s refusal to create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, also raised free speech and religious liberty claims. But the Supreme Court reached no conclusion on the free speech claim and instead ruled in favor of the bakery on narrow religious grounds.

303 Creative v. Elenis, in contrast, is solely a free speech case. It argues that requiring it to design a wedding website for a same-sex couple forces it to endorse same-sex marriage in violation of the First Amendment’s free speech clause, which states that “Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech.”

Existing constitutional law requires at least two things to be true in order for 303 Creative to win: that providing website services to clients is speech that’s protected by the free speech clause, and that the government can’t articulate a reason that justifies possible infringement on the design company’s free speech rights. (No constitutional right is absolute, so even speech rights may have to yield to a compelling government interest.)

The first requirement may seem straightforward; after all, wedding websites for customers and 303 Creative’s proposed statement for the company’s own website both contain written words, and if written words are not speech, then what is? But this question is in fact complicated. Speech in the colloquial sense does not always match “speech” in the constitutional sense: Sometimes speech is not “speech” but conduct, and therefore not protected by the First Amendment, and sometimes conduct counts as protected “speech.”

For example, an American telling national security secrets to a foreign enemy is speech, but it would be treated as the conduct of treason — which is not protected by the free speech clause. A sign on a restaurant that says “We do not hire Black people” is words, but it would be treated as an act of discrimination that is not protected by the free speech clause, either.

For this reason, the proposed website statement, the second issue, might not be “speech” at all. It depends on the ruling on the first issue. If it turns out that 303 Creative does not have a free speech right to refuse service to same-sex couples, publishing a statement on its website that it will not provide wedding services to gay and lesbian couples could be characterized as discriminatory conduct that triggers no free speech review.

At the same time, conduct may express a message and therefore count as constitutionally protected “speech.” The classic example is burning a draft card. Even though a law that forbids starting fires in public outlaws conduct, because burning a draft card is intended to and understood to express a message — namely opposition to the draft — using the law to prosecute someone who burns a draft card may trigger free speech scrutiny. A law that targets conduct (burning) but also incidentally bans expressive conduct (burning a draft card to protest a war) is much less likely to be unconstitutional than a law that purposely bans speech.

The challenge here is how to classify 303 Creative’s making or refusing to make a website for same-sex couples. Is that pure speech? If so, Colorado’s public accommodations law is unconstitutional unless the government can show that the law is necessary to accomplish a government goal of the utmost importance. Is it pure conduct? If so, it does not trigger, never mind violate, the free speech clause. Or is it akin to expressive conduct, which is afforded some free speech protection but not at the same level as pure speech?

Not surprisingly, 303 Creative argues that the challenged law regulates pure speech. After all, the anti-discrimination law requires that it create a website of words and images. But that’s not a fair characterization of the law.

Colorado’s law actually bars companies that open their doors to the public from refusing to serve people based on certain characteristics like sexual orientation. That’s a regulation of conduct. If the place of public accommodation is a website designer, it might incidentally affect speech, but the law itself is not targeting speech. Consequently, its odds of being constitutional are much higher than if it were pure speech.

But because no constitutional right is absolute, even a pure free speech claim requires that the government cannot justify the challenged law by pointing to a really compelling need for it. In this case, the compelling need is obvious: to end discrimination against gay and lesbian couples in public spaces. This is how the government ensures not only equal access to goods and services but also equal citizenship and equal dignity.

Unfortunately, little in Monday’s oral argument suggests that the Supreme Court will rule in Colorado’s favor. The majority of justices seemed disinclined to see this law as one aimed at conduct. And continuing a trend established by previous cases that allowed Christian store owners and Christian organizations to discriminate against same-sex couples, the conservative justices mostly ignored the state’s interest in making sure its LGBTQ citizens are not treated as second-class citizens. Instead, various justices on the right emphasized Monday how decent people with honorable religious beliefs might oppose same-sex marriage.

The conservative justices mostly ignored the state’s interest in making sure its LGBTQ citizens are not treated as second-class citizens.

This could have sweeping implications that go well beyond wedding websites. If the court finds for 303 Creative, this right to discriminate against gay and lesbian people won’t be limited to those whose religion condemns same-sex marriage. It would extend to companies that oppose it for nonreligious reasons but can argue that providing their speech-based services to same-sex couples compelled them to express a message of support for that marriage. Potentially, any such company hostile to gays or lesbians could argue that taking their picture or printing an invitation or acting as their lawyer or agent or counselor would express approval of homosexuality.

Nor will this right to discriminate necessarily be limited to the LGBTQ community. As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson suggested at the oral arguments, the argument is little different from the owners of malls claiming a free speech right to limit its Santa photos to white children if multiracial photos clash with their convictions.

If so, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor highlighted, it would be the first time the Supreme Court concluded that a commercial business open to the public could refuse service to someone based on their race, sex, religion or, as here, sexual orientation.",Q4

The U.S. House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol released 34 transcripts this week that they compiled throughout their investigation, including interviews with three Michigan Republican leaders tied to former President Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election.

The committee released transcripts of testimony from Ryan Kelley, former GOP gubernatorial candidate and far-right activist; Kathy Berden, the national committeewoman of the Michigan Republican Party; and Mayra Rodriguez, the Grosse Pointe Farms chair for the 14th District Republican Committee.

On Monday, the bipartisan committee unanimously voted to refer former Trump and others to the Justice Department for potential criminal charges, including inciting or aiding an insurrection.

Along with the indictment, the committee released a 154-page executive summary which states “the central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed. None of the events of January 6th would have happened without him.”

Kelley, who was arrested in June on misdemeanor charges of participating in the Capitol riot, including a count of damaging federal property, told the investigative counsel that “99%” of the events on Jan. 6 were “peaceful.”

“There was some people that busted out windows in the Capitol, and that’s absolutely not right to do. You know, there was some people that fought with police officers, and that’s not the right thing to do. Majority of people that were there, myself included, did not fight with any law enforcement officers, didn’t do any damage to the property, grounds, windows, you know? And so most of the people that were there, myself included, operated themselves under the First Amendment peacefully,” Kelley said.

Kelley, who finished fourth in the five-way Aug. 2 GOP primary, was charged for damaging federal property and tearing down sheets on the inaugural stage that was set up outside of the Capitol that people used to climb into the building.

However, Kelley did not confirm whether he was in any of the videos at the Capitol provided by the investigators.

When asked if he wanted to use any privileges to avoid answering the question, like pleading the Fifth Amendment, Kelley was confused but attempted to plead the Fifth.

When the investigator asked Kelley on what basis he was asserting the Fifth Amendment, Kelley said “the first amendment, the right to peacefully assemble.”

After more back and forth between the investigator, Kelley said he “elects not to identify himself” in any videos and then offered the Fifth Amendment as a privilege again.

“Just so we understand, you’re asserting the Fifth Amendment to refuse to respond to a question asking you to identify if somebody in a video is you, because that answer would tend to incriminate you?” the investigator asked.

“No, not incriminate. To bring infamous bad reputation,” Kelley answered.

Because he never actually pled the Fifth and didn’t give an answer to questions seeking to identify Kelley in videos, the counsel said they would leave the record open on Kelley’s deposition while the committee “considers how to handle the refusal to answer those questions.”

Kelley did not respond to a request for comment from the Michigan Advance.

In the deposition, Kelley was asked about rallies hosted by his organization, the American Patriot Council (APC); his relationship with militias in Michigan; several social media posts he made that referenced violence or calls to action with reference to the Second Amendment; and his experience at the Capitol on Jan. 6.

Kelley and Jason Howland, who was with Kelley in Washington, D.C., on the day of the insurrection, are the co-founders of the far-right group the American Patriot Council. They hosted a number of rallies in Grand Rapids and Lansing protesting Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s COVID-19 orders and the 2020 election results.

The investigators also asked Kelley about a June 26, 2020 post that Howland wrote on Parler, a right-wing social media site. Howland wrote: “Traitors should be tried as such. The penalty is 5 years minimum and $10k fines, all the way up to death. People like [Washington Gov. Jay] Inslee in Washington should see the gallows.”

Kelley responded to the post: “It is our responsibility as Patriots to make sure the constitution [sic] stays number one.”

The investigators also referenced a post from June 28, where Howland wrote: “Real question: would gallows being built in town squares around the country and a serious willingness to use them put an end to some of this treason we are seeing?”

Kelley responded: “That’s a great question! How they used to do it!”

When asked about its violent connotations, Kelley said that the post about gallows “was an opinion” of Howland.

The investigators also asked about a tweet in which someone from the APC Twitter account wrote: “On January 6th, we strengthen the American Republic, renew the spirit of America, and inspire millions to continue the never-ending fight for freedom. Be in DC.”

Kelley said he does not believe he wrote that tweet and said he is unaware of the number of people who have access to post on the APC Twitter account.

When asked if Kelley was with Howland in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021, Kelley initially said he “saw him there.” Later, he revealed that they traveled to D.C. together.

The investigators asked about another Parler post from Oct. 6, 2020, where Kelley wrote: “more Militia needed nationwide ready to step up & fight for America.”

When asked why he specifically called on militia members, Kelley said he had “no specific answer on that” and it was “not a call for violence.”

Kelley said he still has questions about the validity of the 2020 presidential election. President Joe Biden beat Trump in Michigan by more than 154,000 votes, and more than 250 state and local audits have disproven claims of election fraud.

The others who were subpoenaed by the committee to give testimony, Rodriguez and Berden, mostly relied on the Fifth Amendment to avoid answering questions.

Rodriguez and Berden are two of Michigan’s 16 fake electors who in December 2020 signed a certificate falsely claiming Trump won the state’s presidential election. Others included Michigan GOP Co-Chair Meshawn Maddock and Shelby Township Clerk Stan Grot.

The false electors submitted it to the U.S. Senate and the National Archives to cast the state’s electoral votes for Trump. Berden was listed as the chairwoman for the Michigan electors meeting and Rodriguez was listed as the secretary. Both were subpoenaed by the committee in January.

The two false electors were asked about a meeting that was held on Dec. 14, 2020, in the basement of the Michigan GOP headquarters in Lansing, but both denied to offer up any details.

Berden and Rodriguez were asked about who was at the meeting; what they were told about the document they signed; and what out of state players they were in communication with — like Trump attorney Rudy Guiliani or Kenneth Chesebro, another Trump attorney who wrote a memo putting forward a proposal for having false slates of Trump electors in a number of states.

The line of questioning was not fruitful, as the two witnesses relied on the Fifth Amendment over 100 times between the two of them.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/20/elon-musk-reinstates-donald-trumps-twitter-account,Elon Musk reinstates Donald Trump’s Twitter account,"Trump’s account reappeared on Twitter after a poll run by Elon Musk showed narrow support for his reinstatement.

Elon Musk has reinstated Donald Trump’s account on Twitter, nearly two years after the former United States president was banned from the social media platform for inciting violence.

Trump’s account reappeared on Twitter on Saturday after Musk, the platform’s new owner, ran a poll on the social media site that showed narrow support for allowing Trump to return.

More than 15 million people voted in the poll asking whether Trump’s account should be reinstated, with a slim majority of 51.8 percent voting in favour.

“The people have spoken. Trump will be reinstated,” Musk tweeted.

But Trump said earlier on Saturday that he had no interest in returning to the platform.

“I don’t see any reason for it,” the former president said via video when asked whether he planned to return to Twitter by a panel at the Republican Jewish Coalition’s annual leadership meeting.

The people have spoken. Trump will be reinstated. Vox Populi, Vox Dei. https://t.co/jmkhFuyfkv — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 20, 2022

Trump said he would stick with his new platform Truth Social, the app developed by his Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) start-up, which he said had better user engagement than Twitter and was doing “phenomenally well”.

Trump, who on Tuesday launched a bid to regain the White House in 2024, also praised Musk and said he had always liked him.

But the former president also said Twitter suffered from bots, fake accounts and that the problems it faced were “incredible”.

Musk first said in May he planned to reverse the ban on Trump, and the timing of any return by the former president was closely watched — and feared — by many of Twitter’s advertisers.

Musk has since sought to reassure users and advertisers that such a decision would be made with consideration by a content moderation council composed of people with “widely diverse viewpoints”, and no account reinstatements would happen before the council convened.

He also said Twitter would not reinstate any banned users until there was a “clear process for doing so”.

This week, Musk reinstated comedian Kathy Griffin, who had been banned for changing her profile name to “Elon Musk”, which violated his new rule against impersonation without indicating it was a parody account.

There has been no new information about the process for reinstatement or the moderation council.

If Trump does not return to Twitter, it could reduce concerns among major advertisers, who are already rattled by Musk’s drastic reshaping of the platform.

He has halved the workforce and severely cut the company’s trust and safety team, which is responsible for preventing the spread of misinformation and harmful content.

These actions and Musk’s tweeting have pushed big companies to halt advertising on the site as they monitor how the platform handles hate speech.

https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/activists-hold-rally-outside-ice-office-in-phoenix-to-call-for-better-treatment-of-migrants,Activists hold rally outside ICE office in Phoenix to call for better treatment of migrants,"People gathered outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office in Phoenix on the night of Oct. 13 to demand better treatment of migrants.

The event was hosted by the Arizona Jews for Justice Campaign, and the rally began at around 7:30 p.m., and the event took place as the number of people entering the U.S. illegally is reaching historic levels.

The number of migrant arrivals reported along the U.S.-Mexico border in the 2022 fiscal year surpassed 2 million in August, marking an all-time high. In 2021, there was around 1.7 million, and in 2020, the level was around 450,000.

Organizers of the event say their goal is to raise awareness and call for better treatment of migrants and asylum seekers. Specifically, they want authorities to stop the practice of bussing migrants to what they say are the wrong locations.

Since May 2022, Gov. Doug Ducey has been bussing migrants who came to the U.S. from the country's border with Mexico in Arizona to Washington, D.C., in an effort to try and provide relief for overwhelmed border communities. Many people, however, believe the move is more political, after he continues to bash President Joe Biden for not doing more.

So far, more than 2,000 people were *voluntarily transported, and Gov. Ducey plans on bussing migrants until he leaves office in 2023. Arizona, along with two other states, are sending migrants (specifically asylum seekers) throughout the country.

""We are sending people to New York who need to be in Virginia, with the aspect of them saying 'well, we are sending them to the East Coast.' Yes, but with what resources? Are you ensuring that they get to their families? Are you making sure they meet their ICE court date? Let’s talk after that. You know we should step back and let the nonprofits that are working here do what they’re good at,"" said Eddie Chavez Calderon, Campaign Director with Arizona Jews For Justice.

The group is also drawing attention to religious freedom, saying Border Patrol agents in Arizona confiscated the turbans of dozens of Sikh men looking for asylum after they were detained.

In a statement, officials with CBP say they ""take allegations of this nature very seriously.""

""This issue was raised in June, and steps were immediately taken to address the situation. Our expectation is that CBP employees treat all migrants we encounter with respect. An internal investigation has been opened to address this matter,"" read a portion of CBP's statement.",Q4

Luke Ingram, 19, was accused of killing one family member and injuring another in a Palm Coast home while he visited from Georgia on Nov. 9. Originally, the most serious charge he faced was second-degree murder.

But on Monday, a Flagler County grand jury indicted Ingram on charges of first-degree murder and sexual battery deadly weapon/force.

“Ingram is believed to have sexually battered the elderly relative … ,” according to a press release Tuesday from the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office.

The relative died of blunt-force trauma and manual strangulation, according to the release.

Ingram was also charged with domestic battery by strangulation; aggravated battery on a law enforcement officer; resisting an officer with violence; and resisting an officer without violence.

The press release does not identify the relatives whom Ingram was visiting from Georgia where he attended college.

What happened November 9?

Luke Ingram's father, Clint Ingram, 48, described his son as schizophrenic, according to a charging affidavit. Clint Ingram said his son had been acting strangely so he invited him to visit on Nov. 8.

But later that night, things turned violent.

The charging affidavit states that Clint Ingram, 48, went to a neighbor’s house just before 3 a.m. on Nov. 9 saying he needed help because his son had attacked him. Clint Ingram’s face and clothing were stained with blood.

Clint Ingram also told the neighbor that his father, Darwin Ingram, 85, needed help and was bleeding back at their house on Clermont Court, the affidavit stated.

“My son attacked me, I need help,” Clint Ingram is quoted saying in the affidavit. “Call the ambulance, my dad is on the floor.”

Deputies arrived and found Luke Ingram in the living room standing next to the victim's bloodied body on the floor, according to the affidavit.

Luke Ingram was arrested after refusing orders and struggling with deputies, the affidavit stated.

He was taken to the State Attorney’s Office at the Kim C. Hammond Justice Center in Bunnell. He was placed in an interview room where he was staring and not responding to most questions, the affidavit stated. No questions were asked about the incident, the affidavit stated.

'Who did I kill?'

Detectives obtained a search warrant and were in the process of taking DNA samples, blood swabs and a blood test from Luke Ingram when the teen asked “Who did I kill” and “Who did I almost kill,” the affidavit stated.

Luke Ingram then tried to flee and struggled with deputies despite being handcuffed, the affidavit stated. He bit and tried to bite law enforcement officers, the affidavit stated.

https://patriotpost.us/articles/101441-youngkin-picks-a-good-fight-on-evs-2023-10-20,Douglas Andrews: Youngkin Picks a Good Fight on EVs,"If you love your gas-powered car and hate being told what to do, you might want to root hard for Glenn Youngkin and his fellow Virginia Republicans come Tuesday, November 7.

Youngkin, the energetic, optimistic, and intuitively attuned former Carlyle Group CEO and current Old Dominion governor, rode a wave of righteous school-board rage into office two years ago in a reliably blue state that Joe Biden had carried by double digits. And he’s been working hard and picking great fights ever since.

Youngkin isn’t technically on the ballot in 18 days, but his ideas certainly are. And when it comes to ideas, there’s perhaps none bigger or more consequential than whether Virginia will take its marching orders from California when it comes to banning gas-powered vehicles.

Two years ago, as The Wall Street Journal reports, Democrats in Virginia’s General Assembly made some mischief on their way out the door by passing a law to adopt California’s ruinous and pipe-dreamy vehicle-emissions standards. The bill was signed by outgoing Democrat Governor Ralph Northam, and it essentially “lets progressive regulators on the California Air Resources Board (CARB) dictate the kinds of cars Virginians can drive.”

Those cars, of course, are electric ones — the same electric ones that you’ve been told by the likes of Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg and Gavin Newsom are great for the environment and don’t cost a thing to drive, both of which are lies from the pits of hell.

As we noted a year ago, we don’t have a problem with EVs necessarily, but we do have a problem with the government picking winners and losers. And we think the American people deserve to hear the pros and the cons about the future of individual transportation, and they deserve to be able to make a fully informed decision about it. Otherwise, it’s a rigged game.

Youngkin is betting that his state’s citizens — at least its freedom-loving ones — would prefer to retain their sovereignty over the disastrously governed blue monstrosity on the country’s left coast, and the people of Virginia will have their say on this matter on election day. As the Journal continues:

Under the federal Clean Air Act, California is allowed to set its own standards for tailpipe pollutants, which other states may follow. The Environmental Protection Agency under Presidents Obama and Biden has interpreted this authority broadly, and last year CARB declared sales of new internal-combustion engine cars would be banned in the Golden State by 2035. EVs must make up 35% of auto makers’ sales by 2026 and 68% by 2030. Under Mr. Northam’s law, Virginia is obligated to follow its mandates.

Or not. Earlier this year, Virginia’s House of Delegates passed a bill repealing Northam’s EV monkey-see, monkey-dooism, but a single Democrat state senator blocked it from getting out of his committee. If Youngkin and his fellow Republicans can get out the vote on November 7, they can overtake the Democrats’ narrow majority in the state Senate and clear the way for repeal of the EV mandate. So those are the stakes.

No doubt sensing that Youngkin is on the winning side of this and other issues, Virginia’s Democrats are trying to make the upcoming election about the one issue they’ve been able to demagogue and win on: abortion. Seeking to strike the right balance in a normally blue state, Youngkin has proposed a 15-week ban on the procedure — a ban that Democrats are calling “extreme.”

“Yet,” as the Journal asks, “how is it not extreme to outlaw sales of the gas cars that 99.5% of Virginians still drive?”

If the state’s voters agree, if they reject the California EV mandate next month, Youngkin and his fellow Virginians will have put forth a blueprint for other sensible states to follow.",Q4

It’s a quiet midterm election in Richmond this election year. There’s no competitive congressional race in the region, with the competitive suburban 7th District shifted to Northern Virginia and replaced with the 1st District and its MAGA-curious incumbent Rep. Rob Wittman (R).

Barring a black swan event, Wittman looks to be cruising to reelection. What, then, are the suburban Richmond voters who just two years ago reelected Democrat Abigail Spanberger getting in their new representative?

As I wrote in July, Wittman’s strategy for winning the redrawn 1st District has been to hope that the same suburban voters who formed Spanberger’s base don’t know much, if anything, about his record.

One part of his record — the election denialist portion, that is — got even weirder with the recent House vote on the Electoral Count Act.

The bill’s broad purpose was to prevent a repeat of the insurrectionist assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Bill co-sponsor Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) framed the vote on the bill this way, as reported by the New York Times:

If your aim is to prevent future efforts to steal elections, I would respectfully request that conservatives should support this bill,” she said on the House floor. “If instead your aim is to leave open the door for elections to be stolen in the future, you might decide not to support this or any other bill to address the Electoral Count Act.”

Wittman, like the other three GOP members of Virginia’s House delegation and most of the Republican caucus, voted against it.

That’s in keeping with Wittman’s other instances of election denialism. The Republican Accountability Project gave Wittman an “F” when it comes to democracy, noting his support for the cockamamie Texas amicus brief challenging the legitimacy of presidential electors in four states, objecting to Pennsylvania’s slate of electors and so on.

But let’s add more context to this. Consider Wittman’s explanation for why he objected to the Pennsylvania electors — hours after the rioters stormed the Capitol Building. It supports the notion that Wittman’s actions, in part, stem from old-fashioned self-preservation….

http://www.ecns.cn/news/cns-wire/2022-10-02/detail-ihcepfvq8476112.shtml,"(W.E. Talk) Why is Xinjiang's Prosperity and Development the most Powerful Counterattack to the U.S. Political Conspiracy of ""Containing China through Disrupting Xinjiang""?","By Wang Hongli

On 23 December 2021, the United States signed into law the so-called ""Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act"", which bans the import of all products from Xinjiang into the United States, on the pretext of ""forced labor"" under the guise of human rights.

This ""Act"" is one of a growing number of U.S. bills relating to China and Xinjiang. It is another realistic example of U.S. hegemony and power politics, and another concrete action by the U.S. to regard China as a strategic competitor and to restrain it from rise

The truth is always a ""shredder"" for lies. In fact, Xinjiang has always adhered to the people-centered development ideology and has been promoting the people-benefiting projects on employment, healthcare and education, so that the fruits of the development can better benefit its people. A stable and peaceful society, a flourishing economy and a constant improvement in people's lives can be seen from the north to the south of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang.

Long-arm jurisdiction is a consistent bullying tactic of the United States.

The United States has used sanctions. By taking the advantage of its financial hegemony and technological superiority, it has frequently used ""democracy"", ""human rights"" and ""national security"" as pretexts to override its own domestic laws over international laws, and to arbitrarily sanction and suppress countries that it considers enemies or rivals. Due to the long-term sanctions against other countries, the U.S. has already formed a systematic and complete sanction system and has accumulated rich experience in sanctions.

The U.S. often uses three means -finance, technology and laws - to suppress its competitors in order to maintain its status of economic hegemony, political hegemony and world dominance. In terms of financial means, the U.S. has put relevant companies on the sanction list, excluding them from the ""dollar settlement system"". For technical means, the U.S. has implemented export control bans, curbed the lifelines of enterprises, and controlled military, technology and U.S. dollars as the leading global hegemon. Legally, it overrides international laws. By following its domestic legal procedures, the U.S. uses different combinations of policy tools such as long-arm jurisdiction and entity lists, and eventually develops the approach of using legalized recourses such as ""national security"", ""human rights"", and ""anti-corruption"" issues. The subjectivity, arbitrariness and political nature of these dispositions are obvious, and the ""supremacy of American interests"" is undeniable. These are merely tools of the U.S. for reinforcing its hegemonic position and suppressing any potential competition and surpassing.

The U.S. sanctions are too numerous to list. In his 2019 book of Le Piége Américain (The American Trap), Frédéric Pierucci, a former executive of the French Alstom Group, has pointed out: “Since 2008, 26 companies have been fined more than U.S.$100 million by the United States, of which 14 are European companies (five are French) and only five are U.S. companies. The total fines paid by European companies to date have approximately exceeded U.S.$6 billion, with French companies alone paying nearly $2 billion. Besides, six corporate executives were prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice, of whom I am one.""

The political conspiracy of “containing China through Disrupting Xinjiang"" is clearly evident.

In recent years, the United States has continuously been creating the so-called Xinjiang issues, with which it smears China's human rights situation and attacks China's Xinjiang policy. The intention is to undermine the tremendous achievements in China’s anti-secession, anti-violence, anti-terrorism and de-radicalization in Xinjiang, and destroy the stability and harmony of Xinjiang and the happy lives of people living in Xinjiang. The ultimate goal is to suppress the rise of China. The political aims of the United States are clear, and sanctions are various. This is the case when the so-called ""Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act"", which is just one of many anti-China bills related to Xinjiang, was signed into law.

According to incomplete statistics for 2021 alone, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has issued seven suspension orders for goods involving ""forced labor"", which include cotton products such as clothing and textiles produced in Xinjiang, tomato seeds, canned tomatoes, tomato sauce and its tomato products, silicon-based products, and electronic products. A total value of about U.S.$485 million in goods are detained and confiscated, and imports of cotton, tomatoes, photovoltaics and other leading products from Xinjiang were unjustifiably prohibited into the U.S.. The United States signed the ""Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act"" into law and arbitrarily decided that all goods produced in Xinjiang involve “forced labor”. It declared to ""use all powers the U.S. government has"", including bilateral and multilateral mechanisms, visa and financial sanctions, export restrictions and import controls, in order to ""lead the international community in ending the practice of forced labor"".

It is an overall crackdown to enterprises and commodities in Xinjiang. It is a naked deprivation of Xinjiang people’s rights to pursue a better life through work and employment. It is an attempt to stifle the survival and development of Xinjiang enterprises. It is a usual trick of trying to mess up other countries and then get out of the way. The plot of “containing China through disrupting Xinjiang” is so evident that nothing needs to be covered up.

The prosperity and development of Xinjiang is the most powerful response.

People's well-being is the greatest human right. Each year, Xinjiang spends more than 70% of its general budget expenditure on safeguarding and improving people's livelihood. In 2021, the regional GDP of Xinjiang has increased by 7%, achieving 1.6 trillion yuan (RMB, the same below). The per capita disposable income of urban and rural residents has increased by 8% and 10.8% respectively. The income and welfare of people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are greatly improved, and the income structure has been constantly optimized.

Xinjiang has always regarded the wishes of workers as an important foundation for formulating employment policies, expanding employment channels, exploring employment positions, conducting employment training, and providing employment services. It ensures that the majority of workers can freely choose the form of work, and that employment in society is stable. In the past five years, a total of 2,348,600 new jobs have been created in cities and towns in Xinjiang, and 14,333,000 rural laborers have been employed, bringing the total number of people employed to over 13 million.

The fundamental public services such as education, medical care, culture, and social security in Xinjiang have been significantly enhanced, and the ecological environment has been increasingly improved. Xinjiang has built a medical and health service network covering both urban and rural areas, and the rate of health centers in towns and clinics in villages has reached 100%. Since 2016, the government has invested a total of RMB 8.18 billion in physical examinations, and both urban and rural residents can enjoy free medical examinations each year. The nine-year compulsory education has been achieved in all areas of Xinjiang, and the four prefectures in southern Xinjiang have been covered by 15 years of free education. Xinjiang has established a comprehensive, fundamental, and multi-level social security system. A national insurance scheme was implemented, and the participation rate of urban and rural residents in the basic endowment insurance was stabilized at 95%.

In contrast, how absurd is the U.S. strategic conspiracy to create the so-called Xinjiang issues and human rights issues! How ridiculous it is to ""mess up China and contain it for a long time""! How can the people in Xinjiang pay any attention to the ""noises"" made by the United States?

The development and achievements of Xinjiang are universally recognized, and all can see that people in Xinjiang are living and working in peace and contentment. The tremendous economic and social development of Xinjiang and the peaceful, prosperous, and happy lives of Xinjiang people are the most powerful counterattack to the U.S. hegemony.",Q4

On Friday, Bryan Kohberger, 28, was arrested at his family’s home in Pennsylvania and charged with four counts of first-degree murder and felony burglary in the Nov. 13, deaths of Kaylee Goncalves, 21, of Rathdrum, Idaho, Madison Mogen, 21, of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho; Xana Kernodle, 20, of Post Falls, Idaho; and Ethan Chapin, 20, of Mount Vernon, Washington, according to CNN,

What’s unclear even after the arrest is how Kohberger, a Ph. D. student at Washington State University in Pullman Washington, which is about nine miles from Moscow, knew the victims.

Fry said Friday that information about that connection will emerge “later,” per Newsweek.

“You know, that’s part of that investigation that we’re still putting pieces together. We’re still gathering information,” Fry said, according to Fox News.

“That’s why we’ve still asked people, you know, send us tips on the individual, send us any information you have because that’s all going to be part of that picture. Still, it’s going to give us even more information,” he added.

According to a report from ABC, parent Steve Goncalves, whose daughter, Kaylee was one of the victims, said the suspect is not known to the family, but said there are possible connections he did not wish to speak about.

“Now that there’s a person and a name that someone can specifically look for and see if there’s any connections in any way. So they’re just trying to figure it out,” Shanon Grey, an attorney for the Goncalves family, said.

Goncalves told ABC he will be at the hearing that takes place in Idaho after the suspect is extradited.

“This guy’s gonna have to look me in my eyes multiples times, and I’m going to be looking for the truth. That’s really what I’m going to be looking for,” he said.

Although Fry said police found a white Hyundai Elantra for which they had been searching at the home of Kohberger’s parents, he said police are still seeking the murder weapon, which they believe was a fixed-blade knife, according to Fox News.

Fry said more than 400 calls were made to the tip line set up for the case after Kohberger’s arrest was announced.

Fry said as the case moves toward an eventual prosecution, there is more work to do.

Newsweek notes that he said, “This was a very complex and extensive case. The work is not done, it’s just started.”

He noted that police will only issue details to the extent they will not impact prosecuting the suspect.

“Providing any details in this criminal investigation might have tainted the upcoming criminal prosecution or alerted the suspect of our progress. We will continue to provide as much information as we can as the process moves forward,” he said.

But, according to fire safety experts, it's not that simple.

The Navy says it's using the most effective suppressant to quickly extinguish fuel fires that may occur at the Red Hill facility to protect military personnel.

""It's not something where you can just turn it off because at the same time you have the jet fuel in there so you have to have something readily available in the event of an emergency -- in this case fire,"" said fire protection specialist Rudy Tulonghari. ""So until you find the alternative material -- the alternative suppressant -- I think not having something is worse than, you know, at least having some kind of protection.""

The hazardous chemicals -- known as PFAS -- are in the firefighting system that would need to be cleaned out or entirely replaced to prevent cross-contamination if an alternative were to be used.

The Pentagon is expected to announce new requirements in January for firefighting foams without the toxic chemicals for the military.

""These forever chemicals ... are risks to our water resources,"" said Ernie Lau, chief engineer at the Honolulu Board of Water Supply. ""If they must use this -- these foam systems -- then they should select products that ... are not placing our environment at risk.""

But for now, the Navy is racing to clean up about 1,100 gallons of the hazardous suppressant before it seeps further into the soil and into the groundwater. As of midday, the Navy says it's removed more than 85% of the contaminated soil at Red Hill.

The so-called 'forever chemicals' that can build up in the body are in common consumer products such as non-stick pans and food wrappers, shampoos and dental floss. The fear is that over time it can cause life-threatening illnesses and cancer.",Q4
https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2022/dec/04/the-president-speaks/,The president speaks,"



""End of quote. Repeat the line.""

--Joe Biden, reading from a teleprompter earlier this year

We've heard this line of argument before, but not usually from somebody in the president's position. It goes like this: We don't want to take away anybody's hunting gun. We just want to get rid of semi-automatic weapons.

At that point, many in the pro-Second Amendment crowd stop listening. Because the speaker has just proven himself ignorant. Not stupid, just ignorant of the mechanics of most hunting guns.

Which is what President Biden proved the other day:

""The idea [that] we still allow semi-automatic weapons to be purchased is sick. Just sick. It has no, no social redeeming value. Zero. None. Not a single solitary rationale for it except profit for the gun manufacturers.""

Oy.

To sum up: Automatic weapons are the ones in which you pull the trigger once, and hold, and the blasted thing fires every shell it can hold. And they are so completely regulated that we don't know a soul who owns one. Or who will admit it to us.

But semi-automatic weapons are the ones that load a shell after each shot, and the user must pull the trigger each time he wants to fire a bullet from the thing. These machines are used in deer hunting, turkey hunting, duck hunting, dove hunting, pig hunting, squirrel hunting, and maybe snipe hunting for all we know.

It's not ""just sick"" to own one. Most folks we know don't go duck hunting with a single-shot .410.

These guns have no social redeeming value, zero, none? Except for those who hunt regularly.

But we'll do something rare for this column, and assume that the president of the United States misspoke. Again. Or was confused. Again. Or went off-script, again, and his people will have to walk it back, again. (But it's hard to do that, considering this is the man who once advised somebody fearful for her safety to walk outside her front door and shoot a 12-gauge blast into the sky.)

Maybe the president meant to say ""automatic"" weapons. But those things aren't the preferred weapons of choice for most mass shooters--because they are so hard to come by.

Maybe the president meant to say ""AR-15s,"" in which case he'd have more support for his position. Except that those things do have redeeming value to certain hunters. From what we're told, they come in handy in shooting feral pigs, which gather in groups of a dozen or more, and wipe out acres of rural Arkansas each night.

We will stipulate that not all owners of these M-16 lookalikes hunt feral hogs. (Rural homeowners wish they would!) Many of these gun owners, perhaps most of them, like the AR-15 molds because they ""look cool."" But why call these target-shooters sick?

Questioned again by the press, the president said he would take steps in the coming congressional session to ban certain guns. From the White House's official transcript:

Q: Can you do anything about gun laws during the lame duck, sir?

THE PRESIDENT: I'm going to try.

Q: What will you try and do?

THE PRESIDENT: I'm going to try to get rid of assault weapons.

Q: During the lame duck?

THE PRESIDENT: I'm going to do it whenever I--I got to make that assessment as I get in and start counting the votes.

Once again, from the top, for the president's benefit, if everybody reading already knows this: An assault weapons ban passed in the 1990s. But the ban was allowed to lapse because it wasn't effective. Because the only real difference between an ""assault rifle"" and your pawpaw's deer gun is appearance. And magazine size, but magazines aren't weapons. (If you want a debate on ridding the country of magazines that hold dozens of shells or more, you might be surprised to know how many pro-gun people would agree with you, even here.)

The things that are categorized as ""assault weapons"" shoot not a bit faster than a deer rifle. In fact, most deer rifles are much more powerful. Another ban on these ""assault weapons"" wouldn't work a bit better than a ban did in the 1990s. Especially since there are so many on the streets today, which legislation is sure to grandfather as legal. All previous legislation has.

None of this is to say that nothing can be done. Red-flag laws should be universal, in every American jurisdiction. With protections for due process.

All loopholes to background checks should be closed. Many guns go and come across the southern border, so improving that would help matters. Bump stocks are just a way to get around laws against machine guns, and should be outlawed in every precinct.

And as Dr. Charles Krauthammer once noted, he was allowed to admit patients with mental conditions to hospitals without their signatures in the 1970s, but now too many with those problems are allowed to die with their rights on. And, we'd add, kill.

We can also debate magazine size, gun shows, and other arguments.

But if we're going to have this debate--and we'd damn sure better--everybody needs to understand the definitions.

Former Louisville Metro Police Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly, who was shot in the thigh by Walker as police burst through the door the night of the raid at Taylor's apartment in 2020, confirmed the settlement to The Courier Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network, and said he and the other individual officers named in two civil lawsuits were released from having to pay.

Frederick Moore, an attorney representing Walker, couldn't confirm the settlement or comment on the specifics of Monday's federal court mediation until ""details have been finalized."" City officials haven't yet responded to The Courier Journal's request for more information.

Joey Klausing, an attorney representing former Louisville Detective Kelly Goodlett, said his client was released from the lawsuit Monday with no payment requirement. Goodlett in August pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights charge for her role in falsifying information used to obtain the search warrant on Taylor's apartment.

Walker and Taylor, a 26-year-old unarmed Black woman, were asleep in her South End apartment on March 13, 2020 when Louisville officers attempted to serve a search warrant as part of a narcotics investigation. Walker, who has said he thought an intruder was breaking in, fired a single shot that hit Mattingly. Taylor was shot to death when police returned fire.

The shooting touched off protests in Louisville and across the country in 2020 over the killings of unarmed Black people and demands for police reform.

'This is about justice': Events, rallies mark 1-year anniversary of Breonna Taylor's death

In September 2020, Walker filed civil lawsuits in both state and federal court seeking punitive and compensatory damages against the city and several officers involved with the raid. It's not yet clear if the settlement also satisfies the lawsuit filed in state court.

Walker claims his rights were violated when officers obtained and approved the ""materially false"" search warrant, failed to announce before they entered Taylor's apartment and used excessive and unreasonable force. He also claims Louisville police's policies, customs and practices led to these violations.

Walker was charged with assault and attempted murder of a police officer in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, but those charges were dismissed permanently in March 2021.

Walker's civil suits named Goodlett, former detective Joshua Jaynes and former Sgt. Kyle Meany for their purported role in falsifying and covering up the bad information used to obtain the warrant. All three were charged with federal civil rights violations in August.

IN DEPTH ON NO-KNOCK WARRANTS:Two years after Breonna Taylor's death, federal charges show how to end police violence

Goodlett resigned from the department following the indictment. She admitted in her plea to falsely claiming a postal inspector verified Taylor was receiving packages for her ex-boyfriend, convicted drug dealer Jamarcus Glover, at her apartment before the raid. Glover was the subject of the narcotics investigation that resulted in Taylor's death. Goodlett told investigators she met with Jaynes in his garage so they could ""get on the same page"" after a postal inspector said the claim was bogus, and Meany allegedly had knowledge of the false claim.

Also named in Walker's lawsuits are former officers Myles Cosgrove, who shot at Taylor 16 times and was fired by Louisville police for failing to identify a target, Brett Hankison, whose return gunfire went into Taylor's neighbor's apartments, and Mattingly, who also returned fire at Walker. Hankison also faces federal charges for violating the civil rights of Taylor, Walker and three of Taylor's neighbors.",Q4
https://www.utm.edu/news/2022/12/16/fourth-class-of-west-tennessee-teachers-graduates-from-westteach/,Fourth class of West Tennessee teachers graduates from WestTeach -,"Alyssa Bynum and Bob Sparks live in different West Tennessee communities, but they share some things in common. Both are successful teachers, both are dedicated educators, and both are now WestTeach graduates. They were members of the fourth WestTeach class that graduated Dec. 13 at the University of Tennessee at Martin.

WestTeach was created as a class project by the university’s 2017 WestStar Leadership Program class as a teacher-development initiative. A new class is selected annually by the program’s advisory committee following teacher nominations by school superintendents and directors. West Tennessee teachers selected to participate learn about the region’s economic needs and opportunities. Each class also meets with regional industry and community leaders to learn more about what their students might experience outside of the classroom both in the workplace and beyond. Twenty-four teachers completed the program bringing the four-year graduate total to 73. The Leaders Education Foundation is the program’s signature sponsor. Other WestTeach sponsors include Alexander Thompson Arnold PLLC, Security Bank in Dyersburg, SIC Management, Tennessee District of the TRANE Company, Cary and Lalania Vaughn of Millington, and the West Tennessee Healthcare Foundation.

Bynum, a third-grade teacher at Dresden Elementary School, was encouraged by her husband, Jake, to participate and experience what he described as “hidden value from WestTeach.” Jake is the Weakley County mayor and a 2013 WestStar graduate. “I was also really excited about the opportunity to get outside the four walls of my classroom and get some new and fresh ideas to bring to my classroom,” she said.

Participating with the different educators was likely her favorite part of the program, but she did question at first how the different educators would mesh and make the program work.

“I realized in the first couple of hours that really we all have the same end goal of getting our students ready for the real world, and all of our ideals and everything were aligned, and we were excited, and the room was full of educators who are excited to try new things,” Bynum said. “It was really empowering for me as an educator to be with that many people who love teaching as much as I do, so that was really the best part.”

Bynum said that she’s a “checklist person” as are many of her teaching colleagues. However, WestTeach showed that reaching out to her community, including leaders and businesses, can expand her teaching effectiveness beyond the classroom and her daily checklist of things to accomplish. “They’re out there, they’re waiting for me, but I need to make that more of a focus for myself,” she said of the resources that are all around her.

Bob Sparks teaches 11th and 12th grade English at Jackson Central-Merry Early College High. Also a veteran educator, his teaching career spans 15 years, including his four years at Early College High. Last year was especially significant for Sparks when he was chosen as his school’s Teacher of the Year, Jackson-Madison County Schools Teacher of the Year and was one of nine finalists for Tennessee Teacher of the Year and the West Tennessee Grand Division Finalist for the award.

In recent years, Sparks has become interested in the total educational system and seeing how education plays a larger role in communities. Among its programs, Early College High provides students the opportunity to earn an associate degree in cooperation with Jackson State Community College, so he sought more exposure to discussions about college and career readiness and workforce development. WestTeach offered a chance to learn more about these kinds of opportunities and resources in West Tennessee.

“There’s a real need for just this networking between the education sector, the business sector, higher education – because we really are just kind of at this like ‘catalytic moment’ in West Tennessee,” he said. “… There’s just a lot of opportunity and growth, and for us to really capitalize on that, it’s going to take everybody working together, this collective impact of schools, business, non-profits – everybody being on the same page to really take advantage of this and just make sure that the next generation has all the opportunities and dreams you want them to have.”

As with Alyssa Bynum, Sparks wants to make a difference in students’ lives, much like the teachers who influenced him. He also has teachers in his family, so the teaching profession appealed to him early on. “It’s just that family example and influence and then just the teachers I’ve had,” he said. “I want to give that back. I want to make that impact in students’ lives that they did for me.”

Dr. Versie Hamlett, Fayette County Public Schools superintendent, joined several West Tennessee school superintendents and directors who attended the event to support the WestTeach class members they nominated. Wes Holmes, a mathematics teacher at Fayette-Ware Comprehensive High School, was among this year’s graduates. “WestTeach is a great opportunity for classroom teachers to develop personal relationships, which will build a pathway for community success,” she wrote in an email response about the program. “The leadership activities allow teachers to be more effective in their roles.”

Hamlett is especially positive about the opportunity for WestTeach participants to grow as leaders in the teaching profession. “WestTeach is a guiding star that empowers educators to become true leaders for tomorrow,” she said. “This program allows teachers to demonstrate their true potential as teacher leaders in their buildings, which greatly impacts students, colleagues and communities.”

UT Martin Chancellor Keith Carver joined Dr. Charley Deal, the university’s vice chancellor for university advancement, in welcoming the group, presenting plaques and congratulating the graduating class. Carver was the event’s keynote speaker, but before his remarks, he told attendees how pleased he was to be among people who are passionate about educating young people and positive about the future.

“When you look at our country and all the things that we’re facing today and we’re fighting, I get encouraged daily when I go out to the schools and I meet students (while) recruiting them here to UT Martin,” he said. “We see the fruits of your efforts here daily, and so (we) just want to say, ‘Thank you so much for all you do.’”

Members of the 2022 WestTeach class are Melissa Berry, Henry County High School; Alyssa Bynum, Dresden Elementary School; Candi Collier, Milan High School; Bethany Enochs, East Elementary (Humboldt); Spencer Ezell, Huntingdon High School; Lisa Forsythe, McNairy Central High School; Wesley Holmes, Fayette-Ware Comprehensive High School; Tabias Hood, Tipton Rosemark Academy (Millington); Ann Johnson, Munford High School; Jamie Knott, South Fulton High School; Lauren Mathis, Dyersburg Intermediate School; Bellis May, Hardin County High School; Holly Meyer, Briarwood Elementary (Camden); Clayton Morris, West Carroll Jr./Sr. High School; Dana Parmenter, Ripley High School; Crystal Prince, Lake County High School; Rebecca Rainey, Lexington High School; Taylor Record, Dyer Elementary School; Monica Robbins, Holice Powell School (Dyer County); Deana Sain, Bolivar Middle School; Bob Sparks, Jackson Central-Merry Early College High; Jennifer Walls, Trenton Rosenwald Middle School; Ariell White, Anderson Early Childhood Center (Haywood County); and Haley Williams, Crockett County High School.

In a tweet, the former interior minister alleged that the ICT police raided his house at 12:30 am, while he was at his Lal Haveli residence.

However, the ICT police maintained that Sheikh Rashid’s statement was “not based on truth”, saying the police did not raid the house of any political leader or worker in Islamabad or Rawalpindi. They further said that he did not appear to be part of any political protest.

“Spreading false news about the Islamabad police should be avoided,” the ICT advised, warning that the police reserved the right to take legal action in response to false statements against it.

Commenting on the recent disqualification of the PTI chief Imran Khan, Sheikh Rashid stated that the Election Commission of Pakistan’s verdict would be struck down in just one hearing of the high court or apex court. He added that the ECP’s verdict was vague, misleading and unconstitutional.

“Those who escaped prison, want to throw Imran in jail,” Sheikh Rashid maintained. He also credited the Imran Khan government and institutions for Pakistan’s removal from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) ‘grey’ list.

In his tweet, the AML chief welcomed Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa’s announcement to not take any extension, and retire from his tenure as per schedule.

According to the AML leader, Pakistan’s rating has been reduced to a CCC+ since Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Ishaq Dar took up the reigns of the finance minister’s office. Sheikh Rashid was referring to Fitch Ratings downgrading Pakistan’s long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating (IDR) to CCC+ from B- on Friday.

Moreover, he stated that the entire nation was waiting for the Supreme Court’s decision on the amendments to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Ordinance.

He further said that the date of the election will be set on the streets, by the people, and be tabled in the National Assembly before November 30.",Q4

An early Green Lantern story he drew for DC Comics was rejected by the Comics Code Authority, which set the industry standards on what comics could depict.

Pennsylvania US Senate candidates

Fetterman and Oz faced off to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey in a battleground race critical to both parties' fortunes in the US Senate — and a seat Democrats are aiming to flip back from Republican control.

Fetterman has served as Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor since 2018 and was previously the mayor of Braddock, a borough in the western part of the state. Oz, a cardiothoracic surgeon, rose to prominence as a celebrity doctor thanks to exposure from Oprah Winfrey, and is best known for his work on television hosting the ""Dr. Oz Show.""

Fetterman, a progressive, centered his campaign around being a reliable 51st vote for Democratic priorities in the Senate. Like many Democrats running nationwide, he heavily advocated for enshrining abortion rights into federal law after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. He also supports changing the current filibuster rules to ease the passage of Democratic-led legislation and strongly supports marijuana legalization, even pushing President Joe Biden to decriminalize marijuana.

Fetterman's campaign also slammed Oz on social media for living in New Jersey for much of his adult life and career.

Meanwhile, Oz hammered Fetterman for his policy positions and sought to tie him to Biden's low public approval ratings. Oz, similiar to many Republicans, focused his platform on issues like the economy and crime.

Fetterman's health was also been a major focal point of the race as the candidate recovers from a stroke in May. Oz's campaign pressured Fetterman, who has had auditory processing difficulties, to release more medical information about his condition. Fetterman released a recent doctor's note that said the candidate ""is recovering well from his stroke and his health has continued to improve.""

Voting history in Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania is a competitive swing state that backed former President Donald Trump by 1.2 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election before flipping to support Biden by 1.2 percentage points in the 2020 election.

In the Senate, incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey defeated his GOP opponent Lou Barletta by 13 percentage points in 2018, a Democratic wave year. Toomey, meanwhile, defeated his final Democratic opponent, Katie McGinty, by just 1.5 percentage points in 2016.

The money race

This race will certainly stand as one of the most expensive 2022 midterm races in the nation.

According to OpenSecrets, Fetterman raised $56.7 million, spent $52.1 million, and had about $4.5 million in cash on hand, as of October 19. Oz raised $40.4 million, spent $37.7 million, and had $2.6 million in cash on hand, as of October 19. Oz personally accounts for the majority of the money his campaign has raised.

Meanwhile, super PACs, national party committees, politically active nonprofits, and other non-candidate groups have spent more than $240 million combined in the race as of November 7, including the primaries.

Evers Weighs Concerns Over TikTok Use, Security Concerns","MADISON, WI (WTAQ-WLUK) — Over the past month, there has been a growing push by Republican-run states and legislators to ban the social media platform TikTok on government devices — some looking for an all-out ban.

U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-8th District, along with other notable Republicans have urged Evers in a letter to ban TikTok on government phones and devices. Evers was asked if he has looked into their concerns.

“Certainly, and we have even before we received the letter from Rep. Gallagher,” said Evers. “We communicate regularly with the FBI and Wisconsin Emergency Management. They’re our go-to people on this issue and so we’re continuing that conversation, and we’ll be making some decision in the very near future.”

The FBI has acknowledged “national security concerns” about the U.S. operations of the China-based TikTok. It warns that the Chinese government could potentially use the video-sharing app to influence American users or control their devices.

“I just have to put one thing into context: The number of people that work for the state of Wisconsin that have access to TikTok, I could probably count on two hands,” said Evers. “And, so, this isn’t a widespread application that is used. But to make a long story short, we’re investigating this with the experts from the FBI and our emergency management and should have a decision in the near future.”

Several Republican-led states had already imposed bans on TikTok use on government devices, but Evers had not imposed any such ban.

Evers says what the experts tell him will determine whether he moves forward with a ban on government devices.",Q4
https://truthout.org/articles/more-than-two-dozen-abortion-clinics-closed-in-the-first-100-days-post-roe/,More Than Two Dozen Abortion Clinics Closed in the First 100 Days Post-“Roe”,"This story was originally published by The 19th

Twenty-six abortion clinics have shut down since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, per a new analysis from the Guttmacher Institute, cutting off access not only to abortion, but critical health services. And researchers say the number of clinics that shutter will only grow as abortion bans stay in effect.

The analysis looked at states where total or six-week abortion bans are being enforced. As of October 2 — the 100-day mark since Roe’s overturn — 66 clinics had stopped providing abortions, according to the report, including some in states where abortion is still legal. Previously, 79 clinics offered abortion in the 15 states studied; now, only 13 do.

A dozen of the clinic closures were in Texas, where abortion is almost entirely illegal and which enforced a law banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy months before the court undid Roe.

The abortion clinics that remain open — even if they aren’t providing abortions — still offer an array of reproductive services such as contraception, testing for sexually transmitted infections and gender-affirming care. As more clinics shut their doors, those services will be harder to come by.

“People in these communities are obviously losing access to abortion care, but they are losing access to other kinds of reproductive health care as well,” said Rachel Jones, a principal research scientist at Guttmacher and one of the authors behind the analysis.

The loss of services comes as more people were seeking abortions, data suggests. A June survey from Guttmacher found that in 2020, about 1 in 5 pregnancies ended in abortion, the first increase in 30 years.

In Ohio and Indiana, courts have blocked the states’ respective six-week and near-total abortion bans. Near-total bans remain blocked in Utah and Wyoming. And state courts in South Carolina and Iowa have not allowed six-week bans to take effect.

All of those cases are being actively litigated.

Meanwhile, lawmakers in other states may push to enact more punitive restrictions. In Nebraska, the governor attempted to call back the legislature to pass some form of abortion ban but reportedly fell three shy of the number of votes needed to pass a 12-week abortion ban. Florida is currently banning abortion for people after 15 weeks of pregnancy, but the legislature is expected to debate a stricter ban in the coming year.

If individual states ultimately are able to enforce these abortion bans, Jones said, the likely result would be even more clinics shutting down completely.

“The number of clinics providing abortion care will get lower,” she said. “The number of clinics that will have to shutter completely is going to increase.”

One clinic in Arizona has closed even though the state’s total abortion ban, which was passed in 1864, only took effect September 23. That ban is still being challenged in court.

That immediacy, Jones said, highlights that even if abortion bans are eventually overturned, the impact on abortion access can still be significant.

History supports that. When, in 2013, Texas passed a law imposing major restrictions on abortion clinics, many closed permanently. Even though that law was ultimately struck down by the Supreme Court, the relief came too late for providers, who often operate on thin margins.

“It’s not just a matter of, ‘Oh, we’ll just close our doors because there’s an abortion ban and we can reopen overnight if the ban is lifted,’” Jones said. “All this off and on is very difficult for clinics to operate. They can’t afford to keep staff on hand.”

We’re not backing down in the face of Trump’s threats. As Donald Trump is inaugurated a second time, independent media organizations are faced with urgent mandates: Tell the truth more loudly than ever before. Do that work even as our standard modes of distribution (such as social media platforms) are being manipulated and curtailed by forces of fascist repression and ruthless capitalism. Do that work even as journalism and journalists face targeted attacks, including from the government itself. And do that work in community, never forgetting that we’re not shouting into a faceless void – we’re reaching out to real people amid a life-threatening political climate. Our task is formidable, and it requires us to ground ourselves in our principles, remind ourselves of our utility, dig in and commit. As a dizzying number of corporate news organizations – either through need or greed – rush to implement new ways to further monetize their content, and others acquiesce to Trump’s wishes, now is a time for movement media-makers to double down on community-first models. At Truthout, we are reaffirming our commitments on this front: We won’t run ads or have a paywall because we believe that everyone should have access to information, and that access should exist without barriers and free of distractions from craven corporate interests. We recognize the implications for democracy when information-seekers click a link only to find the article trapped behind a paywall or buried on a page with dozens of invasive ads. The laws of capitalism dictate an unending increase in monetization, and much of the media simply follows those laws. Truthout and many of our peers are dedicating ourselves to following other paths – a commitment which feels vital in a moment when corporations are evermore overtly embedded in government. Over 80 percent of Truthout‘s funding comes from small individual donations from our community of readers, and the remaining 20 percent comes from a handful of social justice-oriented foundations. Over a third of our total budget is supported by recurring monthly donors, many of whom give because they want to help us keep Truthout barrier-free for everyone. You can help by giving today. Whether you can make a small monthly donation or a larger gift, Truthout only works with your support.

https://www.dl-online.com/news/minnesota/pedestrian-dies-after-suv-strikes-himnear-ottertail,SUV collision kills pedestrian in Otter Tail County,"PERHAM, Minn. — A 74-year-old man who was walking in the northbound lane of Highway 78 in Otter Tail County was struck and killed by an SUV traveling in the same lane, according to the Minnesota State Patrol.

The collision happened about 6:33 p.m. on Monday, Dec. 5.

As of Tuesday morning the identity of the man, who is from Palisade, had not been released.

The SUV driver was Dexter Brown, 32, of Ottertail, the State Patrol said.

The collision happened near the Round Lake Loop of Highway 78 between Round Lake and Rush Lake north of Ottertail.

The Otter Tail County Sheriff's Office, and the Perham police and fire departments assisted the State Patrol in responding to the collision.

https://www.realitytea.com/2022/10/31/dolores-catanias-porsche-was-stolen-from-her-boyfriends-driveway/,Dolores Catania’s Porsche Was Stolen From Her Boyfriend’s Driveway,"The Real Car Thieves Of New Jersey have struck again; this time, their target was our girl Dolores Catania. Page Six reports that her bright red Porsche was stolen right out of her new boyfriend’s driveway recently, leaving The Real Housewives of New Jersey star “shaken” but determined to get her vehicle back.

You might remember hearing about Dolores‘ Porsche on RHONJ. Her boyfriend at the time, Dr. David Principe, bought her the car, and some of the other New Jerseyans in the friend circle teased that he bought her the car instead of getting her an engagement ring.

“He didn’t give her a ring, so she didn’t move in [with him], but he just got her a Porsche,” Jackie Goldschneider said during a group scene.

Jackie’s husband, Evan Goldschneider, replied, “It means, ‘I’m just going to get you a car instead of a ring.'”

The conversation prompted Dolores to storm off, saying, “Everyone’s talking behind my back about getting a f–king Porsche, and I want to leave.”

Fast forward to today, Dolores is now dating Paul “Paulie” Connell, and the Porsche that David gifted her was stolen right out of her new man’s driveway. A source close to Dolores, who knows, maybe it was Paulie, told Page Six that the RHONJ star is shaken but not deterred.

“Dolores is determined to find her car with the help of authorities,” the source said. “She is aggravated but also really shaken up over the fact that someone would steal it right out of Paulie’s driveway.”

This isn’t the first time car thieves targeted the Real Housewives of New Jersey. Earlier this year, Bill and Jennifer Aydin’s Ferrari was stolen right out of their garage. The disturbing security footage showed masked robbers waltzing into the family’s garage and then driving off in their car, unbeknownst to Jen’s kids and parents, who were inside the house at the time.

In Jen and Bill’s case, people spotted the Ferrari out in the streets, and police quickly recovered the stolen car. Let’s hope that the same can be said for Dolores‘ Porsche. Keep your eyes peeled, people.

One person killed, four injured

DENVER – A man accused of driving into a crowd outside a Colorado bar after a fight, killing one person and seriously injuring four others, was on parole from prison at the time, according to court documents released Monday and authorities.

Ruben Marquez, 29, was released from prison in May after serving nearly three years for “aggravated motor vehicle theft, attempted escape, and a weapons and drug charge,” said a state Department of Corrections spokesperson, Annie Skinner. He was required to serve a mandatory two-year parole sentence, she said.

Marquez appeared by video from jail during a brief court hearing Monday to be advised of the possible charges he faces for ramming a white Silverado pickup truck into patrons and employees of the Rock Rest Lodge early Sunday in Golden, west of Denver. He was not asked to speak. Judge Jennifer Melton said he would have to remain behind bars because he'd been arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder.

Marquez was represented by a lawyer from the public defender's office, which does not comment publicly on cases.

Seven people were injured when they were hit by the truck, with four taken to the hospital, the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office said. Three remained in the hospital Monday but all were expected to survive, sheriff's spokesperson Jenny Fulton said.

The man who was killed was identified by the sheriff's office as 27-year-old Adrian Ponce. His brother was one of the four people taken to the hospital, along with two bar employees and a bar customer, according to the arrest affidavit for Marquez.

According to the affidavit, some witnesses said they thought the fight may have started over something to do with gangs and one described some “lighthearted banter” about gangs inside the bar earlier, as Marquez and two cousins celebrated a birthday. However, investigators have not confirmed the episode was related to gangs, Fulton said.

One of Marquez's cousins, who owns the truck Marquez is accused of driving into the crowd, told investigators some men approached him as he was leaving the bar and asked him what his gang affiliation was, causing him to get his cousins and leave, only to be confronted by the same people and others outside, the document said. He is accused of being an accessory to first-degree murder.

Prosecutors have until Friday to file charges against both men.

The United States Declaration of Independence was not yet six months old when George Washington and his Continental Army found themselves crossing the Delaware River from Pennsylvania to New Jersey in late December to do battle against British and Hessian German soldiers at what became known as the Battle of Trenton. In fact, Washington and his men crossed the river Christmas evening in 1776 and launched a surprise attack against enemy forces in New Jersey, giving colonial troops a much-needed victory. The victory in Trenton turned the tide in favor of the colonists, which set the stage for victory at the Battle of Yorktown in Virginia, and culminated in the establishment of the United States of America.

What many Americans do not realize, however, is that General Washington, perhaps America’s most famous founding father, never signed the Declaration of Independence. While the Declaration was being finalized and signed in Philadelphia, George Washington was in New York preparing the Continental Army for battle with England, which they knew would be a certainty once the British read the colonist’s declaration for freedom. Even though Washington did not sign the Declaration of Independence, it was up to him to implement it, provide the opportunity for hundreds of millions of future American dreams by literally creating the first and greatest American dream ever: The establishment of these United States of America.

The Declaration of Independence and American Economic Freedom

The Declaration of Independence rejected a monarchy, called for self-government, and placed limited control over people’s lives in the soon-to-be created nation. It boldly stated that all people are equal and that individuals had rights inherent in nature, endowed from a divine source. The Declaration of Independence declared that all future Americans be able to pursue the promise of life, liberty, and happiness. However, the Declaration of Independence was not a governing document. Upon victory at Yorktown, the “newly freed” Americans began working on a Constitution, a Bill of Rights, and to-date, 27 Amendments to the Constitution to create a system of government that would be driven by liberty, and create the freest and most prosperous people in the world. Along with political freedoms, the promise of the Declaration of Independence also created the foundation to establish the largest free enterprise economy in the history of the world. That promise has largely been realized with America being the envy of the world, generating more than $21 trillion in GDP, far and away the world’s most successful. The following are four of the most important pillars of today’s American economy that find root in the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.

U.S. Constitution. The U.S. Constitution created checks and balances over government by establishing three branches (Executive, Legislative and Judicial). It also called for federalism, giving the vast majority of power to local and state governments. Finally, the founding fathers knew they had not created a perfect document, and needed to give the people the power and means when absolutely necessary to change and improve the Constitution, and therefore America, via an arduous and thorough process for amendments. Amendments eliminating slavery and giving women the right to vote are examples of the “living” nature and often “self-correcting mechanism” of this great document. There have been more than 11,000 proposed amendments to the U.S. Constitution, with only 27 adopted.

Free Enterprise. For more than 135 years, the founding fathers rejected a federal income tax and called for limited regulations of the economy, with most regulation being the purview of individual states.

Economic and Social Meritocracy. The founders desired to create a country where people were judged and succeeded based on their abilities and results rather than who they were and where they came from. Today, for example, the most rapidly growing demographic of new business owners and entrepreneurs are women and minorities.

Freedom and the Flow of Knowledge and Information. The establishment of property rights and freedom of the press allowed for investment in ideas and new businesses. It created a risk-taking entrepreneurial class that is the envy of the world today. Even though we complain about freedom of the press, that too is being litigated in the forum of public opinion, as we write this article.

Following his swearing-in as California Governor on January 5, 1967, Ronald Reagan had this to say about freedom:

“Freedom is never more than one generation from extinction. We didn’t pass it on to our children in the bloodstream. The only way they can inherit the freedom we have known is if we fight for it, protect it, defend it, and then hand it to them with the well-fought lessons of how they in their lifetime must do the same. And if you and I don’t do this, then you and I may well spend our sunset years telling our children, and our children’s children what it once was like in America when men were free.”

This message is perhaps more appropriate today than when it was delivered to the people of California more than 55 years ago. Our national debt is now 121 percent of our U.S. GDP, growing from less than 35 percent of U.S. GDP when Ronald Reagan became president in 1981. We are over-regulating numerous industries from energy and automobiles to credit and fishing. And unfortunately, we adopted an income tax in 1913. According to the U.S. Congressional Budget Office, government consumption of our economy has grown from less than 8 percent of GDP in 1900 (local and state government 5 percent, federal government 2.8 percent) to roughly 42 percent today (local and state government 15 percent, federal government 27 percent). We believe 8 percent is too low to support our complex global economy, but hopefully we all agree that 42 percent is excessive.

As we prepare for this holiday season, let us all be thankful for General Washington and our founding fathers, the blessings, honor and privilege of living in America, and dedicate ourselves to increasing freedom in this great country, as part of our New Year’s resolution.

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2385400/crime-graph-in-three-districts-rises,Crime graph in three districts rises,"There has been an increase in the number of crime incidents in Gujranwala, Sialkot and Narowal districts in the last 10 months, according to reports.

Over 400 people have been killed in various incidents in the three districts since the beginning of the year.

Nineteen people lost their lives in Gujranwala as they resisted being robbed. Six people in Sialkot and two in Narowal died in similar incidents during the same period.

There have been thousands of incidents of robberies in the three districts in the last 10 months.

In more than 22,000 incidents, people were ripped off of millions of rupees and valuable items.

There were 7792 incidents of stealing of motorcycles, cars, tractors, vehicles, and rickshaws, including 353 in Narowal, 3861 in Gujranwala and 3578 in Sialkot.

In light of the current state of crime, the CPO of Gujranwala has directed all the SHOs to make it a priority to control crime, and the SHOs who failed to do so would be suspended, as per the directives of the IG of Punjab and the RPO of Gujranwala.

Meanwhile, the CPO has suspended the SHOs of the Sabzi Mandi and Garjakh police stations while several show-cause notices have been issued.

RPO Munir Masood Marth ordered the police of the three districts to not only put an end to the incidents of crime, but also arrest the perpetrators, retrieve the stolen valuables and then return them to the victims.

Meanwhile, the regional police arrested 1,119 absconders in October.

These absconders were allegedly involved in some serious cases, including terrorism.

In light of the orders by the Regional Police Officer, Munir Masood Marth, the regional police arrested the absconders during a special campaign.

Police discovered during the campaign that the absconders had been hiding in different districts. They also discovered that many of those absconders had not been lying low to avoid being arrested but, instead, were continuing with their criminal activities.

The RPO had given the SPs, the SDPOs and the SHOs from across the region the special task of arresting them.

The SHOs, with the help of intelligence, worked hard day and night to trace the whereabouts of the absconders and got them behind bars.

Regional Police Officer Munir Masood Marth said that the criminals who destroyed society’s harmony could not escape the reach of the law.

He ordered the SHOs to keep track of the accused who had been on bail as well as of those who had helped the accused get bail.

The investigation files of their cases should be strengthened and no loopholes should be left unplugged so that they did not get relief due to those loopholes when they appeared in courts.

The RPO also announced cash rewards and certificates to those police personnel who had performed well.

BEND, Ore. (KTVZ) – Nearly a week after a 70-year-old real estate investor and developer was shot and killed in the driveway of his home just east of Bend, Deschutes County District Attorney John Hummel confirmed the cause of death Friday and said it “remains a very active investigation.”

“Mr. (Leonard) Peverieri was shot and killed in the driveway of his home"" on Los Serranos Drive, Hummel told NewsChannel 21. ""We’ve been gathering evidence and interviewing witnesses on a daily basis since the shooting.”

Deschutes County sheriff's deputies on Monday identified the homicide victim, as a friend recalled Peverieri as a successful and ambitious but gentlemanly real estate investor and developer.

Anyone with ""information relevant to this case” was asked to contact the sheriff’s office at 541-693-6911. Janes also said that “Mr. Peverieri’s family is requesting privacy during this time.”

NewsChannel 21 was contacted Monday by someone who said Peverieri was a friend and former client who was a real estate investor and developer.

""Very ambitious, I would say, with his real estate investments,"" Jim Floyd said. ""Yeah, he was very successful, just a nice gentleman.""

County property tax records show Peverieri owned several properties, including his home on Los Serranos Drive, and also bought the tiny town of Millican east of Bend in 2010.

He was also a recreational marijuana producer before the Oregon Liquor Control Commission revoked his license for 13 violations in 2018.

Floyd, a real estate broker, said he sold Peverieri a home about seven years ago and they stayed in contact over the years.

“Other things he would like to do is deep sea fishing down in Mexico and so forth,"" Floyd said. ""I know he enjoyed that. He has some family in the area. I didn’t have the privilege of knowing all of them, but I know he has a wife, a daughter, and maybe other kids that I didn’t know about, and a couple of stepkids.""

The Tri-County Major Incident team, led by the sheriff’s office, was on scene throughout the day Sunday, investigating the circumstances surrounding Peverieri's death and collecting evidence.

Initially termed a suspicious death investigation, nearby residents had been advised to make sure their homes, outbuildings and vehicles were secured and report anything suspicious in the area.

Janes said deputies responded around 5:30 a.m. to the 21000 block of Los Serranos Drive, off Butler Market and Hamby roads, on a report of a deceased man.

“Upon the initial investigation, the death was determined to be suspicious,” Janes said in a brief initial news release.

In an update later Sunday, Janes said it had been determined to be a homicide but added, ""Detectives do not believe there is still a suspect in the vicinity of the crime scene.""

Janes had said Sunday he could not confirm police-scanner reports that a resident along the road had called 911 to report that someone was in their driveway who had been shot.

Scanner reports indicated Bend police also responded to help establish a perimeter and a K-9 team was called in. Oregon State Police and a SWAT team also went to the scene and a command post was established near Pine Nursery Park.

Officers initially were looking for a man riding a bicycle, but Janes said later they had contacted the man and that he turned out to be a neighborhood resident who was not involved.",Q4

Austin Harrouff, 25, was sent to a psychiatric hospital Monday after a judge accepted a plea deal accepting he was of unsound mind when he killed John Stevens, 59, and his wife Michelle Mischon Stevens, 53 in 2016 in Jupiter, Florida.

Michelle's sister Cindy Mischon said of the verdict: 'Here we are opening the prison doors for a double murderer.

'Four words come to mind. White, rich boy justice.'

Harrouff was just 16 when he was caught in the garage of his victims' home, chewing John's face after attacking both victims with a machete.

Cindy Mishcon, the sister of murder victim Michelle Mishcon, slammed 'white, rich boy justice' after Austin Harrouff was found not guilty by reason of insanity on Monday

Austin Harrouff, 25, was found not guilty by reason of insanity for the 2016 murders of John Stevens, 59, and his wife Michelle Mishcon Stevens, 53, at their home in Florida

Michelle and John Stevens were murdered in their garage in 2016 when Harrouff allegedly entered a mental episode and thought he was 'half dog, half man'

Harrouff said he could not remember the details of the murders, but believed God and demons were talking to him as he attacked the couple. He and his parents claim that he was mentally ill at the time of the incident.

Families of the victims angrily rejected this defense, arguing Harrouff was a drug addict who was well aware of what he was doing when he committed the crime.

He was initially accused of committing the killings while high on synthetic drugs flakka and bath salts. But a subsequent toxicology report found only traces of marijuana and prescription drugs in Harrouff's system.

In court on Monday, several family members presented victim impact statements directed at Harouff, his family, the defense team, and prosecutors.

Cindy Mishcon, who is also an attorney, laid out a methodical case of why she does not believe that Harrouff was insane when the killings occurred.

'You can't even look at me?' she asked Harrouff, who was sitting at the defense table, wearing a red and white striped prison uniform and glasses.

She said she had begun writing her victim impact statement when she was 'naïve enough' to think there would be justice.

Cindy Mishcon said that reality set in for her as she listened to tapes of Harrouff's jailhouse phone calls with family members and the reading of pages of text messages in the year prior to the killings, which were part of the court record.

The text messages with his friends outlined the life of a student who was smoking marijuana, taking other drugs and abusing alcohol during the year before killing the couple.

She said she realized 'you don't care about anyone but yourself' and that 'the only victim you and your family see is you, and the Harrouff name.'

'Is it really so hard for you to understand that you are a cold-blooded murderer and not a victim,' she asked.

'I ask myself, why are we here today?' she said. 'Why is there no trial? Why is my family being denied justice?'

'I didn't really know you could brutally murder two people, attempt to kill another, and not even have a trial,' Jodi Bruce, another sister of Mishcon, said. 'That was news to me'

Other family members echoed her sentiments.

'I didn't really know you could brutally murder two people, attempt to kill another, and not even have a trial,' Jodi Bruce, another sister of Mishcon, said. 'That was news to me.'

Two years after entering a not guilty plea on the grounds of insanity in 2020 it was accepted by Circuit Judge Sherwood Bauer in Martin County, Florida on Monday.

His ruling meant that Harrouff would be involuntarily committed into the custody of the Department of Children and Families for placement in a secured mental health facility.

Two mental health experts, one hired by the defense and another by prosecutors, examined Harrouff and found he suffered an acute psychotic episode during the attack, and couldn’t distinguish between right and wrong.

The decision was made during the first and final day of a trial that was expected to last three weeks.

Harrouff was a 19-year-old student at Florida State University when he killed the couple and stabbed a neighbor that came to help them, prosecutors say.

Bauer heard through documents filed in the court that in 2016 Harrouff entered a psychotic episode that left him thinking he was 'half-dog, half-man' when he attacked the couple near his Florida home.

Harrouff's attack made national headlines for its extreme brutality. He had been out for dinner at a restaurant with his father when he began acting erratically and left.

Harrouff is pictured here being taken in custody after the murders. He begged deputies to kill him after they pulled him off John Stevens and told them 'I ate something bad'

He then walked two miles to his mother's house where he mixed cooking oil with parmesan and attempted to drink it before his mother took him back to the restaurant.

After another altercation with his father, restaurant security footage showed Harrouff calmly leaving the restaurant 45 minutes before the attack.

He then walked four miles toward the Stevens' home where he entered their open garage and used their own tools to murder them.

Harrouff told TV psychiatrist Dr Phil he was escaping a demon he called Daniel and that he had only vague recollections of the killings.

He said he encountered Michelle Stevens in the couple's garage. She screamed, and 'then it's a blur,' he said.

'I don't remember what she said - I just remember being yelled at,' Harrouff said.

He said he grabbed a machete but doesn't remember why he killed her and her husband. He drank a range of additional chemicals in the couple's garage that caused him critical injuries.

When police arrived at the house they found the couple dead and Harrouff biting at John's face. Police said that they were threatening Harrouff with a dog, tasing him, and kicking him in the head to get him to stop.

Since the incident in 2016, Harrouff has said that cannot remember the details but believed God and demons were talking to him as attacked the couple in the brutal attack

In his judgment, Bauer said that two mental health experts, one hired by the state and one for the defense had concluded Harrouff was not sane when he killed the couple.

Bauer noted that the Harrouff defense team and state prosecutors 'agreed to this particular outcome, I'm sure based upon all the facts and circumstances that they had.

'It's a sad case, it's an awful case,' Bauer said.

'But when it all gets said and done, the state and the defense have made the determination that mental intent was not formulated. It wasn't there and therefore the defendant is technically not guilty by reason of insanity.'

Dr. Ohillipo Resnick, an expert for the defense, determined in 2019 that Harrouff was 'actively psychotic,' because he kept on attacking even when cops tased him and kicked him multiple times in the head.

Resnick claimed that the defendant suffered from 'clinical lycanthropy,' which involves believing you are a dog and explained Harrouff's dog-like behavior.

If found guilty, Harrouff would have been sentenced to life in prison without parole as prosecutors had already chosen not to pursue the death penalty.

This comes almost two years after Harrouff entered his not guilty plea back in 2020.

At the time, prosecution psychiatrist Dr. Gregory C. Landrum said Harrouff was legally insane when he fatally attacked Michelle and John Stevens outside their home in August 2016.

Landrum noted at the time that Harrouff was being treated for schizophrenia when he was jailed.

The psychiatrist's finding bolsters the case of Harrouff's attorneys, who are planning to argue the 23-year-old should be found not guilty by reason of insanity at his murder trial, which is scheduled for May.

Landrum's conclusion was that Harrouff was 'unable to distinguish right from wrong' when he killed the couple - the legal standard in Florida for being found not guilty by reason of insanity.

The trial was significantly delayed by the pandemic and Harrouff's slow recovery from critical injuries he sustained while drinking chemicals at the time of the attack.

MCDONALD COUNTY, Mo. — A Missouri couple is being charged with the kidnapping and murder of a pregnant Arkansas woman.

42-year-olds Amber and Jamie Waterman are facing federal charges for the disappearance and alleged murder of Ashley Bush. Amber Waterman is charged with one count of kidnapping resulting in death, according to court documents.

The federal criminal complaint alleges that between Oct. 31 and Nov. 2, 2022, Amber kidnapped Bush, who was 31 weeks pregnant, in order to claim her unborn child as her own. She allegedly took Bush from Maysville, Arkansas, to Pineville, resulting in her death.

Jamie Waterman has been charged with one count of being an accessory after the fact to kidnapping resulting in death. The federal criminal complaint alleges that he helped Amber Waterman after the kidnapping and murder.

Amber Waterman is accused of creating a fake Facebook account under the name of ""Lucy Barrows"" on Oct. 25, 2022, to lure Bush into meeting her so she could steal her unborn child.

Bush was reported missing on Monday, Oct. 31. Her fiancé, Josh Willis, told law enforcement that he saw her being driven as a passenger in a tan pickup truck by a woman he knew as “Lucy.” They had originally met “Lucy” at the Gravette public library a few days earlier, at which time “Lucy” was driving the same pickup truck. During this meeting at the library, “Lucy” and Bush had discussed employment opportunities, and later that day, “Lucy” offered to drive her to meet her supervisor at a Bentonville company, Bush's fiance said.

""Lucy"" was supposed to take Bush to Bentonville for an interview on Oct. 31, but when Bush’s fiancé showed up to pick her up at the Handi-Stop in Maysville he said he saw ""Lucy"" make eye contact with him and drive away.

According to an arrest affidavit, Amber told detectives that she had been home all day on Oct. 31 with her son and another child, and she ""went into labor"" that afternoon.

After calling 911, Amber traveled to meet an ambulance at a store in McDonald County. Amber told detectives that she had delivered a stillborn child that evening.

According to KOAM, our CBS affiliate, McDonald County Sheriff Evenson said they responded to reports of a newborn baby not breathing on Monday night. EMS intercepted the couple near Longview, Mo. as they were on the way to a hospital.

According to McDonald County Coroner BJ Goodwin, Amber allegedly had the placenta in her pants when EMS showed up, causing Jamie to think she had the baby.

Goodwin says a helicopter was called to take the baby and Amber to the hospital, but EMS could not revive the baby, and the baby died. Amber allegedly refused medical treatment, so the baby was taken to an area funeral home and the placenta was retrieved from her. Goodwin says that it appeared the baby was ""cut out"" of the mother.

On Nov. 1, detectives met with the Watermans who let them search the home and the tan-colored truck, matching the description of the one Bush was last seen in, according to prosecutors.

When detectives asked for Amber's phone, she told them that she had lost it. She also told investigators that she was the only person who had access to the tan-colored truck that was at the home.

When asked if she had known about Bush, Amber told detectives that she did not know her. When asked about ""Lucy Barrows,"" Amber said that she previously had worked with her at Walmart but they were not close, according to court records.

Also on Nov.1, the Watermans showed up at the funeral home to plan a ceremony for the baby that Wednesday. Goodwin says they wanted to cremate the baby's remains.

Goodwin says the service was scheduled for 1 p.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 2, but that morning the Benton County Coroner called asking for a DNA swab from the baby. He says he was very cautious as it seemed ""far-fetched"" and the family said she had already miscarried four times, so they were very ""emotionally upset.""

He says the Watermans tried to dispose of Bush’s body the same day they showed up for the baby’s memorial service.

“They got cleaned up after burning and disposing her body and showed up for a funeral,” Goodwin said.



He says the funeral was exactly what you would expect of parents who lost a child. Goodwin says nothing was out of the ordinary at the time and less than a dozen people were there.

Goodwin says the baby was a ""beautiful"" girl and that Amber was a ""cold-blooded killer"" and a ""good actor.""



According to Goodwin, the Benton County Coroner arrived after the memorial service to take the baby for an autopsy. Goodwin says the Waterman’s demeanor changed when they found out an autopsy would be performed, and Amber allegedly asked multiple times if DNA tests would be performed. He says as soon as Jamie heard that, he “got up and ran out of the funeral home.”



“Hands down craziest things I have ever dealt with as a coroner for 16 years,"" Goodwin said.



Goodwin says the Watermans had named the baby Dakota.

A vehicle at the Waterman's home was seized by law enforcement and search warrants were obtained on Thursday, Nov. 3, for their vehicle and home. During the search, detectives found what they believed to be blood stains on the inside of the vehicle.

Detectives questioned Jamie again on Nov. 3.

According to the affidavit, he told detectives that, after they had questioned them and left their home on Nov. 1, Amber told him she had killed Bush and then quickly changed her story and said “Lucy” had killed her.

Court records state that Amber led Jamie to the body of Bush, who was lying face down next to a boat near their house, covered in a blue tarp, on Nov. 1

Amber removed a ring from Bush’s finger and rolled her body onto the blue tarp, the affidavit says, which Jamie then dragged to a fire pit behind the home. The Watermans allegedly burned the body, moved it onto the bed of Jamie's blue GMC pickup, and drove a short distance from their home to hide the body.

In court on Nov. 4, the Watermans were assigned a public defender. The federal prosecutor asked the court to hold them without bond until their trial. A hearing will be held in Springfield on Nov. 9 for the court to rule on that issue. Until then, they will be in federal custody.

A Monmouth County jury last Wednesday found Julian B. Hart, 38, of Fourth Avenue, guilty of first-degree aggravated sexual assault, second-degree sexual assault, third-degree endangering the welfare of a child and third-degree possession of sexual abuse materials, said Monmouth County Prosecutor Raymond S. Santiago.

Stephanie Dugan, an assistant Monmouth County prosecutor, presented the case against Hart at a trial before Superior Court Judge Richard W. English. Hart was represented by Lawrence Township defense attorney Michael Kuhns.

The victim in 2021 reported being sexually abused by Hart on multiple occasions from Sept. 27, 2014, through December 16, 2015, when the child was under the age of 12, Santiago said.

Hart was on the state Megan’s Law registry for sex offenders and under lifetime parole supervision when the sexual abuse occurred, an investigation into the victim’s report revealed.

The state Megan’s Law registry lists Hart as a Tier 2 sex offender, posing a moderate risk of re-offending. The registry said Hart was convicted in 2009 of two counts of child endangerment for engaging in sexual conduct with two 11-year-old girls.

Court records indicate Hart was sentenced to 332 days in county jail for the 2009 conviction.Hart later pleaded guilty to failing to register as a sex offender in 2009, for which he received a brief jail term.

Court records also indicate Hart was sentenced to a year in prison in 2010 and again in 2014 in two separate incidents in which he pleaded guilty to criminal trespass for peering into windows. He was also sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2010 for marijuana possession, according to court records.

Authorities ask anyone with further information about Hart to contact prosecutor’s Detective Joseph Pahopin at 800-533-7443 or Asbury Park Detective James R. Crawford at 732-774-1300.

Hart is scheduled to be sentenced on April 28.

Bryan Christopher Kohberger is accused of four counts of first-degree murder and felony burglary, ITV News' Charlie Frost reports

A criminal justice graduate student is being held as a suspect in the mysterious stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students last month, authorities said.

Bryan Christopher Kohberger, 28, was arrested in eastern Pennsylvania on Friday, over 2,500 miles from the crime scene.

The students - Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin - were stabbed to death at a home near campus in Moscow, Idaho, sometime in the early morning hours of November 13.

Moscow Police Chief James Fry said Kohberger attends Washington State University, which is only a few miles across the state line from Moscow. Investigators are still looking for a weapon, Fry said at a press conference. He was emotional as he announced the arrest, calling the victims by their first names.

The four students were members of the university’s Greek system and close friends. Mogen, Goncalves and Kernodle lived in the three-story rental home with two other roommates. Kernodle and Chapin were dating and he was visiting the house that night. Autopsies showed all four were likely asleep when they were attacked. Some had defensive wounds and each was stabbed multiple times. There was no sign of sexual assault, police said. Ethan Chapin’s family emailed a statement after the press conference. “We are relieved this chapter is over because it provides a form of closure. However, it doesn’t alter the outcome or alleviate the pain,” the family wrote. “We miss Ethan, and our family is forever changed.”

The killings initially confounded law enforcement and shook the small farming community of about 25,000 people, which hadn't had a murder for five years.

But tips began pouring in after law enforcement asked the public for help finding a white Hyundai Elantra seen near the home around the time of the killings.

An unnamed law enforcement official told AP that DNA evidence played a role in identifying the suspect.

In recent days, federal investigators had been watching Kohberger and arrested him early on Friday morning at a home in Chestnuthill Township, Pennsylvania.

He is being held without bond in Pennsylvania, and will be held without bond in Idaho once he is returned, Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson said. The affidavit for four charges of first-degree murder in Idaho will remain sealed until he is returned, as required by state law. Kohberger is also charged with felony burglary in Idaho, Thompson said. An extradition hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.

Kohberger just completed his first semester as a PhD student in the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at Washington State University. “This horrific act has shaken everyone in the Palouse region,” said WSU provost Elizabeth Chilton in a statement.

“We will long feel the loss of these young people in the Moscow-Pullman community and hope the announcement today will be a step toward healing.”

Board, new evidence that U.S. schools are resegregating","Poor, black and Hispanic children are becoming increasingly isolated from their white, affluent peers in the nation’s public schools, according to new federal data showing that the number of high-poverty schools serving primarily black and brown students more than doubled between 2001 and 2014. The data was released by the Government Accountability Office on Tuesday, 62 years to the day after the Supreme Court decided that segregated schools are “inherently unequal” and therefore unconstitutional.

That landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education began the dismantling of the dual school systems — one for white kids, one for black students — that characterized so many of the nation’s communities. It also became a touchstone for the ideal of public education as a great equalizer, an American birthright meant to give every child a fair shot at success.

Advertisement

But that ideal appears to be unraveling, according to Tuesday’s GAO report.

The proportion of schools segregated by race and class — where more than 75 percent of children receive free or reduced-price lunch and more than 75 percent are black or Hispanic — climbed from 9 percent to 16 percent of schools between 2001 and 2014. The number of the most intensively segregated schools — with more than 90 percent of low-income students and students of color — more than doubled over that period.

The problem is not just that students are more isolated, according to the GAO, but that minority students who are concentrated in high-poverty schools don’t have the same access to opportunities as students in other schools.

High-poverty, majority-black and Hispanic schools were less likely to offer a full range of math and science courses than other schools, for example, and more likely to use expulsion and suspension as disciplinary tools, according to the GAO.

The GAO conducted its study during the past two years at the request of Democratic lawmakers including Rep. Bobby Scott (Va.), the ranking Democrat on the House education committee, and Rep. John Conyers (Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.

Scott on Tuesday announced legislation that would make it easier for parents to sue school districts for civil rights violations, saying the GAO report provided evidence of an “overwhelming failure to fulfill the promise of Brown.”

“Segregation in public K12 schools isn’t getting better; it’s getting worse, and getting worse quickly, with more than 20 million students of color now attending racially and socioeconomically isolated public schools,” he said in a statement Tuesday, calling on GOP leaders in the House to hold hearings on tackling segregation.

The resegregation of schools during the past two decades has for the most part happened quietly, in the shadows of loud battles over standardized testing, teacher evaluations, charter schools and Common Core academic standards.

Segregation has returned to the forefront of education policy discussions only recently, amid broad public debates about race, racism and widening inequality.

The persistence of racial divisions in the nation’s public schools was underscored Friday when a federal judge ordered a Mississippi district to integrate its middle and high schools, capping a legal battle that had dragged on for five decades.

As the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi put it, Cleveland, Miss. — a town of 12,000 bisected by railroad tracks that divided white families from black — has been running an illegal dual system for its children, failing year after year to reach the “greatest degree of desegregation possible.”

Now Cleveland must consolidate its schools, integrating all its students into one middle school and one high school.

“The delay in desegregation has deprived generations of students of the constitutionally-guaranteed right of an integrated education,” Judge Debra M. Brown wrote in her decision.

The Rev. Edward Duvall, an African American parent of two children in Cleveland’s public schools, said he favored consolidation because it would save money, leaving more funding for classrooms and programs. But that wasn’t the only reason: “We can break down this wall of racism that divides us and keeps us separated,” he said, according to court documents. “And we could create a new culture in our school system that’s going to unite us and unite our whole city.”

While schools in Cleveland have never fully desegregated, many other school districts did integrate following the decision in Brown v. Board. But since the 1990s, hundreds of school districts have been released from court-ordered desegregation plans, making way for renewed divisions by race and class.

In 1972, just 25 percent of black students in the South attended the most segregated schools, in which more than 90 percent of students were minorities, according to a 2014 ProPublica investigation. But in districts that emerged from court oversight between 1990 and 2011, more than half of students now attend such segregated schools, ProPublica found.

The investigation found fault with a Justice Department that, starting with the Reagan administration, pulled back from pressuring districts on desegregation and was “no longer committed to fighting for the civil-rights aims it had once championed.”

At the same time as federal courts were relinquishing oversight of school desegregation, the nation’s overall student population was changing, becoming poorer and less white. More than half of students are now low income, as measured by eligibility for subsidized meals. Hispanic students have replaced black students as the largest minority group in schools, accounting for 25 percent of the overall student population.

But the growing number of minority and low-income children in the nation’s schools does not mean that their segregation is inevitable, nor that they are doomed to receive fewer opportunities in school, Education Secretary John King Jr. said.

Just weeks after assuming the helm of the U.S. Education Department in January, King began calling on communities to find ways to diversify their schools. He was even more pointed this month, speaking of a “systematic lack of investment in high-needs communities and high-needs kids” that is made possible by policy choices that create segregated housing and segregated schools.

“The lack of concern for poor people is deeply disturbing,” King said.

On Tuesday, he said that the GAO report shows the need for a proposed new regulation that would change the way schools prove they are providing adequate resources for needy students. GOP leaders and school superintendents have criticized King sharply for the proposal, accusing him of an illegal overreach.

Advocates for desegregation as an essential tool for closing the nation’s persistent achievement gap have criticized the Obama administration for giving lip service to the issue without taking meaningful steps to address it.

https://www.informationweek.com/government/october-2022-global-tech-policy-bulletin-from-twitter-s-new-management-to-big-tech-lobbying-scandals,October 2022 Global Tech Policy Bulletin: From Twitter’s New Management to Big Tech Lobbying Scandals,"Hello and welcome back to Citizen Tech, InformationWeek’s monthly policy roundup. In this edition, we’re looking at Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter; the next steps for Biden’s semiconductor policy; recent developments in cybersecurity; Starlink broadband access in Ukraine; a lobbying scandal uncovered at the European Parliament; how modern technology is like magic and our geopolitics like the Lord of the Rings, per Bruno Maçães; an antitrust vote in the House of Representatives; and more.

Next Word for The Bird

Well, he did it. As the New York Times announced at the end of the month, Elon Musk has acquired Twitter, at a cost of $44 billion and months of negotiations with Twitter and the SEC. One of his first moves was to fire four major officers, including the CEO and general counsel. Now Musk’s job is to defend his empire from the massive debt he took on to acquire it. According to the Times, it will take $1 billion per year just to keep up with the interest. Musk has well-heeled friends at firms like Andreesen Horowitz (a16z) and others that have announced their willingness to help keep the new Twitter afloat.

This latter point has political significance. The obvious political battle, which Musk evidently won, was one of content moderation. The Biden administration and other major governments (the Von der Leyen Commission in Brussels, notably) have made misinformation and disinformation a central focus for tech policy. Twitter, pre-acquisition, had assisted in that effort, flagging, or suppressing what it judged to be misinformation. Naturally, this came with problems, there being no objective measure for every statement -- or worse, every opinion -- expressed in this public forum; conservatives in particular had long complained that “misinformation” was a conveniently malleable charge, and the decision-making intentionally opaque. Musk, however, calls himself a “free speech absolutist.” That’s good news for dissenters, but it also means that all kinds of noxious speech can seep into your timeline sooner than you’d like: calls to murder or genocide, sexually or ethnically charged abuse, outright lies from foreign propaganda machines. The Democrats in particular are in a panic. One party bigwig told POLITICO that the new management had “huge and terrible ramifications.” One of these, of course, could be Donald Trump’s triumphant return from Twitter exile, whether or not he’s serious about running in 2024.

Brussels is watching this with disapproval as well. When Musk announced that “the bird is free,” the EU’s internal market commissioner Thierry Breton shot back that “in Europe, the bird will fly by our rules.” Pity the American civil servants, most of them Democrats, who may eventually find themselves defending Musk in trade and communications meetings with the European Commission.

Musk did announce that he was forming a content oversight council for the new Twitter, and that he would not change moderation standards before that council met. But Musk’s open alliance with a16z, among others, and his proposal to charge $8 (originally $20) per month for a blue check, suggest that speech may be freer on Twitter the more money you care to spend for it.

Next Steps for CHIPS

The White House is not ready to take on the challenge of online speech and has released no statements on the subject; it’s busy preparing for the midterms and recovering from the grueling work of passing the CHIPS bill. A who’s who of Federal tech leadership met on October 7 as part of the steering committee that will oversee the new semiconductor policy, including NSA’s Jake Sullivan, secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen, commerce secretary Gina Raimondo, and a brigade of assistant secretaries and chief advisors. No industry leaders were invited. The group discussed Secretary Raimondo’s manufacturing incentive roadmap, as well as the diplomatic and military implications of the new legislation (supply chains, defense systems, etc.).

The White House Talks Cybersecurity

On the 11th, the White House released a kind of greatest hits tape of its cybersecurity triumphs so far, from new cybersecurity protocols at TSA (the memory of the Colonial Pipeline attack hovering between the lines like a ghost) to $185 billion in grants to state and local cybersecurity efforts in FY2022. To be clear, this is election season propaganda, but the victories they chose to celebrate are interesting. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing new post-quantum encryption standards, which should be ready by the next presidential election. The White House also boasted of its ban on a number of cryptocurrency mixers, frequently used to launder ransom money. There’s no love lost between Biden and the crypto sector, and apparently no one thinks a rapprochement would get any more Democrats elected.

Later in the month, national cyber director Chris Inglis hosted a number of senior civil servants from across departments and industry leaders to discuss the cybersecurity implications of a new electric vehicle ecosystem. This was mainly a forum for discussion, and thus not terribly exciting, but serious money is in play: $7.5 billion in electric vehicle charging infrastructure alone, plus “billions more” in investments and incentives for the sector. The conclusions the meeting drew have yet to be announced.

Big Tech in Trouble at the House

On September 30 the House of Representatives fired a warning shot at Big Tech firms like Meta and Amazon, by way of new antitrust regulations (via AP). The bill would hand federal prosecutors the ability to determine where Big Tech cases may be litigated. Generally, Big Tech lawyers try their best to have their cases heard by the northern Californian courts near their own headquarters; these judges tend to favor the local gentry. The bill would also raise court fees for big companies while lowering fees for small and medium-sized companies. The Biden administration has smiled on this bill, which both enrages Republican Congressmen and puts them in a tricky spot, defending the rights of the same tech behemoths they consider their enemies in the information war. AP notes that the Democrats, too, have to walk a thin line -- social media platforms are such a fixture of their constituents’ lives that any unnecessary complication might sway voters against incumbent lawmakers. Nevertheless, the bill passed by a wide margin, 242 to 184, and now goes to the Senate.

War Bulletin No. IX

The Russian offensive has lost momentum, and as troops pull back from the Kherson front and punitive shellings replace physical occupation, the Kremlin prays for a cold winter. The European Commission has been scrambling to find a way to keep people from freezing over the next six months in the absence of Russian gas. This month they proposed a plan called REPowerEU, for the EU and neighbors like Ukraine and Kosovo, which would rush new contracts with energy suppliers (including companies in the US, Norway, and Algeria). The plan includes a “rapid roll out” of solar and wind projects, and long-term goals of energy diversification by 2030.

The most exciting part of the plan, from a tech perspective, is a proposed hydrogen accelerator that would produce 10 million metric tons of renewable hydrogen in usable form. But that surely won’t be running before 2025 or so. The REPowerEU plan more or less states that the brunt of this winter will fall on individual households, who will pay dearly for heating and electricity.

In the meantime, we must return to Elon Musk, who has variously offered Starlink satellite internet (from SpaceX) to beleaguered Ukraine and cozied up to the Kremlin over the past few months. A strange tweet on October 15 seemed to announce that Musk would continue funding Starlink services “for free,” at enormous expense. He then (according to reports by CNN) asked the Pentagon for help, saying that SpaceX couldn’t manage the cost alone. The price of free internet service for the whole country is astronomical, some $400 million over the course of a year (not counting the end of 2022), according to CNN. Musk claimed that SpaceX couldn't afford to send more broadband terminals, although CNN notes that connectivity, not actual terminals, is the major expense. In any case, Musk’s late “pro-peace” stance, and his Twitter polls and exchanges with the likes of Russian senior minister Dmitri Medvedev, have enraged Kyiv. Starlink broadband was always going to be spotty, given the ongoing war; it may go away altogether.

In Brussels: Biden and Data Protection

Since 2020, the European Court of Justice has been concerned with the extent to which American security forces can pry into European data flows. This year, the European Commission and the White House arrived at a compromise on how to protect European data, which Biden made official by executive order on October 7. The order enacts a complicated new compliance framework, including a review court for European citizens who feel their privacy rights, as established by GDPR, have been infringed on.

In Strasbourg: Big Tech Lies to Parliament (maybe)

Three members of the European Parliament accused eight Big Tech firms including Meta, Google, and Amazon of lying during hearings concerning upcoming digital market legislation, according to POLITICO. They allege that the companies’ lobbyists claimed to be representing small and medium-sized enterprises, which are favored by the yet-to-be-enacted Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA). If that’s the case, the firms in question could face fines, and potentially scare off any sympathetic MEPs.

Paul Tang (Netherlands, PvdA) told POLITICO that ""This is foul play ... It violates the entirety of transparency on lobbying; you need to identify yourself, we need to know to know as MEPs or as other officials in the European Union who we deal with.""

Tech and Tolkien

Portuguese writer and international affairs grandee Bruno Maçães may have been born with a rugged, Northern European imagination. Last time we reported on him he was comparing semiconductors to the ring in Wagner’s opera cycle. This month he took to the New Statesman to compare modern technology (and geopolitics) with the dark magic of The Lord of the Rings.

“In a technological society, as we pursue our fantasies unimpeded by the physical world, the human soul is suddenly in charge of our actions. Generous and noble motives are magnified, but so too are our darkest fantasies of power and cruelty... The world order is being designed and redesigned. Vladimir Putin speaks in these terms...”

Maçães’ libretto may have to wait until he’s back from Mount Doom.

A Las Vegas woman accused of murdering her own mother on Wednesday told police during a prior arrest in late August that they were only detaining her because they had never seen anyone ""as good looking.""

Hend Bustami, 28, is facing an open murder charge in Clark County for the Oct. 26 death of her mother in Las Vegas , and she is also charged with evading arrest in San Bernardino County, California, county records show.

Las Vegas police officers responded to reports of a person injured on June Flower Drive around 2:30 a.m. Wednesday and later determined that the victim, Bustami's mother, had been involved in a verbal dispute with her daughter before her death, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) said in a Wednesday press release.

California Highway Patrol located Bustami near Barstow, California, later that day. She will be charged with open murder and extradited back to Clark County, LVMPD said.

Elon Musk’s fan boys should note that SpaceX is not the only private company that has attempted colonisation of a foreign land.

In December 1606, the Virginia Company of London sent three ships from England to Virginia with the singular goal of making profit. The indentured servants sent to the new colony signed contracts to work for several years in exchange for land and freedom. Things did not go as planned. Between 1609 and 1610, life in the new colony disintegrated in a Lord of the Flies-like fashion. Out of the 500 original settlers nearly 400 either starved to death, died of disease, or were killed by the Powhatan native Americans. Those who managed to survive did so by eating the rotting corpses of their fellow humans.

There are many lessons somebody planning to colonise Mars could extrapolate from this historical example. While Elon Musk may argue that his Martian ambitions are simply to make human life “multiplanetary”, he could contemplate whether a private company accountable to shareholders is the best institution to colonise another planet. Musk could also ask himself what type of government the Red Planet should have. Should it have an appointed governor imported from the Republic of Tesla in California? How can civilisation on this new planet avoid recreating the types of inequalities that put disproportionate amounts of power in the hands of a few billionaires? Or, better yet, should we even try to spread capitalism to Mars when it’s doing such a great job of destroying Earth?

Musk will not find the answers to these deeper questions about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness by flipping to the back of the book and looking up the answer key. They also cannot be reduced to the kind of yes-or-no polls that Musk poses to his chorus of tech-bro libertarian fan boys on Twitter.

Musk’s rise comes at a time when the academic disciplines that would force him to question not just can I as an unelected billionaire bring life to Mars and regulate free speech, but should I, are being threatened. The study of humanities has come under fire from a brigade of “anti-woke” right-wing politicians across the world. In the words of the Republican Florida senator Marco Rubio: “We need more welders and less philosophers.”

If Rubio had paid better attention during his political science classes at the University of Florida (funded in part by taxpayers through student loans), not only would he understand the difference between less and fewer, he’d understand that democracies benefit from having more philosophical welders. A welder with a degree in the humanities not only knows about fusing metals but also has a decent enough understanding of history to be scared of the rising tide of authoritarianism, and vote accordingly.

Since the financial crisis of 2007-08, one recent report has said that the number of students studying a humanities degree in the US has dropped from around 15 per cent of all bachelor’s degrees studied to 10 per cent in 2020. In the UK, the Tory government announced it would slash funding for degrees in which less than 40 per cent of students go on to “highly skilled” positions.

This devaluing of humanities degrees has little to do with concern that students won’t land a decent job after graduation. Philosophy majors make great lawyers, music majors win Baftas for writing symphonies, and those with a degree in classics can go on to become disgraced journalists and prime ministers. Even graduates who do not use their liberal arts degree in their line of work can use analytical thinking skills to conclude faster than Musk that a tree is the best carbon capturing technology we have.

A society that values the humanities is one that would question whether the Musks of the world who were lucky enough to make good investments from inherited money should be granted the authority to own the marketplace of ideas. It would also be a society that understands better than the new owner of Twitter that our future as a species relies not just on developments in technology, but also on how we decide to use them.

https://www.whec.com/top-news/news10nbc-investigates-heres-the-transcript-of-a-parolee-released-one-week-before-he-was-charged-with-murder/,News10NBC Investigates: Here’s the transcript of a parolee released one week before he was charged with murder,"ROCHESTER, N.Y. — News10NBC has the transcripts that show why a man who violated parole a month after he got out of prison was allowed back into the community.

A week after that court decision, the parolee was arrested for murder. The man’s name is Lequan Hill. Hill was paroled from prison in September. In October, he was arrested for cutting off his ankle bracelet.

The transcript is from the parole recognizance hearing the next day. The transcript shows the parole officer wanted the court to keep Hill in jail until the parole violation case was over.

“The recommendation of the Department is to remand pending outcome of the violation proceedings,” Parole Officer Traci Schrader said.

That process can take up to 90 days. But Hill’s lawyer said parole found Hill at his family’s home, that he just got a job and the maximum penalty for cutting off his ankle bracelet is seven days “which he would far exceed should he be remanded into custody” said Krystian Opalinski from the Monroe County Public Defender’s Office.

News10NBC has the transcripts that show why a man who violated parole a month after he got out of prison was allowed back into the community.

Judge Doug Randall agreed, saying, “Mr. Hill was found in his home and can only receive a seven-day sentence if he’s convicted of absconding, so I’m going to release Mr. Hill pending the preliminary hearing and final hearing.”

Hill was released to parole with a new GPD bracelet. One week later, Lequan Hill was arrested for stabbing and killing a neighbor, Antoine Parris.

Michael Harrigan, Assistant District Attorney: “There was an argument that Mr. Hill was having with his father at the time and Mr. Parris attempted to intervene and then Mr. Hill stabbed him.”

Brean: “He’s a parolee. He was let out of prison early. How does that impact the prosecution of a murder case?”

Harrigan: “It doesn’t impact the prosecution of it. It might impact a bail argument.”

Hill is now in jail without bail. The state parole reform called “Less is More” affected what happened to Hill prior to the murder.

Among the changes, the reform moved these parole violation recognizance hearings from prisons into county courts and told judges the only factor they can consider is whether a parolee will show up to court.

Brean: “Prior to Less is More, could a judge consider or could the system consider whether or not a parolee was dangerous?”

Gina Lopez, NYS Parole Officer: “Before Less is More, any violation was an automatic detain-in-custody until your violation process was completed.”

On behalf of Judge Randall, the state office of court administration said “Judge Randall was only allowed to consider if this parole violator is a flight risk or if he will return to court. He is not allowed to consider if the violator presents a danger to the community.”

Advocates for parole reform say approximately 13,000 parolees have done well enough they were removed from parole early, reducing the number of parolees in New York State by almost half. Hill is back in court on the murder case in February.",Q4
https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-red-state-murder-problem-thats-just-a-democratic-driven-myth/,The ‘Red State Murder Problem’? That’s Just a Democratic-Driven Myth.,"With Republicans hammering them over rising murder rates, Democrats have come up with a new line of defense: Republicans, they claim, are the ones really responsible for the surge in homicides. The United States, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) recently declared, has a “red state murder problem.”

No, it doesn’t. The bogus claim comes from a March study by the Democratic think tank Third Way, which purports to show that, contrary to “the right-wing obsession over homicides in Democratic cities: murder rates are far higher in Trump-voting red states than Biden-voting blue states.” According to Third Way, of the top 10 states with the highest per-capita murder rates in 2020, eight (Missouri, Louisiana, Kentucky, Alabama, Tennessee, South Carolina, Mississippi and Arkansas) voted for Donald Trump, while just two (New Mexico and Georgia) voted for Joe Biden. “Republicans seem to do a much better job of talking about stopping crime than stopping crime,” Jim Kessler, an author of the report, told Axios.

One problem with that: In most of these red states, the high murder rates are driven by the lethal violence in their blue cities.

https://www.klkntv.com/nebraska-one-of-many-states-excluding-mental-health-crises-from-abortion-exemptions/,Nebraska one of many states excluding mental health crises from abortion exemptions,"Nebraska one of many states excluding mental health crises from abortion exemptions

LINCOLN, Neb. (KLKN) – Nebraska is one of many states with a clause in its abortion ban that mental health advocates say is cruel.

While there are exemptions for life-threatening emergencies, psychiatric crises don’t count.

An Arizona mother of three who became suicidal during her fourth pregnancy said an abortion saved her life.

Another woman, Kara Zivin, said she nearly died from a suicide attempt during pregnancy.

Zivin is a professor of psychiatry and obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Michigan.

She ended up giving birth to a healthy baby, but she sympathizes with women facing psychiatric emergencies who believe their only option is to abort.

At least eight states, including Nebraska, currently allow exemptions for life-threatening physical health conditions. The mother’s mental health is not included.

Some exemptions are murkily written, and others are explicit.

Laws in Nebraska, Georgia and West Virginia specify that medical emergencies don’t include suicide threats.

In Nebraska, exceptions to the 20-week abortion ban are the following:

The mother has a medical condition that is so severe, abortion would be necessary to save her life or prevent irreversible physical impairment to her bodily function If removing the fetus is necessary to preserve its life

“People often try to treat mental health as distinct from physical health, as if your brain is somehow removed from the rest of your body,” Zivin said.

Some say the laws are intended to keep women from faking mental illness to get doctors to approve their abortions.

Patricia, 31, of Phoenix spoke to the Associated Press on the condition that only her first name be used, citing safety concerns and privacy.

She said a wave of severe depression hit her in the summer of 2018 and broke “not only my mind, but my heart and soul.”

Panic and suicidal thoughts “bombarded her,” she said, and she was unable to eat, sleep or properly care for her three young daughters.

A few weeks later, she learned that she was pregnant again and knew she would be unable to mother another child.

At the time, her abortion was legal in Arizona. Recently, the state made moves to enact a near-total ban, which has since been put on hold.

U.S. studies say postpartum depression affects 1 in 8 women, but evidence suggests that depression during pregnancy may be even more common.

Mental health conditions, including suicide and substance use, became the leading underlying cause of pregnancy-related deaths in 2017-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a September report. It was ahead of bleeding, heart conditions and infections.

Zivin co-authored a study published last year that found that suicidal thoughts and behavior among pregnant women were rising.

Zivin never considered ending her pregnancy 10 years ago, but she said she understands why women who become suicidal would feel that abortion is their only option.

She calls the limited exemption laws “unfortunate” and said politicians who wrote them “don’t appreciate or understand the burden of mental illness.”",Q4

According to a Dec. 15 motion, Mesac Damas, 46, asked the Florida Department of Corrections to release his May medical and psychiatric records.

The motion, in response to a Dec. 12 subpoena where the state sought the release of Damas' records, alleges they're relevant to a pending proceeding; lead to the discovery of admissible evidence; haven't been previously obtained in discovery; and aren't available in the state's archives.

Deemed competent in court:Naples man accused of killing wife, 5 kids more than 13 years ago deemed competent in court

Throwback:The 2010s: A look back at the biggest stories in Collier, Lee counties

The state sought the release of Damas' physical condition and medical treatment during a Nov. 15 hearing.

During that hearing, Damas complained about chest pains, court records indicate. Jail personnel took him to the emergency room Nov. 17.

""Due to continuing and persistent health-related issues, Mr. Damas requests that he not be brought to Collier County for the evidentiary hearing,"" court records from a recent hearing read in part.

The state alleged the complications arose from Damas' refusal to eat or drink while he was at the Collier County Jail. During that hearing, Damas said he refused to eat or drink as he believed the edibles were ""poisoned,"" records indicate.

Records indicate he's receiving treatment for diabetes.

Damas pleaded guilty to the six murder counts Sept. 5, 2017. His death penalty trial followed in late 2018.

On Nov. 7, Collier Circuit Judge Ramiro Manalich ruled that Damas is fit to proceed to a post-conviction hearing, court records show. He's attempting to appeal his sentence.

Through statute, he's eligible for the hearing because several experts found him competent.

Damas killed Guerline Dieu Damas, and their five children — Michzach, 9, Marven, 6, Maven, 5, Megan, 3, and Morgan, 1 — slicing their throats with a filet knife in their North Naples townhouse.

Court records indicate his attorneys presented a motion to waive Damas from the evidentiary hearing, which would determine the fate of his death row appeal.

They claimed that traveling for the hearing would disrupt his daily medication schedule and dosage. He's incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution in Railford, a little more than 300 miles from Southwest Florida.

The motion argued that while incarcerated at the Collier County Jail, a disruption to his medication has caused Damas anxiety.

""The emotional and physical stress of being transported back and forth from death row is something Mr. Damas wishes to avoid if possible,"" the motion said in part.

Background to Damas' case

In late 2018, Florida's Supreme Court affirmed six death sentences for six murders in Damas' case.

Damas was sentenced in October 2017 after he pleaded guilty to the six murder counts.

The sentencing brought the case to a close after it had dragged on for more than eight years amid seemingly endless delays.

Collier Sheriff Kevin Rambosk had called the killings “the most horrific and violent event” in county history.

Damas fled to Port au Prince, Haiti, where he was born and raised. But authorities located him days later.

https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/1002469-justice-project-pakistan-stages-limbo,Justice Project Pakistan stages Limbo,"Is it just us or is October really the month of horror that goes beyond Halloween? For an inmate on death row, every day might feel like the next jump scare is just around the corner. What we do know is that approximately four years ago, Justice Project Pakistan collaborated with director, writer and actor Sarmad Khoosat for No Time to Sleep, depicting the life of Prisoner Z in the last 24 hours of his life. The man depicting Prisoner Z was Sarmad Khoosat and the stream was without edits and any cuts. Watching it makes you wonder what kind of justice system we follow, if it makes you feel hurt by, angry at, and dread the machinery behind it.

Now – in the present – as the debate (or lack thereof in the corridors of power) over the question of the death penalty looms as a reality in Pakistan, Justice Project Pakistan in commemoration of World Day Against the Death Penalty (on October 10) presented a play titled Limbo.

A collaboration between JPP and Olomopolo Media, it was staged at the Pakistan National Council of Arts (PNCA) in Islamabad and was conceptualized by Kanwal Khoosat, directed by Talhah Mufti with sound design by Agha Haider.

The play, Limbo, entailed performers reading letters written by incarcerated prisoners on death row. An illustrious cast came together for this gut-wrenching real-to-stage theatre production which included Sarmad Khoosat, Samiya Mumtaz, Erfan Khoosat, and Hassan Wajid Baig.

The letters from incarcerated inmates were, according to a press statement, interspersed with “passages from George Orwell’s essay, A Hanging, and regulations from the Pakistan Prisons Rules.”

The theatre production was a reflection of the dysfunction within Pakistan’s justice system such as “torture, false confessions, juvenile detention – as well as shine a light on the humanity of those behind bars.”

The collaboration - between JPP and Olomopolo Media - was meant to highlight important issues pertaining to crime and punishment.

As Kanwal Khoosat (Executive Director of Olomopolo) noted, Limbo was about “showcasing narratives that society forgets, those that society wishes it did not have to remember or acknowledge.”

“This year, the theme of the WDADP is torture – a theme that has particular resonance for our country since a significant number of death row prisoners have been sentenced to death on the basis of evidence extracted under torture. The heartbreaking stories of our clients in Limbo highlight the urgent need to reform Pakistan’s criminal justice system. We also implore our lawmakers to legislate criminalizing torture so that some of the stories you hear during this performance don’t ever have to be repeated,” stated Sarah Belal, Executive Director, JPP.

The power of the government to execute its people is not a common global practice, with at least 108 countries having abolished the death penalty for all crimes in 2020 by statistics from Amnesty International.

What are we waiting for to do away with this punishment, is a much more complex question than the crime itself might have been. In the end, we can only hope such efforts bring about intelligent conversation on how to move forward as a country. But perhaps the answer lies in acknowledging that there is no such thing as a born criminal.",Q4

Officials said the 15 Khordad Foundation was targeted for providing 'financial support for an act of terrorism'.

As recently as 2012, the group offered a multi-million dollar reward for the murder of Rushdie, 75, because of his novel The Satanic Verses, which some Muslims consider blasphemous.

In August, he was violently attacked at a literary event in New York state.

The author had lost sight in one eye and the use of a hand following the attack.

Rushdie's literary agent Andrew Wylie said he had suffered 'serious wounds' to his neck and '15 more wounds to his chest and torso'.

Rushdie, who is British American, was stabbed several times in the neck and abdomen before he was due to give a talk at the Chautauqua Institution.

He was air-lifted to a nearby hospital for emergency surgery, and though his condition improved in subsequent weeks, his agent has said the writer lost sight in one eye.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US condemns the attack on Rushdie 'in the strongest terms as a blatant assault on freedom of speech and an act of terrorism'.

He said the organization is also being designated for diplomatic penalties.

The sanctions and designations deny the group access to any property or financial assets held in the US, and the ability to travel to the US.

'The United States will not waver in its determination to stand up to threats posed by Iranian authorities against the universal rights of freedom of expression, freedom of religion or belief, and freedom of the press,' said Brian Nelson, Treasury's under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.

'This act of violence, which has been praised by the Iranian regime, is appalling. We all hope for Salman Rushdie's speedy recovery following the attack on his life.'

The main suspect, Hadi Matar, a 24-year-old from New Jersey with roots in Lebanon, was arrested immediately after the attack on Rushdie.

He pleaded not guilty during a hearing in New York state in mid-August.

The attack sparked outrage in the West but was praised by extremists in Muslim countries like Iran and Pakistan.

Sanctions records show the 15 Khordad Foundation was created in 1979 and is affiliated with deceased Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

Rushdie had lived in hiding for years after Iran's first supreme leader ordered his killing for what he deemed the blasphemous nature of The Satanic Verses'.

Blinked added: 'The infamous fatwa was intended to incite terrorism and violence, bring about the death of Rushdie and his associates, and intimidate others.'

The Daily Mail revealed this month that Rushdie has apparently married poet Rachel Eliza Griffiths, who is 31 years his junior.

Rushdie’s great friend and fellow novelist Ian McEwan suggested Griffiths, 44, is now Rushdie’s fifth wife.

Atonement and Amsterdam author McEwan said: ‘His wife, Eliza, is with him all the time.’

She was said to be helping to nurse the author back to health.

‘I’ve had some indirect contact with him and he’s going to be back with us. He’s strong, he’s a very courageous man. He’s got lots to say, and I’m sure we’re going hear from him again.’

The US has hit Iran's government with a host of sanctions this year for a variety of actions related to human rights abuses.

Financial penalties were imposed after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September.

https://www.history.com/topics/native-american-history/native-american-timeline,"Native American History Timeline ‑ Education, Tribes, Events","Long before Christopher Columbus stepped foot on what would come to be known as the Americas, the expansive territory was inhabited by Native Americans. Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, as more explorers sought to colonize their land, Native Americans responded in various stages, from cooperation to indignation to revolt.

After siding with the French in numerous battles during the French and Indian War and eventually being forcibly removed from their homes under Andrew Jackson’s Indian Removal Act, Native American populations were diminished in size and territory by the end of the 19th century.

Below are events that shaped Native Americans’ tumultuous history following the arrival of foreign settlers.

Native American Cultures

1492: Christopher Columbus lands on a Caribbean Island after three months of traveling. Believing at first that he had reached the East Indies, he describes the natives he meets as “Indians.” On his first day, he orders six natives to be seized as servants.

April 1513: Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon lands on continental North America in Florida and makes contact with Native Americans.

February 1521: Ponce de Leon departs on another voyage to Florida from San Juan to start a colony. Months after landing, Ponce de Leon is attacked by local Native Americans and fatally wounded.

May 1539: Spanish explorer and conquistador Hernando de Soto lands in Florida to conquer the region. He explores the South under the guidance of Native Americans who had been captured along the way.

October 1540: De Soto and the Spaniards plan to rendezvous with ships in Alabama when they’re attacked by Native Americans. Hundreds of Native Americans are killed in the ensuing battle.

C. 1595: Pocahontas is born, daughter of Chief Powhatan.

1607: Pocahontas’ brother kidnaps Captain John Smith from the Jamestown colony. Smith later writes that after being threatened by Chief Powhatan, he was saved by Pocahontas. This scenario is debated by historians.

1613: Pocahontas is captured by Captain Samuel Argall in the first Anglo-Powhatan War. While captive, she learns to speak English, converts to Christianity and is given the name “Rebecca.”

1622: The Powhatan Confederacy nearly wipes out Jamestown colony.

1680: A revolt of Pueblo Native Americans in New Mexico threatens Spanish rule over New Mexico.

1754: The French and Indian War begins, pitting the two groups against English settlements in the North.

French and Indian War

May 15, 1756: The Seven Years’ War between the British and the French begins, with Native American alliances aiding the French.

May 7, 1763: Ottawa Chief Pontiac leads Native American forces into battle against the British in Detroit. The British retaliate by attacking Pontiac’s warriors in Detroit on July 31, in what is known as the Battle of Bloody Run. Pontiac and company successfully fend them off, but there are several casualties on both sides.

1785: The Treaty of Hopewell is signed in Georgia, protecting Cherokee Native Americans in the United States and sectioning off their land.

Chief Powhatan, also known as Wahunsenacawh, was born in the Chesapeake Bay region in the 1540s or 1550s. He became leader of more than 30 tribes and controlled the area where English colonists formed the Jamestown settlement in 1607. The marriage of his daughter Pocohantas to a colonist led to a peace that remained in effect when Powhatan died in April 1618. Chief Tamanend (est. 1628-1700), variously called Tammany, Temane, Taminent, was a Lenni-Lenape leader who welcomed British statesman William Penn upon his arrival in the Americas in 1682. Here, Penn (in dark coat) accepts a belt from Tamanend as part of treaty in which Penn purchased a section of land for the Pennsylvania Colony. Mohawk Chief Thayendanegea (1742-1807), also known by his English name, Joseph Brant, convinced four of the Six Nations to fight for the British in 1775, arguing that the British were more likely to uphold their land agreements with the Indians than the Americans. Brant fought with distinction in several major skirmishes in the New York area, rising to the rank of captain. Tecumseh (1768-1813) was a Shawnee chief from present-day Columbus, Ohio. During the early 1800s, he attempted to organize a confederation of tribes to resist white settlement. During the War of 1812, Tecumseh and his followers joined the British in the fight against the United States. He was killed in the Battle of the Thames in Canada on October 5, 1813. Sequoyah (c. 1778–1843) was a silversmith and artist who developed a system of Cherokee syllabary, making reading and writing in Cherokee possible. Sacagawea (c. 1788-1812) was a Shoshone woman who accompanied American explorers Lewis and Clark on their western expedition as an interpreter and guide. Her skills as a translator were invaluable, as was her intimate knowledge of difficult terrain. She is shown in this drawing by E.S. Paxson in 1810. Lakota Chief Red Cloud (1822–1909) was a key leader in 19th-century land battles between Native Americans and the U.S. government. He successfully resisted developments of the Bozeman trail through Montana territory and led the opposition against the development of a road through Wyoming and Montana for two years—a period that came to be known as Red Cloud's War. Geronimo (1829-1909) was an Apache leader and medicine man best known for his fearlessness in resisting anyone–Mexican or American—who attempted to remove his people from their tribal lands. He kneels with a rifle in his hands in this 1887 photograph. Sitting Bull (c. 1831-1890) was a Teton Dakota chief who united the Sioux tribes of the American Great Plains against white settlers who invaded Sioux land when gold was discovered in the Black Hills in the mid-1870s. Sitting Bull’s refusal to follow an 1875 order to bring his people to the Sioux reservation led to the Battle of the Little Bighorn, during which the Sioux and Cheyenne wiped out five troops of General Custer’s 7th Cavalry. Chief Joseph, born born Hinmuuttu-yalatlat, (1840-1904) was a Nez Perce chief who faced white settlement of tribal lands in Oregon and led his followers in an effort to escape to Canada. He was famously quoted as saying, ""My heart is sad and sick. From where the sun now stands, I will fight no more forever,"" upon his surrender in 1877. Crazy Horse (c. 1842–1877) was an Oglala Sioux chief who fought against removal to a reservation in the Black Hills. In 1876, he joined with Cheyenne forces in a surprise attack against Gen. George Crook; then united with Chief Sitting Bull in the Battle of the Little Bighorn. 1 / 11 : Getty Images / Kean Collection / Staff

May 28, 1830: President Andrew Jackson signs the Indian Removal Act, which gives plots of land west of the Mississippi River to Native American tribes in exchange for land that is taken from them.

1836: The last of the Muscogee (Creek) Native Americans leave their land for Oklahoma as part of the Indian removal process. Of the 15,000 Muscogees who make the voyage to Oklahoma, more than 3,500 don’t survive.

1838: With only 2,000 Cherokees having left their land in Georgia to cross the Mississippi River, President Martin Van Buren enlists General Winfield Scott and 7,000 troops to speed up the process by holding them at gunpoint and marching them 1,200 miles. More than 5,000 Cherokee die as a result of the journey. The series of relocations of Native American tribes and their hardships and deaths during the journey would become known as the Trail of Tears.

1851: Congress passes the Indian Appropriations Act, creating the Indian reservation system. Native Americans aren’t allowed to leave their reservations without permission.

October 1860: A group of Apache Native Americans attack and kidnap a white American, resulting in the U.S. military falsely accusing the Native American leader of the Chiricahua Apache tribe, Cochise. Cochise and the Apache increase raids on white Americans for a decade afterwards.

April 29, 1868: The U.S. Government and the Sioux Nation sign the Treaty of Fort Laramie. In this treaty, the United States recognizes the Black Hills of Dakota as the Great Sioux Reservation, the exclusive territory of the Sioux (Dakota, Lakota and Nakota) and Arapaho people. But after gold is discovered in the Black Hills, miners and settlers begin moving onto the land en masse. Native resistance to the treaty’s violation culminates in the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. In 1980, the Supreme Court rules that the Black Hills were illegally confiscated, and awards the Sioux more than $100 million in reparations. Sioux leaders reject the payment, saying the land had never been for sale.

Battle of the Little Bighorn

November 27, 1868: General George Armstrong Custer leads an early morning attack on Cheyenne living with Chief Black Kettle, destroying the village and killing more than 100 people, including many women and children and Black Kettle himself.

Custer and his troops are defeated and killed, increasing tensions between Native Americans and white Americans.

October 6, 1879: The first students attend Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania, the country’s first off-reservation boarding school. The school, created by Civil War veteran Richard Henry Pratt, is designed to assimilate Native American students.

In 1879, U.S. cavalry captain Richard Henry Pratt opened a boarding school in Pennsylvania called the Carlisle Indian Industrial School—a government-backed institution that forcibly separated Native American children from their parents in order to, as Pratt put it, “kill the Indian in him, and save the man.” Student Tom Torlino, upon his arrival to the Carlisle School.

June 2, 1924: U.S. Congress passes the Indian Citizenship Act, granting citizenship to all Native Americans born in the territorial limits of the country. Previously, citizenship had been limited, depending on what percentage Native American ancestry a person had, whether they were veterans, or, if they were women, whether they were married to a U.S. citizen.

Photographer Edward S. Curtis (1868-1952) spent over 30 years photographing over 80 tribes west of the Mississippi. In 1912, a show of his work was presented at the New York Public Library, and was later reprised in 1994 on the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus’s discovery of the Americas. The work features Curtis' photos, along with the photographer's notes (in italics), which he had written on the back of each print. Curtis's photographs command respect for a group of people that had been marginalized over the span of the 19th century. But the work has also been met with criticism. Some have argued the photos, many of which were staged, present a romanticized version of Native American life—by a white photographer.""The Blackfoot Medicine Lodge Encampment of the Summer of 1899."" ""A Blackfoot picture on the prairies of Montana. In the early days and closely following the acquisition of the horse, many of the Northern plains tribes carried their camp equipment on the Travaux.

Steil: Steil, delegation call for Evers to ban TikTok from state government devices","WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Bryan Steil (WI-01) joined alongside Rep. Mike Gallagher, Sen. Ron Johnson, and Reps. Glenn Grothman, Scott Fitzgerald, and Tom Tiffany, in sending a letter to Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers calling on the Governor to ban TikTok from Wisconsin government devices. They also called for Governor Evers, who has used TikTok in the past, to delete his TikTok account.

“TikTok presents clear national security risks. To protect Wisconsin’s government data and our personal data, we should not be using TikTok on government devices. Thank you Rep. Gallagher for leading this effort,” said Steil.

In part, the lawmakers wrote, “We write to urge you to ban TikTok from Wisconsin government devices and to lead by example and delete TikTok from your own devices. TikTok is nefarious Chinese Communist Party (CCP) spyware that surveils American citizens, promotes CCP propaganda, and allows the CCP to censor and control Americans’ news and content. The United States Congress and multiple Biden Administration officials have raised concerns about TikTok on national security grounds and even called for a ban. These concerns are not localized at the federal level—this affects the Wisconsin state government and Wisconsinites at large. As governor, you should prohibit this app from state government devices.”

To read the full text of the letter, click here, or read the text below.

Dear Governor Evers,

We write to urge you to ban TikTok from Wisconsin government devices and to lead by example and delete TikTok from your own devices. TikTok is nefarious Chinese Communist Party (CCP) spyware that surveils American citizens, promotes CCP propaganda, and allows the CCP to censor and control Americans’ news and content. The United States Congress and multiple Biden Administration officials have raised concerns about TikTok on national security grounds and even called for a ban. These concerns are not localized at the federal level—this affects the Wisconsin state government and Wisconsinites at large. As governor, you should prohibit this app from state government devices.

The CCP controls and directs TikTok. TikTok’s corporate owner, ByteDance, is a Chinese company and is therefore bound by Chinese law to assist CCP intelligence agencies. ByteDance’s editor-in-chief, Zhang Fuping, is a CCP member and chairs the company’s Communist Party Committee. In a September 2020 court filing, the Department of Justice described ByteDance’s founder and former CEO, Zhang Yiming, as a “mouthpiece for the CCP” and “committed to promoting the CCP’s agenda and messaging.” President Biden recognizes the threat posed by TikTok. In July 2020, he required all of his presidential campaign staff to delete TikTok from their work and personal phones.

TikTok is a CCP surveillance tool. It tracks cell phone users’ data, including user location data, and users’ keystrokes, even when not even using the app. The CCP can thus collect sensitive intelligence on Wisconsin government employees and even blackmail or pressure them based on this information.6 Just last month, Forbes reported that ByteDance planned to use TikTok to track specific Americans’ locations for a non-advertising purpose.

Even worse than its data collection, TikTok can use its black box algorithm to promote CCP propaganda and censor content. We have already seen TikTok censor references to the CCP’s genocide and reeducation camps in Xinjiang and the Tiananmen Square massacre and block the account of an American Muslim rights activist who criticized the CCP’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims before an outcry forced a reverse course. The concern with this algorithm is especially acute given the growing percentage of American adults who use TikTok as their news source. It is inappropriate for the CCP to curate Wisconsin government employees’ news feed.

It is not unprecedented for a state governor to ban TikTok on government devices. Last week, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem issued an Executive Order banning TikTok from the South Dakota state government devices of government employees, agencies, and contractors. We strongly urge you to follow Governor Noem’s lead and examine your own legal authorities to ban TikTok from Wisconsin state government devices.

We further request that you lead by example and immediately delete your own TikTok accounts. Wisconsinites expect their governor to be aware of the dangerous national security threats TikTok poses and to protect them from this avenue for CCP intelligence operations. Knowing the threats posed by CCP control of TikTok, it is irresponsible—at best—for a governor to ignore these risks and promote TikTok through his own use of the app.

If you do not intend to delete your TikTok account or to ban TikTok from government devices, please respond with an explanation of your decision. Thank you for your prompt attention to this vital national security matter",Q4
https://www.theepochtimes.com/how-delay-in-twitter-trial-could-benefit-elon-musk_4782724.html,How Delay in Twitter Trial Could Benefit Elon Musk,"Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen McCormick on Thursday stayed the legal battle between Elon Musk and Twitter Inc. until Oct. 28 to allow the two parties to close the deal.

Delving on the development, Future Fund analyst Gary Black suggested the deferral was to Musk’s advantage. The postponement of the trial date gives Musk more time to get the financing together, Black said.

Financial companies, including big Wall Street banks, are under pressure amid market uncertainties precipitated by a rising rate environment. Yields on bonds have shot up, creating distress in the credit market, which, in turn, has made it difficult for banks that have promised debt financing to resell the debt.

Secondly, the fund manager noted that the trading window for selling shares has been closed for Musk until Tesla Inc. reports its earnings on Oct. 19. If the billionaire needs to offload shares to close any funding gap, he can do it only after the earnings release, Black added.

This also gives Musk time to get more equity investors to invest in Twitter, Black said. Musk–Twitter Diverge McCormick mentioned in the ruling that Musk is optimistic about the deal closing on or around Oct. 28 but Twitter is not confident enough. The social media platform’s lawyers said they oppose the motion for the stay, reasoning that Musk’s agreement will not ensure the transaction will close fast enough.

Reacting to Twitter’s move, Musk’s lawyers argued in a filing that there was no need for an expedited trial to order the Tesla CEO what he is already doing.

“Yet, Twitter will not take yes for an answer. Astonishingly, they have insisted on proceeding with the litigation, recklessly putting the deal at risk and gambling with their stockholders’ interest, Musk’s team said in the filing.

The team also argued that proceeding toward the trial is not only an enormous waste of party and judicial resources but will also undermine the ability of the parties to close the transaction. The trial will be a distraction for Musk and team from working to secure the necessary financing and preparing for a transition of the business, it added.

“In effect, a trial would keep the merger transaction in limbo for longer, casting an unnecessary cloud of uncertainty over the company,” Musk’s lawyers said. Twitter Stock Under Pump Black said Twitter shares could fall further with more time until the deal closes. The stock, which ran up steeply in recent sessions in anticipation of the Musk reviving deal, slumped 3.72 percent to $49.39 on Thursday, according to Benzinga Pro data. It fell an incremental 1.90 percent in after-hours trading.

https://eia-international.org/news/us-chemical-giant-accused-by-eia-of-spreading-disinformation-to-prolong-the-use-of-harmful-refrigerants/,US chemical giant accused by EIA of spreading disinformation to prolong the use of harmful refrigerants,"EIA Climate campaigners today (6 December) accused US chemical giant Chemours of peddling spurious claims and disinformation to prevent the adoption of ambitious EU climate legislation that will further restrict the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases), a prominent part of the company’s portfolio.

Chemours’ paid-for advertorial F-gas solutions are critical to achieve our biggest environmental goals appeared in the highly influential digital newspaper Politico, which reports on the political affairs of the European Union (EU).

The EU is currently looking to strengthen climate legislation dealing with super polluting hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and other F-gases used widely in refrigeration, air-conditioning and heat pumps.

“The article is toxic greenwashing, full of spurious claims and misdirection, aimed at persuading European policymakers there are no alternatives to F-gases and deterring them from supporting an ambitious strengthening of the EU F-Gas Regulation,” said EIA UK Climate Campaign Leader Clare Perry.

The advertorial written by Alisha Bellezza, President of Thermal & Specialized Solutions at Chemours, argued that, among other things, F-gases are “superior alternatives for thermal management as they offer a unique combination of sustainability, safety and performance in critical applications.”

“That’s simply not true,” countered Perry. “The ‘superior alternatives’ offered by Chemours, known as hydrofluoro-olefins (HFOs), are not only energy- and resource-intensive to produce, they are prohibitively expensive for developing countries to use and contribute to emissions of by-product super greenhouse gases such as HFC-23.”

Ironically, the article’s publication coincides with the release of a ‘worst of the worst’ list of American industrial greenhouse gas emitters during 2021, the year in which Chemours recorded revenues of $6.3 billion.

The Chemours plant in Louisville, Kentucky was number four in the top seven worst offenders due to its emissions of HFC-23, a by-product from the manufacture of other F-gases.

According to the data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the plant emitted the equivalent of 2,664,089 tonnes of CO 2 –the estimated greenhouse gas emissions from more than half a million gasoline-powered cars being driven for a year.

Capturing and destroying HFC-23, based on proven technologies that have been available for decades, costs as little as a $0.2 per tonne of CO 2 e; preventing Chemours’ 2021 emissions would cost about $530,000, a mere 0.00008 per cent of its revenue.

Ms Bellezza also claimed that “the European Commission stated in its own assessment that propane is not a viable replacement for F-gases”.

“Well, the opposite is true,” said Perry. “The European Commission’s impact assessment states “today there are suitable alternatives to the use of F-gases with a very low climate impact in most sectors and applications. These include the so-called natural alternatives such as hydrocarbons (e.g. propane, butane, cyclopentane), ammonia, C0 2 or water”.”

Perry also took issue with Ms Bellezza resorting to scare tactics. In the advertorial, she detailed the “significant health risks” of using ammonia in cooling. However, the Chemours executive failed to acknowledge that ammonia is, and has been for decades, widely used as a highly efficient refrigerant in industrial refrigeration.

“Chemours and its former parent company Dupont have made a significant contribution to the hole in our ozone layer and to global warming through their invention of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other fluorochemicals. It can’t seem to get it right – its new so-called climate-friendly HFOs are anything but – their continued HFC-23 emissions are proof of that. And many of them are PFAS, the group of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances that several EU governments are looking to ban as they’re toxic ‘forever’ chemicals,” added Perry.

“Chemours claims that its gases help us to meet our climate and sustainability goals to secure a better tomorrow – but a better tomorrow is one that rapidly phases out F-gases.”

EIA asked Chemours how it squared Ms Bellezza extolling the virtues of F-gases in Politico with the emissions data reported by the US EPA, but has received no response to date.",Q4

Rosario Dawson will reprise her role as Ahsoka Tano alongside an ensemble that includes Eman Esfandi as Ezra Bridger, Natasha Liu Bordizzo as Sabin Wren, Hayden Christensen as Darth Vader, and Ray Stevenson, Ivanna Sakhno, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead in undisclosed roles.

The latter, who counts Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World among her many credits, joined the cast earlier this year, with speculation running rampant that she might be playing Hera Syndulla.

That character was spotted from behind in the teaser shown to fans at Star Wars Celebration and, according to a new report from Bespin Bulletin (via SFFGazette.com), the actress will indeed bring the animated character to life in Ahsoka. This is news which we're sure will be welcomed as Winstead is a great fit for the Rebel.

Hera Syndulla is a Twi'lek female, and the daughter of Cham Syndulla, who left her homeworld Ryloth to fight the Empire as a member of the crew of the Ghost in Star Wars Rebels. The here shared a strong connection with Kanan Jarrus, with whom she has a son, Jacen Syndulla, before Jarrus' death on Lothal.

An outstanding pilot, Hera served as call sign Spectre 2 with the crew of the Ghost, and she was later promoted to Captain of the Phoenix Squadron in the Rebel Alliance.

Hera has also appeared in The Bad Batch and Forces of Destiny, and had a key role in the Star Wars: Squadrons video game. She was voiced by actress Vanessa Marshall in all of those projects, though her not playing the character in live-action isn't a surprise based on past experience.

Shooting on Ahsoka is thought to have wrapped last month, and pretty much all the Ghost's crew are now confirmed to appear. There's been no word on Zeb yet, though we'd imagine Steve Blum will return to lend his voice to the formidable Lasat. As for Grand Adrmiral Thrawn, the crew's main foe, Lars Mikkelsen is still expected to reprise the role.

Ahsoka is set to premiere on Disney+ sometime in 2023.",Q4

https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/pakistans-lower-house-passes-forced-disappearances-bill-for-second-time-443780,Pakistan’s Lower House passes forced disappearances Bill for second time,"Islamabad, October 22

Pakistan’s Lower House of the Parliament has passed for the second time the Bill seeking to declare forced disappearances a heinous crime.

The Bill was passed on Friday after Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar agreed to withdraw the controversial Section 514 from the Criminal Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2022, which provided for punishment to those filing false complaints.

The Section was removed after a number of lawmakers, mostly belonging to the parties in the ruling coalition, had protested over it and refused to vote for the Bill in the present form, Dawn newspaper reported.

Commerce Minister Naveed Qamar, after Tarar’s statement, moved the amendment seeking to omit the controversial section from the bill aimed at criminalising enforced disappearances through amendments to the Pakistan Penal Code 1860 and the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898.

The omitted Section stated that “whoever files a complaint or gives information that proves to be false he or another person has been subjected to enforced, forced or involuntary disappearance or an attempt has been made in this regard, shall be guilty of an offence punishable up to five-year imprisonment and a fine of up to Rs 100,000”.

The Bill was later unanimously passed by the house which was once again clearly lacking quorum—for which the presence of 86 members (one-fourth of the total 342-member house) is required.

It was drafted by the previous Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government and piloted by former interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed.

The Lower House—National Assembly—had passed the Bill in November last year. However, the government needed to bring it back to the Assembly as the Senate—Upper House—had passed the Bill on Thursday with a few amendments.

The Senate is now again required to pass the Bill in order to make it an Act of Parliament.

The issue of forced disappearances has been in the headlines for years, especially in Balochistan, Karachi, and tribal regions where the security forces have been fighting against terrorists and rebels.

Besides this, the National Assembly also passed the Inter-Governmental Commercial Transactions Bill, 2022, aimed at encouraging foreign states to have economic and business relations with Pakistan.

The Lower House also passed a resolution condemning New Delhi ahead of the 75th anniversary of Jammu and Kashmir’s accession to India, according to Dawn.",Q4
https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/news/2022-12-20/some-republican-governors-in-the-mountain-west-have-banned-tiktok-from-state-devices,Some Republican governors in the Mountain West have banned TikTok from state devices,"News brief:

Republican governors in Idaho , Montana , Utah and Wyoming banned the popular app TikTok from all state electronic devices. That includes equipment like phones, laptops and tablets, and most states also prohibit the use of the app on state-run networks. The ban is a response to “cybersecurity concerns” due to TikTok’s Chinese ownership.

TikTok has tens of millions of users in the U.S. and surpassed one billion monthly active users globally last year. The Chinese company ByteDance owns the app, and the FBI said in November that it has “a number of concerns” about TikTok’s popularity.

In a press conference in mid-December, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said he’s worried the Chinese government could have access to user data the app stores.

“It's problematic for national security. It's deeply problematic for personal security. And of course, state security,” he said. “We cannot in good faith allow that app on state devices knowing that there is direct access to any data that may be stored there or inputted there.”

This move by states mirror efforts at the federal level. The U.S. Senate recently passed a bill that would ban federal employees from using TikTok on government-owned devices. Several agencies, including the military and Department of Homeland Security , already ban the app. At least 14 states have restrictions in place.

Cox said in addition to security concerns, the app is causing harm to young people.

“Not just the amount of time that you get kind of trapped on there, of course, but even worse than that,” he said. “When it comes to self harm videos, addiction videos, that can lead a person into a very dark and dangerous place.”

TikTok announced enhanced efforts to secure user data in the U.S. this month, but the company has previously acknowledged that non-U.S. employees have access to information on American users. Still, the company said these recent bans are “largely fueled by misinformation.”

Justin Gale Mata, 41, and Everett Justin Curtis, 48, pleaded guilty to providing the drugs that killed Brian M. Parrish, a firefighter with Cal Fire in San Diego County. Mata received a 15-year sentence, while Curtis was sentenced to 12 years and seven months.

According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, text messages showed Curtis and Parrish discussed the drug purchase on Jan. 30, 2021, then drove together to a casino to meet Mata, who sold Parrish the fentanyl.

Parrish died the following morning at the age of 43.

An online memorial for Parrish from Cal Fire San Diego County Firefighters Local #2881 states Parrish began his fire service career in 2014 with the United States Forest Service.

The following year, he became a reserve firefighter with San Diego County Fire and became a Cal Fire firefighter two years later. He worked at Fire Station 20 until his death and was described as “an integral part of the fire station and crew.”

Parrish also left behind his parents, sisters, three children, a grandchild, and his fiance.

https://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/health/more-states-offer-health-coverage-to-immigrant-children/article_77adeb50-46cb-5528-9cb6-334c9056f4d0.html,More states offer health coverage to immigrant children,"A small but growing number of states are extending government health benefits to children regardless of their immigration status.

Come January, Connecticut and New Jersey will join the nine states plus Washington, D.C., that already allow children without permanent legal status to enroll in either Medicaid, the public health plan for residents with lower incomes, or in its sister program, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP.

The change is costing the states millions of dollars. Although the federal government usually pays for at least half the cost of those programs, the states extending health benefits to kids lacking permanent legal status do so without receiving any federal money.

Despite the cost, momentum is growing: Connecticut, Maine, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Vermont passed legislation in the past two years extending the coverage, part of a larger effort to insure more children. The pandemic gave extra urgency to their push.

Maine included pregnant women in its legislation passed last year. State Sen. Anne Carney, a Democrat who championed the extension, said financial concerns should not justify leaving any children or pregnant women without access to health care. The change will cost the state $1.5 million a year, according to budget documents.

“They are kids living in Maine and going to school in Maine and like their peers who were born in Maine or born in the U.S. or have citizenship status, they all have the same health needs,” Carney said in an interview. “And there is no policy reason to differentiate between two kids sitting next to each other in school.”

But no state led by Republicans, who tend to favor tighter limits on immigration and oppose the expansion of safety net programs, has approved such legislation.

Some critics say the move unfairly rewards people living in the country illegally. Jessica M. Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors tighter immigration restrictions, said it is unfair to immigrants who follow the rules to provide benefits to those who are not here legally. She says it is unfair as well to employers who follow the law.

If taxpayers pay for health care for those here illegally, she wrote in an email, “in effect that is a subsidy to the employers of illegal workers, who can more easily get away with paying illegal workers below-subsistence wages, knowing that taxpayers will cover the gap between the low wages and what the workers need to support their families.”

She added that by “offering these benefits, states are putting out the welcome mat for illegal immigrants, and citizens and legal immigrants have to foot the bill.”

Supporters of extending coverage say such arguments lack compassion, depriving children of preventive health care, while ignoring public health lessons learned most recently during the COVID-19 pandemic. Assuring the health of immigrants, whether they are in the country legally or not, helps keep the overall population healthy.

“The fact that states independently are covering children is not necessarily based on politics but the realization that having a healthy population is a benefit to states themselves,” said Valerie Lacarte, senior policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that favors more legal immigration and other policy changes to discourage individual border crossings in search of asylum.

According to a June report Lacarte authored, of the estimated 2.3 million foreign-born children under 19 years old who by family income were eligible for Medicaid or CHIP in 2019, 909,000 were barred from those programs as a result of their immigration status.

About 43% of them, or nearly 391,000, were uninsured, according to the institute. That compares with 6% of U.S.-born children who were uninsured, the institute says.

In 1993, Massachusetts became the first state to extend health benefits to children without permanent legal status, Lacarte said. More states followed in the 2000s, particularly recently. They include California, Illinois, New York, Oregon, Washington and Washington, D.C.

In all those states, each with Democratic-led legislatures, the bills often have been part of overall efforts to ensure that as many children in the state, immigrant or otherwise, have health insurance. Those actions include eliminating premiums, increasing income eligibility levels and lessening red tape in renewing coverage.

“We’re trying to make sure all kids in New Jersey are covered,” said Democratic state Sen. Joseph Vitale, chair of the Senate Health, Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee and sponsor of the measure. “Kids are kids, and they deserve to have access to health care like the rest of us regardless of immigration status.”

In New Jersey, which will enroll kids lacking permanent legal status starting in January, the additional cost to the state, as well as other changes the legislature adopted to increase the enrollment of children in health insurance, is estimated at up to $15 million a year.

States always have had the choice of providing health care to immigrants living in the country illegally. For immigrants with temporary legal status, however, rules have changed over the years.

Until 1996, immigrants living legally in the United States had the same access as citizens to Medicaid and many other federally funded entitlement programs, Lacarte said, as long as they otherwise qualified, which typically meant meeting income eligibility requirements.

But Congress established a five-year waiting period for many immigrants with legal status before they could be eligible for Medicaid and CHIP. Some immigrants were exempted from the five-year requirement — asylum-seekers and refugees, for example — but most green-card holders were subject to the waiting period.

Congress in 2009 allowed states to waive the five-year waiting period in Medicaid and CHIP for most legally authorized immigrant children. And if they chose that option, the states could still qualify for federal matching funds to cover those immigrant enrollees.

A large majority of states elected the new option. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, as of January, 34 states plus Washington, D.C., waive the five-year waiting period to enroll legally residing immigrant children in their Medicaid and CHIP programs. Twenty-four states and Washington, D.C., do the same for legally residing pregnant women.

States also can seek federal matching Medicaid funds for emergency health care provided to children in families with low incomes regardless of their immigration status.

Carney, the Maine senator, said it’s time for the federal government to end patchwork policies at both the state and federal government. “I would very strongly argue for the federal match for everyone,” she said.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11521651/Juul-agrees-pay-1-2-bln-youth-vaping-settlement-Bloomberg-News.html,Juul agrees to pay $1.2 bln in massive youth-vaping settlement,"Juul has agreed to pay more than a billion dollars to settle thousands of lawsuits claiming it has fueled America's youth vaping epidemic.

The e-cigarette maker has been accused of getting a generation of Americans hooked on nicotine through its fruity- and candy-flavored e-cigarettes.

Juul will pay $1.2 billion to settle about 5,000 claims from 10,000 plaintiffs in a watershed moment that could spark similar legal battles against other vape manufacturers.

The sweeping settlement comes just a few months after the company was ordered to pay nearly $440 million to settle a two-year investigation by 33 states into its marketing tactics.

Juul has resolved more than 5,000 lawsuits across multiple districts in a California federal court this week following years of scandal over its role in fueling a youth vaping crisis

More than 2.5 million US children use e-cigarettes - rising a half-million from last year and reversing downward trends in recent years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) reports that 2.55 million Americans in middle or high school admit using the device in the past 30 days. It is a jump of 500,000, or of 24 per cent, from 2021. It is the first increase since the CDC started gathering annual data in 2019

A company spokesperson said this week: 'These settlements represent a major step toward strengthening Juul Labs’ operations and securing the company’s path forward to fulfill its mission to transition adult smokers away from combustible cigarettes while combating underage use.'

The Food and Drug Administration temporarily banned Juul from keeping its products on the US market.

But the agency has placed a temporary hold on its initial decision while Juul files an appeal - as it argues its products are a safer smoking alternative than cigarettes for adults.

The mountain of lawsuits against Juul were brought by school districts, parents of Juul users, city governments, and Native American tribes that have all been impacted by what they allege constitutes predatory marketing to teens.

In announcing its major legal win, the San Francisco Unified School District Superintendent Dr Matt Wayne said: 'This settlement represents a very positive outcome that will amplify the efforts of our health education staff and benefit SFUSD’s students by helping to reduce and deter youth nicotine use.'

The settlement money will be divvied up and awarded to the plaintiffs.

Juul upended the tobacco market in the late 2010s by hooking youth with high-nicotine pods in flavors such as mint and creme brulee. Three years after its market debut in 2015, the FDA launched a probe into underage sales of Juul products, setting the company and the government up for a contentious back and forth.

What do the recent studies on e-cigarettes say? People who vape experience 'worrisome changes' in their blood pressure Vaping causes your blood pressure and heart rate to spike immediately afterwards, a study claimed. University of Wisconsin experts found vaping and smoking cause people's heart rates to spike 15 minutes after use and put the body in 'fight or flight' mode. The study, presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2022, looked at data for 395 participants — 164 vapers, 117 smokers and 114 who had no history of nicotine, e-cigarette or tobacco use. Co-lead author Matthew Tattersall, an assistant professor of medicine at the university, said: 'Immediately after vaping or smoking, there were worrisome changes in blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability and blood vessel tone (constriction).' But the study has not been peer-reviewed and was only observational, so researchers could not prove vapes were actually causing the heart issues. E-cigarette users are less fit than people who do not vape Vapers perform worse when exercising than non-smokers and are more akin to smokers, a study claims. Researchers looked at data from the same participants as the previous study. After 90 minutes on the machine, they were given four heart screenings to determine overall health of the organ. People who vaped scored 11 per cent lower than those who did not use nicotine. Smokers had test scores 16 per cent lower than the control group. Dr Aruni Bhatnagar, a professor of Medicine at the University of Louisville said: 'These studies add to the growing body of science that shows similar cardiovascular injury among people who use e-cigarettes and those who smoke combustible cigarettes.' Vaping is 'just as bad as cigarettes for your heart' Vapers are at the same risk of heart disease as cigarette users, according to US federally-funded research. In two studies, one on mice and one on people, e-cigarettes were found to cause similar damage to blood vessels as smoking tobacco. The findings from experts at the University of California, San Francisco were published in the American Heart Association’s journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology (ATVB). Despite the difference in ingredients that make up e-cigarette aerosol and cigarette smoke, the researchers found that blood vessel damage does not appear to be caused by a specific component of cigarette smoke or e‑cigarette vapor. Rather, it appears to be caused by airway irritation which triggers biological signals in the valgus nerve. Dr Matthew Springer, a professor of medicine in the division of cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco said: 'We were surprised to find that there was not a single component that you could remove to stop the damaging effect of smoke or vapors on the blood vessels.' 'As long as there’s an irritant in the airway, blood vessel function may be impaired,' he said. Advertisement

Then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb called youth vaping an epidemic in September 2018.

Two months later, Juul pull all flavors from the market except for tobacco, mint and menthol.

Meanwhile, Juul surged in popularity, dominating over 70 per cent of the US e-cigarette market in October 2018. A formal investigation by Congress into Juul's marketing tactics in the summer of 2019 eventually led CEO Kevin Burns to issue an apology to parents of teens who were addicted to the company's vaping products.

The company, however, has not admitted any wrongdoing.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated in October that nearly 2.6 million high school and middle school students, or 14 per cent of all American children between sixth and 12th grade, currently use e-cigarettes.

While high, the latest figures are a far cry from the 5.4million youth users in 2019 - about eight per cent of children - when restrictions on the devices' sale and the pandemic cut into vaping.

This marks a jump of 500,000, or of 24 per cent, from 2021. It is the first increase since 2019.

But its role in hooking millions of teens made Juul public health enemy number one for a time, with high-level government officials pushing for all-out e-cigarette flavor bans and caps on nicotine content.

Amid widespread backlash, Juul dropped all US advertising and discontinued most of its flavors in 2019.

London, co-lead counsel for plaintiffs in the federal litigation said this week: 'These settlements will put meaningful compensation in (the) hands of victims and their families, get real funds to schools for abatement programs, and help government and tribal entities prevent youth use of e-cigarettes across the US.'

This is not the first costly settlement Juul has reached this year. In September, the San Francisco company agreed to pay nearly $440 million to settle a two-year investigation by 33 states into the marketing of its high-nicotine vaping products.

Juul has also settled with 37 states and territories over the last year and said it´s in ongoing talks with other key stakeholders to resolve remaining litigation.

Other brands of vapes are not immune. Manufacturers like Puff Bar, a disposable product, have also been targeted for marketing flavored products in violation of state laws.

Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey sued Puff Bar in 2020 for violating a 2019 state ban on flavored vape liquids, which she alleged the company was making easily available to minors.

While e-cigarettes are relatively new and long-term health effects have not been quantified yet, their use has been linked to lung damage, high blood pressure and constricted arteries, long-term addiction, and mental health issues such as anxiety.

A recent US study found vaping and smoking cause people's heart rates to spike 15 minutes after use and put the body in 'fight or flight' mode.

In a second study, researchers carried out a series of cardiovascular tests after getting participants to run on a treadmill for 90 minutes.

Those who smoked or vaped performed significantly worse on all metrics, including how quickly heart rate recovered after exercise and how hard the heart had to work at peak levels.",Q4

Bryan Christopher Kohberger, 28, of Chestnuthill was arrested Friday morning on charges he stabbed the four students to death last month. Kohberger is a graduate student at Washington State University, and is being held in Monroe County jail pending extradition to Idaho on a warrant charging first-degree murder.

During the news conference, Bill Thompson, Latah County prosecutor, said Kohberger is charged with four counts of first-degree murder and with felony burglary, “for entering a residence with the intent to commit the crime of murder.”

The Idaho students — Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin — were stabbed to death early Nov. 13 at a rental home near campus.

A handout photo provided by Monroe County jail shows Bryan Kohberger, 28, who is being held for extradition in the criminal homicide investigation in the killings of four University of Idaho students.

Why can’t Moscow police share more details of the crime?

During the news conference, Moscow police Chief James Fry said while some information was kept hidden until now to avoid tipping off suspects before they were arrested, there is a great deal of information that Idaho law enforcement can’t share due to state Supreme Court rules.

Bill Thompson, the Latah County prosecutor, said the Idaho Supreme Court has placed restrictions on pretrial publicity, which prevents them from going into details of the investigation or the case against Kohberger. Thompson said more information about the crime and what led to Kohberger’s arrest is sealed in a probable cause affidavit that won’t be opened until Kohberger appears in person before a court in Idaho.

“We will continue to provide as much information as we can as the process moves forward,” Fry said.

Police received thousands of tips

Fry thanked the community, other law enforcement agencies, people around the country and news media for assistance in bringing in information for the investigation.

“I want to express my appreciation for our local community, the people of Idaho and those throughout our nation, who provided information to help us investigate these murders, has been very impressive. We’ve received over 19,000 tips and we’ve conducted over 300 interviews,” Fry said.

However, Fry also said the investigation is far from over and Moscow Police Department is still looking for tips or information related to this crime and about Kohberger.

“Report anything you know about him to help investigators and our office and the court system understand everything there is to know about the individual, and what happened and why,” Fry said.

What comes next?

Kohberger is going to remain jailed in Pennsylvania without bail until some point next week. An extradition hearing for Kohberger is set for 3:30 p.m. Tuesday in Monroe County before Judge Margherita P. Worthington.

The hearing will determine the time and manner in which Kohberger is transported to Idaho. Thompson said Kohberger can waive extradition and return voluntarily to the state of Idaho, or initiate extradition proceedings. Thompson said it could take weeks for him to arrive in the state.

“I’m asking for your patience and understand that’s just the way the system works,” Thompson said.

What we do, and don’t know about case

Fry was able to confirm a some details. A white Hyundai Elantra seen near the Idaho students’ home around the time of the killings was key to police breaking the case open, and Fry said they had such a car. He said they are still looking for the murder weapon.

Police have said that those killed were likely asleep when they were attacked, some had defensive wounds, and each was stabbed multiple times. There was no sign of sexual assault. Police were dispatched the next morning to the scene after one of the surviving residents of the house called 911 when they found an unconscious body.

Few other details, including possible motives and the exact events of the grisly killings, are available at this time.

Fry also couldn’t answer whether there were any other suspects, and could not discuss what relationship Kohberger may have had with the slain students before the incident.

Community still in shock

Fry acknowledged the ongoing pain the murders have inflicted on the community.

“These murders have shaken our community and no arrest will ever bring back these young students,” he said.

Moscow is a college town with roughly 25,000 residents. A significant portion of the University of Idaho’s students chose to finish the semester online rather than return in person.

Scott Green, president of the University of Idaho, said a great deal of compassion was shown, including from the office of Idaho Gov. Brad Little, which promised funds for the campus.

“We are truly thankful for the compassion and acts of kindness shown to our community,” Green said. “Kindness is contagious and it provided the light that reclaimed ground lost to evil and darkness.”

https://961theeagle.com/man-wanted-for-murder-in-nyc-nabbed-in-utica-robbery-investigation/,Man Wanted for NYC Murder Nabbed in Utica Robbery Investigation,"A man arrested by Utica Police in connection with their investigation into a possible robbery will be extradited to New York City where he is being sought on a murder charge.

That's according to Utica Police who say they encountered the man while responding to a call about a robbery on the 1100 block of Mohawk Street. Officers said they saw a man wear clothes that matched those of the suspect. When they stopped him, the man told officers his name was John Carter and also gave them his birthday, police said. A check of that information in a police database returned a match for a John Carter with the same DOB who was wanted on warrant for a charge of murder in New York City, police said.

Police believe it's the same man based on a photo of Carter in the state database.

He was arrested without incident and UPD said he would be held pending extradition to NYC. Cops also said their investigation into the robbery is ongoing. Thus far, Carter has not been charged in that incident.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/documents-detail-scramble-to-protect-ambassador-bridge-windsor-detroit-tunnel-from-protests-1.6624581,"Documents detail scramble to protect Ambassador Bridge, Windsor-Detroit tunnel from protests","The Windsor Police Service, the City of Windsor and Mayor Drew Dilkens were aware of an organized effort to block the Ambassador Bridge in the southwestern Ontario city in February and started to make arrangements before it was shut down, according to newly released documents.

Those preparations included requests for additional officers from LaSalle and Chatham-Kent for a two-week deployment, inquiring if the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel could be used for truck traffic and searching for concrete jersey barriers to protect the tunnel crossing, the documents reveal. They were tabled this week as part of the ongoing inquiry examining the federal government's decision to invoke the Emergencies Act to deal with convoy rallies in Windsor, Ottawa and other cities to protest pandemic mandates.

Notes from closed meetings that now have been made public also highlight what Windsor police considered ""trigger points"" for moving in on the protest and concerns about a ""radical faction"" among the protesters.

The Public Order Emergency Commission (POEC) in Ottawa is working to determine whether the government's decision to invoke the Emergencies Act to evict the protesters was justified.

The act went into effect the morning the Ambassador Bridge opened, following a week-long protest that blocked North America's busiest international border crossing.

Hundreds of protesters blocked the entrance and exit of the bridge on Feb. 7, mainly with personal vehicles and a couple of transport trucks.

This came following weeks of so-called ""slow roll"" protests under the Freedom Convoy banner, and included people who were against government pandemic mandates that limited who could cross the bridge into Canada and the United States.

Feb. 4: 3 days before blockade

The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) alerted the City of Windsor's chief executive officer of the Windsor-Detroit Tunnel Corporation (WDTC) on the Friday morning before the protest, to warn about a possible blockade.

""While there is no information that I have been made aware of regarding protests at the tunnel, if any such blockade occurs at the Ambassador Bridge, we may see an increase in passenger traffic and those commercial vehicles that are able to utilize the tunnel,"" wrote the CBSA's Darrin Boismier to Carolyn Brown of the WDTC.

That afternoon, Brown forwarded the email to Windsor's chief administrative officer (CAO) and Andrew Ray, an alias Dilkens uses for his city email account.

Brown also advised the city that most trucks wouldn't be able to use the tunnel because of its height.

Dilkens also texted Minister of Public Safety Marco Mendicino to let him know police were ""preparing for a potential return of individuals who may attempt to block the bridge,"" according to a timeline of key events related to the blockade submitted to the commission.

Feb. 5: 2 days before blockade

The documents also reveal details about the early police plans to secure concrete jersey barriers ahead of a potential blockade, the same pieces of equipment the city used to block the length of Huron Church Road once the protesters left.

Windsor police Insp. Jennifer Crosby wrote to the City of Windsor's executive director of operations in the early evening on Saturday, asking for barricades ""on short notice to assist us in managing whatever we may be faced with in regards to the protests.""

Shanwa Boakes replied to say the city ""only has a couple available,"" but contractors might be able to help secure more.

According to the city's timeline of events, Pam Mizuno, the police chief at the time, and Windsor fire department Chief Stephen Laforet met about the potential blockade, with Laforet asking for updates from Mizuno in his role as the city's emergency management co-ordinator.

Feb. 6: Day before the blockade

Late Sunday night, Brown inquired with Transit Windsor executive director Tyson Cragg about a request from Dilkens ""to make alternative transportation arrangements for the medical staff who use the tunnel to get to work, in the event that the truck convoy tries to block the tunnel.""

""I'm advised the plan is to station a Transit Windsor bus on the Windsor Tunnel Plaza in the Duty Free Shop parking lot,"" wrote Brown.

But Cragg replied to say the plan likely wouldn't work.

""At this point, we need some easing of the re-entry restrictions on the Canadian side to make this work,"" wrote Cragg.

""We are standing by at the ready in the event we can make this work!""

Feb. 7: Day of blockade

In a morning meeting, a convoy-specific Community Control Group (CCG) made up of senior officials across emergency services in Windsor was told by Mizuno that protesters up to this point ""have been very compliant, not blocking intersections and leaving a lane free.""

But there was a warning that ""this is a different group coming,"" and discussions turned to preparations and possible response, including barricades and towing.

Emails exchanged between the CBSA and WDTC suggest that group was meeting in Comber and would head to the bridge at 10 a.m. ET.

That afternoon, the Canadian exit of the Ambassador Bridge was blocked by protesters, who parked a transport truck and personal vehicles in the southbound lane of Huron Church, and they remained in place until Friday afternoon.

Protesters 'cordial,' but 'radical faction' exists: deputy chief

Then deputy chief and now Acting Chief Jason Bellaire oversaw the police response at the blockade, according to notes from a closed-door meeting of the Windsor Police Services Board that was held 24 hours after the Ambassador Bridge was shut down.

That afternoon, Bellaire requested additional officers from Chatham-Kent and LaSalle.

A total of 11 officers were sent: 10 from Chatham-Kent and one from LaSalle.

Bellaire wrote in response to a question about how long the officers would be deployed that ""we would like to at least plan for the next 14 days"" and the protest had been ""mostly non-confrontational with a couple of contentious moments"" the first night of the blockade.

""Interestingly, the majority of the protesters to this point have not really been from any anti-police pedigree. It is somewhat cordial,"" he wrote.

However, that night at the police board meeting, Bellaire noted ""radical factions do exist in the group,"" according to meeting notes.

Bellaire said ""every police action will have a strong reaction,"" adding the police response would focus on diplomacy and negotiation.

""Any escalation has to be calculated... physical escalation will be a last resort.""

Dilkens, who chairs the police board, said Mizuno was submitting a request to the federal and provincial governments for 100 additional officers.

In a later meeting of the CCG, Chief Laforet raised the Windsor Regional Hospital's fears of a potential blockade at the Windsor-Detroit tunnel, which staff use to commute to work.

Bellaire said they were not aware of any plans by protesters to block the hospital or tunnel, but added that kind of action would change police tactics.

""Closing down access for emergency access is a trigger for a police response,"" Bellaire said, according to the notes.

""People that obstruct emergency access we take very seriously, and that steps outside the silo of negotiations on opening up traffic at the border.""

During that same meeting, Brown noted the Department of Homeland Security in the United States had a tentative plan in place to protect the tunnel.

Protesters never moved to the tunnel. Days later, an influx of police officers with the Ontario Provincial Police and RCMP arrived and they would enforce an injunction granted by a judge to remove protestors.

A total of 88 charges were laid against 44 people and multiple vehicles were towed away.

6:40 p.m.: Update on disruption in West Asheville

Joel Burgess reports:

Police have confirmed they responded to a disruption at a West Asheville polling site where a witness told the Citizen Times a man harassed voters and got into a serious verbal altercation.

Asheville Police Department spokesperson Samantha Booth said someone not involved in the disruption called 911.

“I can confirm a report was made by a third party reporting a verbal disruption between a voter and campaigners had occurred outside of the voting precinct. When officers arrived on scene the involved parties were no longer present,” Booth told the Citizen Times.

Bo Hess, a former Democratic congressional candidate, was at the polling site and said the man returned to the polling site a few times and circled in his truck.

6:30 p.m.: 'Every vote matters'

In the afternoon at the Wesley Grant Southside Center, Amy Alday was entering the polling site south of downtown.

Alday, who tends to vote for Democrats, declined to name any candidates she was supporting but told reporter Joel Burgess she likely would likely vote for Democratic candidates. Asked if there was a particular issue that brought her to the polls, Alday said that in this election in particular “we are hearing that every vote matters.”

Rogers Masson, an Army veteran, said he voted a straight Democratic ballot and agreed with many of the party’s policies but also said he was concerned about partisanship and political polarization.

People’s assumptions about each other are one of the major hurdles to calm, civic engagement, Masson said.

“And as a military veteran and with my background, you would probably pin me in one way politically, which I think is also a big problem in our country.”

5:50 p.m.: 'A lot is at stake'

Sarah Honosky reports:

At Calvary Baptist Church, the trickle of voters was slow, but steady. Dale Murphy, 31, was among those to cast her ballot at the West Asheville church.

""It just feels like a really important election, I feel like a lot is at stake,"" Murphy said.

Women’s rights, and the right to bodily autonomy, was her top issue, she said. Cheri Beasley, Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, was “a big one” that brought her out to vote, as well as Kim Roney for mayor.

“She seems like she’ll do something different,” Murphy said of Roney. When reflecting on the way the city handled the summer of 2020 and the Black Lives Matter protests downtown, she said she trusted Roney more, ""to see what she does that's new.""

5:38 p.m.: Bemoaning the ads

By 3:30 p.m. at Ira B. Jones Elementary, voter turnout was steady, poll workers told reporter Andrew Jones. A total 381 people had showed up to vote, including attorney Brent Smith and his 8-year-old son, Everett.

Everett Smith, holding a fistful of Lego pieces, recounted a political ad he’d heard on his iPad.

“What are the commercials you’ve basically memorized?” Brent Smith asked his son. “What’s the one about Ted?”

Quietly, Everett Smith repeated, “Ted Bud screwed farmers.”

“Political ads are absolutely ridiculous,” Brent Smith said. “There's a lot of stuff that unfortunately, parents have to explain to kids, because they're seeing all this. And you know, it's on, you know, primetime TV. It's on YouTube.

“Quite frankly, he knew more about the national elections than I did early on, based on the ads, a lot of issues that were pretty much over your head, right,” the 43-year-old father said. Brent Smith also has a 10-year-old daughter whom his wife brought to vote.

“That's something we do. We vote,” Smith said. “We believe it's important, even if we don't want to.

Smith’s brother is a veteran. He said his family believes that a lot of people sacrifice to allow U.S. citizen a voice at the polls.

Smith said affordable housing stood out to him and when asked, didn’t mention any candidates, but did bring up the $70 million in bonds Buncombe County wants to borrow and has put that decision to the residents in the form of a referendum.

Smith said he felt like there wasn’t enough information about the measure, however.

“I just don't feel like there was enough information put out,” he said. “I don't feel like there's a lot of information on what the money would actually be going toward. … Housing is a huge issue here in Buncombe County. It is everywhere in the country. There’s a lot of good intention out there I just don’t know if anyone has a good direction on how to solve the problem.”

5:30 p.m.: 'This is about the babies'

News-Record & Sentinel's Johnny Casey reports:

Monica Buckner-Olnhausen, a Madison County District 02 school board candidate, was on hand at the North Marshall precinct.

She said she feels the candidates have been cordial with one another throughout the entire process, and the county's Republican Party is particularly close, as the candidates plan to meet at the Madison County Republican Party headquarters.

""We're all running together,"" Buckner-Olnhausen said. ""I like everybody on this side, and I like most of them on the other side. My uncle (Jackie Lunsford, Madison County Democratic Party chair) is sitting right over there. So, this is not about politics. This is about the babies.""

5:26 p.m.: Beasley draws support

Tyson and Kathie Miller, at the Lucy Herring precinct, told reporter Sarah Honosky that they were drawn out to the polls by U.S. Senate candidate Cheri Beasley’s message.

“Like every year, it’s our civic duty,” Tyson Miller said of casting his ballot. “We want to have people in office that represent our views. Open minded and tolerant people that are unity oriented, that’s what we’re trying to push for.”

Kathie Miller said she was also driven by mayoral candidate and sitting council member Kim Roney. Of all current council members, she said Roney is the one that has made her feel heard.

“I really appreciate her the last few years,” she said. “I’ve written to her, and I’ve written to all the people, she’s the only one that writes back and takes the time. I was blown away by her ability to connect to people and really listen to them on issues.”

5:20 p.m.: Report of harassment in West Asheville

Joel Burgess reports:

A person at one polling site in West Asheville harassed voters and campaign workers, drawing the attention of several police officers, according to a former congressional candidate who was present.

The man came to the West Asheville Library polling site more than once and stood in line with voters, said former Democratic 11th District candidate Bo Hess who was at the site campaigning for some City Council candidates. Hess spoke with the Citizen Times in the late afternoon.

“He was in line harassing people,” said Hess, adding the man then got into a serious-looking verbal altercation in the parking lot. Hess, who is a social worker, said he stepped toward the two when the man began to curse at him, adding, “It was very threatening.”

The man drove off in a white pickup, circled the polling site and came back. Hess said he went to the police substation next door and alerted officers, several of whom came to an area near the site.

A Buncombe County elections spokesperson confirmed there was an incident, calling it a “disruption outside of the voting precinct between a voter and campaigners.”

“Library staff, not Elections staff, called 911. The voter involved left the location before police arrived,” said spokesperson Lillian Govus. “While no disruption occurred inside the voting enclosure, the chief judge will submit an incident report.”

The 911 call was made around 3 p.m., Govus said.

The Citizen Times has reached out to Asheville Police Department spokesperson Samantha Booth.

5:15 p.m.: Local races are important

Andrew Mastriani and Briar Buchanan, 44 and 29 respectively, told reporter Andrew Jones at North Asheville’s Unitarian Universalist Congregation that they voted for Kim Roney for Asheville mayor. They said they also came out to support school candidates like Pepi Acebo for Asheville City School Board — they have a child in the school system — and Allison Scott for Asheville City Council.

“I think she's an important voice in the community as a trans woman,"" Buchanan said. “And I was really excited about the amount of diversity on the ballot this time around. And I personally feel ready for a new mayor. So I was really excited not to vote for Esther Manheimer.”

Buchanan, who works as a real estate lawyer, said she voted for Roney and felt like many of the candidates had “really awesome platforms” regarding affordable housing.

“Our biggest issue in Asheville right now is affordable housing,” Mastriani said.

For people who are still on the fence about voting, Mastriani noted the importance of local races.

“Your vote has an impact locally, on local issues,” He said. “If you're paying attention to what's important to you and your community, I absolutely think that these this type of election is one of the most crucial ones for you to be active in.”

Buchanan agreed.

“I think Asheville is a great microcosm because I feel like we've done a really good job: People radicalize, and if they are unhappy with someone like we vote them out,” she said.

5:04 p.m.: Buncombe voter count update

From a news release:

As of 4 p.m., 30,762 voters turned out in Buncombe County, bringing the in-person voter total to 101,133. During early voting, 70,371 voters cast their ballots. At this time, 6,474 absentee-by-mail ballots have been processed, and they will continue to be processed through the canvass period. Voting has gone smoothly at the county’s 80 precincts.

5 p.m.: Excited for Beasley

From reporter Sarah Honosky:

Jessica Starkey, 21, said she voted all blue when she cast her ballot at Lucy S. Herring Elementary School in West Asheville.

She was most excited to put her support behind U.S. Senate Democratic candidate Cheri Beasley, and said she was impressed watching her campaign across North Carolina counties in the lead up to the election.

“I’m so excited for her,” Starkey said.

4:52 p.m.: Many issues matter

Russ Moxley told reporter Christian Smith that he came out to vote at New Hope Presbyterian Church, but he is not a ""one-issue voter,"" he said.

Moxley said he votes for who he thinks is best for each position instead of voting down ballot for one party or the other. This year, he said he voted primarily Democrat because those candidates' platforms happened to fit what he believes.

4:45 p.m.: Music to Fletcher's ears

Andrew Jones reports:

At North Asheville’s Unitarian Universalist Congregation 281 people had voted by about 2:45 p.m., a large turnout according to poll workers who served at the location in the past. One said 281 in past years was equal to the amount of people who showed up at the location by closing.

There, Stephan Pruitt, a 34-year-old photographer, showed up to vote local.

This year was personal for Pruitt, who said he know Asheville City Council candidate Andrew Fletcher.

“I’ve followed Andrew for a while,” Pruitt said. “I think he is doing a lot of stuff kind of promoting a lot of the low income housing.

Pruitt said he wasn’t “super political” and described himself as “pretty agnostic.” But, he said, he’s known Fletcher for a long time.

“He's a musician in town,” Pruitt said. “He's worked a lot of the same venues and stuff. And I think he really does feel like it's important to be more of a person for the people and like not just unfettered tourism growth. It's kind of more of a smart approach to that kind of thing. And the low income housing is a big thing for people: (it is) focused on locals who want to still be able to live here in town and work here in town. And I think that's a big thing that people really aren't looking at. As someone who grew up here, it's nuts trying to buy a house right now. I'm self-employed. I feel like I make a good living. And I'm just like, ‘Man, what is going on?’”

He also supported Asheville mayor candidate Kim Roney, noting Esther Manheimer had been around for a while and he felt “very middle-of-the-road” about her.

“We need a little bit of more hard lines with that kind of like unfettered growth that's going on,” Pruitt said. He voted yes on a ballot measure that proposed borrowing a total $70 million to support affordable housing and conservation in the coming years.

4:35 p.m.: Voting after relocating

Hana Parpan, 18, recently made the move to Madison County from Buncombe County, she told reporter Johnny Casey.

According to Parpan, no one particular race drew her interest. She said she felt women's reproductive rights was the most important issue in the election.

""I just moved from Asheville, and I had (candidates) in Asheville that I was excited about,"" Parpan said. ""I wanted to make sure I voted because reproductive rights are the most important issue to me in this election.""

4:27 p.m.: Trust is key

Lifelong Fairview resident Stephen Foster, 23, told reporter Karrigan Monk at Fairview Volunteer Fire Department that he does not affiliate himself with any party and instead voted for who he can trust on an individual basis.

He said he sees Democrats and Republicans as extremists and he does not want that for the country.

“Unfortunately both sides are still fighting a lot because they’re not caring about us and the American people,” Foster said. “Instead they care about themselves, their jobs and making profits.”

Poll workers said that as of 3:30 p.m., 236 people had voted today.

4:20 p.m.: Sometimes, it take two trips

Leighann Gardner and Cole Rener were among the steady trickle of voters at the West Asheville Recreation Center. They’d realized, on arrival, that they were voting at a different precinct this year and despite the runaround, were heading back out to try again.

What makes voting this year worth two stops?

“I had a lot of voter apathy that’s gone away in the past few years because I feel like it really, even if you don’t feel like it matters, it might,” Gardner told reporter Sarah Honosky.

“We saw something we never thought would happen, and the apathy was shaken right out of us.”

Even if a single vote sometimes feels like a lost cause in national elections, she said it stands to have an impact in her local community.

Rener agreed and said the “tumultuous political climate” of the last several years drove him out to the polls.

“Now more than ever … whether it counts or not, now is the time to show out here and vote,” Rener said.

He was motivated for candidates like Cheri Beasley, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, and by her promises to reform the criminal justice system and legalize medical marijuana, which he said could make a big difference for those with chronic illnesses and pain.

“Your single vote might not change the world, but showing up and being somebody who votes, and getting your friends to vote, that could.”

4:15 p.m.: Weaverville update

From reporter Ryan Oehrli:

It's a slow flow of people coming and going at the Weaverville Community Center, but appearances can be deceiving. A poll worker says that roughly 500 people have voted here so far today.

4:10 p.m.: A vote for change

From reporter Christian Smith:

Joy Moore, 55, said she has voted every year since she was 18.

She voted at the Shiloh Community Center for Democrats because she said the country needs change and people, especially women, need to be able to control what happens with their own body.

4:07 p.m.: 'Something here is important'

A Madison County update from reporter Johnny Casey:

Pat McFee, a former fiscal officer and supervisor with the county, is the North Marshall precinct chair.

According to McFee, the North Marshall precinct has roughly 1,400 registered voters.

McFee said as of 12:15 p.m., the precinct had seen more than 200 voters on Election Day, while roughly 900 ballots were cast early.

McFee, 81, has worked election days in Madison County for more than 30 years.

""I've been here plenty of times where there were a lot less (voters) in midterms,"" McFee said. ""So, something here is important to somebody.""

4 p.m.: Clothing choice a coincidence

Alysha Harris, 39 and Jason Vickery, 36, were exiting the polls at the West Asheville Rec Center. They’d both worn all blue, but they said, laughing, it wasn’t an intentional statement.

Though they were leaving the area in a few months, Harris told reporter Sarah Honosky thet they were driven to vote by her nieces and nephew, who live in the area, and Vickery’s parents, who are moving to North Carolina soon.

“I just felt like, I had to do it. I had to get out here and try to make sure that the republicans don’t take over,” Harris said. It’s the big-ticket items she can’t stand to risk, such as abortion rights, gun control, social security and Medicare.

“Normally I would go into this and look at all the candidates on both sides and see who I agree with more, but it’s become so divided at this point, it’s hard to do that anymore.”

3:52 p.m.: Shutting out the noise

Gregory Leddy told reporter Karrigan Monk at Haw Creek Elementary that the process of voting drew him out to the polls.

“I thought it was very important to vote and not be dissuaded by all the noise out there,” Leddy said. “I thought that it was important first of all to vote not only for the candidates, but for those who I share the same Democratic values.”

3:47 p.m.: Strategic voting

Tori Hartman told reporter Ryan Oehrli at Tempie Avery that she voted for her neighbor, Rebecca Strimer, and Jesse Warren for the school board.

""I voted more strategically, locally,"" she said. ""And I voted more general in the bigger picture because I feel that we need to stop some of the spending,"" she said of national races.

3:40 p.m.: 'Most important' election

Johnny Casey reports from the North Marshall precinct.

Patrick Ward, 33, is chair of the Madison County Republican Party.

As a younger voter and party chair, Ward said he felt it was his responsibility to bridge the gap between older, more conservative Madison residents and younger, more moderate voters.

""I think this is probably the most important election we've had, at least since I've been eligible to vote (in 2008),"" Ward said. ""There are world events going on that are going to be setting a precedent for how we handle things in the future, and try to handle things the right way. I don't know which side is the right way or the wrong way right now, but the Republican side is the side where we'll be able to make a difference.""

3:35 p.m.: A busy day

Reporter Christian Smith was at Shilo Community Center.

Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, Democratic candidate in North Carolina's 11 Congressional District race, was leaving Shiloh Community Center at around 2:50.

She said she was trying to make it to 15 polling locations today to meet with voters.

3:30 p.m.: 'Get the Democrats out'

Chris Dunham, 73, told reporter Ryan Oehrli at Tempie Avery that he came out to ""vote the Republicans into office and get the Democrats out as soon as possible.""

""That's one thing that's brought this country down,"" he said of abortion rights.

Climate change is a ""big scam,"" he added.

Dunham is originally from California, he said.

Sarah Honosky reports from the West Asheville recreation Center.

For Wes Ogden, a 44-year-old bartender in West Asheville, he came out to vote because “things are sliding in a really weird direction.”

“We need to get back to a two-party system that tries to work with itself, and not go back 50 years.”

He spoke of fearing the loss of women’s rights, such as abortion access, and wanting to combat the misinformation that drives panic and fervor at public schools, which have become political battlegrounds in recent years.

With Roe v. Wade overturned, he said the threats against gay marriage are also among issues that drove him to vote.

Ogden said he felt politics had gotten away from extreme polarization for a while, but in recent years the tide has turned, “and now, people we know stand to lose stuff.”

As a bartender in town and someone who has been in the music scene for 20 years, Ogden said Andrew Fletcher, a local musician running for City Council, and Kim Roney, a music educator and former bartender running for mayor, will always get his vote.

3:15 p.m.: 1st-time voter

Campaign workers outside Haw Creek Elementary told reporter Karrigan Monk that while there have been no lines to vote as of yet, the turnout has been “steady.”

Lilly Garcia of Asheville voted for the first time today and said she voted a straight Democrat ticket. “It gives you a voice,” Garcia said of voting.

3:08 p.m.: 'Most important' election

Tom Benfield, who has been volunteering for more than 30 years with the Democratic Party, told News Record & Sentinel reporter Johnny Casey that he feels this election ""may be the most important in his lifetime.""

""It's going to be real close,"" Benfield said. ""I just hope that when the results come out that everybody accepts the results. I hope there are no problems if a certain party loses. I'm with the Democratic Party. If we lose, we lose. So, I accept the results.""

3 p.m.: A vote for Budd

Andrew Jones reports from Woodfin:

Luke Gassaway made his way to the Woodfin Community Center to vote despite a broken leg from a recent car accident. U.S. Senate candidate Cheri Beasley’s opponent, Republican Tedd Budd, was on his mind.

“I think everybody should vote,” Gassaway said. “I don't care if you vote for either side. I just think everybody needs to do their civil duty, you know.”

He said abortion was on his mind as he voted for Budd and said he was against it. Budd, Gassaway said, was a person of values and that’s why he one his vote. Gassaway is a member of the National Rifle Association, another element that attracted him to Budd.

He doubled down on the freedom to vote regardless of party.

“Even if you're not voting for who I think would want you to vote for, I think everybody should show that you care enough to come vote,” he said. “It's a thing about pride, I guess. You know, some countries don't even have the right … and I just feel blessed to be able to do that.”

2:57 p.m.: Crime is an issue

Ryan Oehrli reports from Tempie Avery Montford Center:

Angela Waters said that she cares about crime in Asheville. She voted early for Esther Manheimer for mayor and Quentin Miller for sheriff, she said.

""I think they really care,"" she said of the two.

Waters has lived in Montford for 13 years. Her grandparents lived here, too, she said.

2:52 p.m.: Madison County check-in

News-Record & Sentinel reporter Johnny Casey is talking with voters in Madison County.

Keaton Griffin, 30, said the County Commission race is the one he's paying closest attention to.

“Madison County is going through an interesting phase, along with many other rural counties of WNC near Asheville,” said Griffin, who voted at Madison Early College High. “It’s important this election our county commissioners continue to understand and develop the growing need for balance between tradition and change. However things turn out, it’s most important to remain hopeful, listen closely, and stick together.“

Steve Chandler, 48, of Asheville, voted at Enka-Candler Library today.

2:35 p.m.: 2nd-time voter

At Woodfin Community Center, 406 people had voted by 2 p.m. The chief judge there told reporter Andrew Jones that the turnout has been “non-stop” since polls opened at 6:30 a.m.

There, Quantasia Williams, a 23-year-old esthetician, voted for the second time in her life. She called the process overwhelming but had health care rights on her mind.

“I do want to keep North Carolina pro-choice and pretty progressive and liberal as I can,” she said. “But it's like, I don't know everything … and it's really overwhelming.”

Asked what candidates were on her mind she said noted North Carolina Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate Cheri Beasley.

Though Williams is a Woodfin resident, she said she was thinking of the city of Asheville.

I didn't really know since I'm in a town of Woodfin I couldn't do anything for Asheville City Council and I can’t even vote for Asheville mayor,” she said. “I was really interested in Kim Roney.”

If someone was still on the line about voting, Williams said she’d encourage them to do it, but knows the process can be daunting.

2:25 p.m.: What does an election judge do?

Teresa Beeman, chief judge of the Enka-Candler voting district, told reporter Carole Terrell that 391 people voted from 6:30 a.m.-noon today at the Enka-Candler Library. She is the Jill of trades and says, “I can handle problems that come up that cannot be handled at the check in desk.”

Tim Carey, who's new to Asheville, declined to tell reporter Ryan Oehrli whom he voted for. He is a retired colonel with the Air Force and a self-described moderate. He voted at Stephens-Lee Recreation Center.

""What saddens me today is that, in this country, we've become so polarized,"" Carey said. ""We only listen to the voices that are extreme right or extreme left because they're the loudest.""

A phrase he reiterated while talking to a reporter: ""Country over party.""

1:55 p.m.: Precinct confusion

Black Mountain News reporter Karrigan Monk has been talking with voters at Black Mountain Primary. She said several voters told her they went to BMP because it was the only polling location they knew, only to find out it was the wrong location for them.

https://dailycaller.com/2022/12/21/dem-pacs-silent-ftx-money/,Dem-Aligned PACs Are Radio Silent On Returning Nearly $30 Million In SBF Donations,"Three PACs, who spent millions on Democratic candidates or advocacy, have not publicly stated whether they will return a combined $29.3 million in donations from disgraced former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, and did not return a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.

The groups, Protect Our Future, GMI PAC and Vote Rev PAC, may be obligated to return the money as part of the bankruptcy proceedings for Bankman-Fried’s former company, FTX, according to Bloomberg.

In recent weeks, the Democratic National Committee and several candidates and politicians who received money from Bankman-Fried have announced plans to either return the money or donate a matching value to charity.

A trio of Democrat-affiliated Political Action Committees (PAC) that together received nearly $30 million from disgraced former crypto CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, according to the Washington Post, have not yet announced whether they intend to return this money, and have not responded to inquiries from the Daily Caller News Foundation.

The Protect Our Future PAC, GMI PAC, and Vote Rev PAC received a combined total of just over $29.3 million from Bankman-Fried in the 2022 election cycle, according to the Washington Post. In total, Bankman-Fried donated just shy of $39 million to Democrat-aligned causes in the 2022 midterm election cycle, making him the second-largest individual donor to Democratic groups in the 2022 election cycle, according to finance watchdog OpenSecrets.

Protect Our Future, who received $27 million from Bankman-Fried, spent roughly $19 million on broadcast and media ads and roughly $1 million on media production for Democratic candidates and issues via the company Screen Strategies Media, according to OpenSecrets. Screen Strategies Media received a combined total of $52 million from more than two dozen groups aligned with Democratic candidates, with Protect Our Future donating more than three times the next largest donor, according to OpenSecrets.

GMI PAC received $2 million from Bankman-Fried, and while it made no direct contributions to candidates, it gave roughly $5.8 million to the Democrat-aligned Web3 Forward PAC and $2.8 million to the Republican-aligned Crypto Innovation PAC in the 2022 midterm cycle, according to the Federal Election Committee (FEC). Web3 forward endorsed half a dozen Democratic nominees to the House of Representatives in the 2022 midterms, all of whom were victorious.

The Vote Rev PAC, who received $350,000 from Bankman-Fried, spent more than $95,000 directly in support of two candidates, Sen. Jonathan Ossoff of Georgia and Sen.-elect Raphael Warnock of Georgia, though Warnock received just $288.29 from the group, according to the FEC. The group is primarily focused on tripling voter turnout — a goal it spent roughly $2 million on in the 2022 cycle, according to the FEC — and revolutionizing “the way the progressive movement engages with voters,” according to its website.

These groups may be forced to return these donations to Bankman-Fried’s former company, FTX, as part of the crypto exchange’s bankruptcy process following its collapse amid allegations that the former billionaire defrauded customers for billions, according to Bloomberg. Whether or not this money can feasibly be recovered is unclear at this time, in part due to the various state and federal laws governing campaign finance, in part because much of the money might have already been spent, but also because courts might find it not worth making the attempt.

Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas at the request of the U.S. on Dec. 12, and is set to be extradited to the U.S. possibly as soon as Wednesday afternoon. Bankman-Fried’s mother, Barbara Fried, and brother, Gabe Bankman-Fried, stepped down from their roles in the Dem-aligned dark money group Mind The Gap in November, after FTX’s collapse put the family’s political operations in the spotlight.

Media outlets ProPublica and Vox announced that they would be returning a combined $1.8 million in grants donated by Sam Bankman-Fried Tuesday.

The Democratic National Committee, Democratic Senatorial Campaign committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, plan to return the roughly $1.1 million they received from Bankman-Fried, pending guidance on the ongoing lawsuits surrounding the former CEO, according to Reuters. The Democratic Senate Majority Committee announced plans Dec. 20 to return $2 million from Sam Bankman-Fried and $1 million from FTX’s former head of engineering, Nishad Singh, according to CNBC.

Various politicians who received money directly from Bankman-Fried — including Democratic Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and Dick Durbin of Illinois, Republican Sens. John Boozman of Arkansas and John Hoeven of North Dakota — have publicly announced, or confirmed to the DCNF, that they intend to donate or otherwise return the funds they received, which ranged between $2,500 to roughly $20,000.

https://sfist.com/2022/10/28/reactions-and-condemnations-flow-in-from-national-state-and-local-leaders-following-attack-at-pelosi-home/,"Reactions and Condemnations Flow In From National, State, and Local Leaders Following Attack at Pelosi Home","The toxic and vitriolic energy of our body politic erupted into the city of San Francisco once again Friday morning with an attack by a conspiracy-obsessed loon on the home of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that left her husband seriously injured.

Is accused attacker David DePape a far-right zealot? Far-left? It doesn't really matter, and what we know so far points to a bit a both — or to the ugly overlaps at the far ends of the political spectrum, where the two sides circle back to each other.

DePape lived in Berkeley in the last decade with a noted nudist activist whose politics one would assume were pretty far left. Being an anti-vaxxer has been the purview of both the far-right Trumpists and the far-left natural-medicine enthusiasts of Marin and beyond. And as the Chronicle reported via some now unpublished blog posts, DePape was something of an equal-opportunity bigot with various negative views on feminists, the ""woke"" left, LGBTQ people, and Jews. Maybe we can just go with ""crazy.""

The reactions to the attack have been widespread, and they've come from across the political spectrum.

Republican Senator Susan Collins, who herself has been the target of attacks on recent years, said in a statement that she ""was horrified by this vicious attack on Paul Pelosi at his home.""

""My prayers are with him, Speaker Pelosi and their family,"" Collins said.

Retiring Republican Senator Ben Sasse, per the New York Times, said that ""every single American needs to be lowering the temperature. This is increasingly obvious: Disturbed individuals easily succumb to conspiracy theories and rage — the consequences are bloody and un-American.""

Governor Gavin Newsom said, ""Our leaders should never fear for their safety and the safety of their families in serving the people they were elected to represent. Not in their homes, not at the U.S. Capitol, not anywhere.”

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the attack a ""dastardly act.""

What happened to Paul Pelosi was a dastardly act. I spoke with Speaker Pelosi earlier this morning and conveyed my deepest concern and heartfelt wishes to her husband and their family, and I wish him a speedy recovery. — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) October 28, 2022

The Lincoln Project, a group of anti-Trump Republicans, tweeted about the attack saying, ""The @GOP fueled this fire. It's time for them to put it out. We're awaiting statements from every member of the party condemning the attack on Speaker Pelosi's husband and all political violence.""

State Senator Scott Wiener said in a statement, ""This attack is terrifying, and the direct result of right wing rhetoric and incitement against Speaker Pelosi and so many other progressive leaders.""

Wiener added, ""I've experienced firsthand how right wing political violence and threats that we as elected officials — and our families — face every single day badly damage democracy and must end. Words have consequences, and without question, the GOP's hate and extremism has bred political violence.""

San Francisco Mayor London Breed called the attack a ""horrific and scary incident,"" and she thanked a specific dispatcher with the Department of Emergency Management. ""I want to thank Heather Grives, the 911 emergency dispatcher who took the call and acted quickly to get first responders on scene,"" Breed said in a tweet. ""We are so lucky to have 911 dispatchers who continue to go above and beyond for our City and its residents.""

By JOHN L. MICEK

December 04, 2022

Sunday



(SitNews) - It’s difficult to overstate the importance of this week’s U.S. Senate vote codifying protections for same-sex and interracial marriage as both a triumph of bipartisanship and fundamental decency.

It’s also difficult to overstate, sadly, how much further we have to go to ensure full equality for LGBTQ Americans.

First, the good news.

Last Tuesday, 61 lawmakers – including 12 Republicans – voted to approve the bill, which came in response to fears that a U.S. Supreme Court, perfectly content to topple abortion rights, might next come for marriage equality as well. The bill must still go back to the U.S. House which, for now, remains in Democratic hands.

The moral arc of the universe, as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King famously remarked, is long, but always bends toward justice.

It was just a decade ago, in 2012, that former President Barack Obama historically announced that he’d shifted his position to support same-sex marriage. And seven years have elapsed since a very different high court granted same-sex marriage rights in the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges ruling.

That is a pretty significant bending toward justice. But as the deadly rampage at Colorado’s Club Q last month vividly reminds us, the ongoing journey towards full justice for millions of our fellow citizens remains a long one.

As long as sitting members of Congress can hurl the most vile of slurs against LGBTQ Americans, as long as a former president of United States can sit down to dinner with an antisemite and his white supremacist sidekick and still not face total ostracization by his own party, there will remain work to do.

The bill the Senate passed also is far from perfect, because it requires the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages where they are legal. Thirty-five states, including Pennsylvania, still have same-sex marriage bans on their books. That exposes LGBTQ citizens to harm if the high court ever moves toward tossing Obergefell.

That possibility is all the more jarring given how out of step the court appears to be with the majority of Americans. Support for same-sex marriage rights remains widespread – reaching a historic high of 71 percent in June, according to Gallup.

But that still means that three in 10 Americans remain opposed. Some of that may be on the basis of concerns about religious liberty. There also is no denying that too much of it is based on nothing more than hate – hate that can turn deadly, and be legitimized at the highest levels of power.

The truth is in the data.

As of last month, at least 32 transgender and gender nonconforming people had lost their lives in 2022, according to the Human Rights Campaign.

In 2020, the FBI recorded 1,051 victims of hate who were targeted because of their sexual orientation (13.5 percent of all hate crimes reported that year) and 236 people who were targeted because of their gender identity (3 percent of all hate crimes reported that year), according to GLAAD data.

The instance of suicidal ideation among LGBTQ youth remains alarmingly high, with nearly half saying they seriously considered suicide in the past year, NPR reported last month, citing data compiled by the Trevor Project.

That’s just one reason why we can never speak too loudly about the victories among those tragedies.

So while it is imperfect, let’s talk about and celebrate this historic vote. Government does much that is blundering, blind and borderline incompetent. But in those instances where it moves to protect the health, welfare, and security of millions of our fellow citizens, and to ensure the same equality we all enjoy, those are moments to be lifted up and noted.

It takes on an added importance when families and friends are mourning the loss of their loved ones, not just in Colorado, but across the country. It becomes a duty when a young person is considering taking their own life because they fear they will be shunned instead of embraced and celebrated.

We can never say often enough that we love them, that we hold them close, and that we will vow to keep them safe. Not just in times of tragedy. But every day. And always.

Several influential Stocktonians passed away in 2022, but their local legacies live on.

Some are remembered for their achievements in life — a name cemented on the crosstown freeway, a collection of hundreds of thousands of Valentine’s Day cards, foundations left in their stead or stories of their relentless work ethic, activism or kindness.

Others were taken before their life’s work was finished — or had barely begun. The slayings of a local high school freshman and a fire captain brought the Stockton community together in mourning, remembrance and reflection.

Alycia Reynaga

Stockton lost 15-year-old Stagg High School freshman Alycia Reynaga April 18 when she was killed on campus by a trespasser.

Some 750 Stocktonians came to Cathedral of the Annunciation to celebrate Reynaga’s life and lay her to rest.

Her death shed light on safety measure issues at Stockton Unified School District.

Bill Jennings

A water advocate for over three decades and a defender of Delta fisheries, Bill Jennings, 79, passed away Dec. 27.

Jennings was a co-founder of local nonprofit Restore the Delta and served as executive director at California Sportfishing Protection Alliance. In January Jennings was inducted into the California Outdoors Hall of Fame.

Jennings generated millions of dollars for Delta restoration projects. County Chairman Chuck Winn said he was responsible for defeating multiple iterations of the Delta Tunnel Project.

“His activism and legacy will leave a lasting impact on water policy and projects in our region for many years to come,” Winn said in a statement. “He will truly be missed.”

Bill White

A retired U.S. Marine and recipient of over 300,000 Valentine's Day Cards, Bill White died in March at age 106.

White was thought to be the oldest living Marine before his death. He received the Purple Heart for injuries sustained during the Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945 and later served during the Korean War.

White started Operation Valentine in 2020 with the goal of receiving 10,000 Valentine’s Day cards for his memorabilia collection. He received 14,000 in a single day and ended up with over 300,000.

“I wasn’t expecting anything like this,” he told USA Today. “It hit me like a ton of bricks. I still can’t get over it.”

Dean ‘Dino’ Cortopassi

Agricultural leader, 2005 Stocktonian of the Year and “giant of a man,” Dean “Dino” Cortopassi died in February at age 84 after complications from a stroke.

“He did so much for this community in so many areas — education, agriculture, protecting the water of the Delta area,” former Greater Stockton Chamber of Commerce CEO Doug Wilhoit said in February.

Cortopassi, the son of an immigrant farmer, invested in agribusiness ventures like Stanislaus Food Products, Gilroy Canning, Sierra Quality Canners, Muir Glen Organic Tomatoes and Corto Olive. He was a pioneer in vineyard-style olive farming.

Cortopassi also started numerous local charities, including the Wetlands Preservation Foundation and the JobRedi Foundation to provide assistance to high school graduates.

Ernie Marcopulos

Ernie Marcopulos, former basketball coach, athletic director and namesake of San Joaquin Delta College's Marcopulos Gym died Nov. 2. He was 96.

""He was a go-getter, I mean he was aggressive in the sense that he wanted to be successful and he wanted to win,"" said Rob DeWitt, Marcopulos' successor as head coach of Delta College men's basketball. ""Our relationship was good and Ernie was very loyal and he would have your back on things.""

As Delta College's athletic director from 1974 to 1996, Marcopulos was a strong proponent for Title IX and created equal opportunities for young women interested in intercollegiate athletics. An administrator ahead of his time, he implemented 11 women's sports at the college in 1979.

J. Foster Fluetsch

Former American Savings and Loan President J. Foster Fluetsch died in February at age 85.

Nearly four decades ago, the businessman and philanthropist led the Stockton-based State Savings and Loan through its transformation into the largest savings and loan in the United States.

“We had 6,000 employees at (the savings and loan), and I think everybody there knew Foster and absolutely loved him,” Sheri Reiman-Estes, a former colleague of Fluetsch said. “I can’t imagine the world without him.”

American Savings and Loan was once Stockton's largest private employer in the 1980’s with 1,800 employees.

Max Fortuna

Stockton Fire Capt. Vidal “Max” Fortuna, 47, was fatally shot on Jan. 31 as fire crews worked a dumpster fire near Independence Park.

Fortuna’s death shocked the community, and his memorial service overflowed with love for the fallen firefighter. Those who gathered told stories of a man whose life was devoted to three pillars: faith, family and being a fireman.

“Today we honor a leader, a hero and a man who was deeply loved,” Stockton Mayor Kevin Lincoln said at Fortuna’s Feb. 6 memorial service. “That is how Capt. Max Fortuna will always be remembered.”

Robert Somerville, the man charged in Fortuna’s death, could face a jury trial as early as Jan. 10, 2023.

Michael Calosso

Michael “Mike” John Calosso, 79, died in March after a lifetime of serving San Joaquin Valley farmers through his family’s nearly century-old agricultural business.

His eldest daughter, Brenda Pozzo, said Calosso had a tough exterior, but on the inside he was “a big teddy bear.”

When M. Calosso & Son’s building on Miner Avenue caught fire on the Fourth of July in 2013, the company’s suppliers raced to replace damaged materials within a day — a testament to Calosso’s rock-solid business relationships, Calosso’s son-in-law, Jeff King, said.

Mike Leabo

Stockton aquatics legend and longtime water polo coach Mike Leabo died Jan. 13.

A coach for over 35 years at Stockton staples like St. Mary’s High school, the Boys & Girls Club, Spanos Duck Teams, Big Valley Water Polo and San Joaquin Delta College, Leabo was commemorated April 28 with the renaming of its pool.

“He was just very positive, he was always encouraging his athletes,” Nathan Varosh, one of Leabo’s athletes, said in April. “He had a great knowledge of the game and just a really amazing skill set to connect with kids and teach them the game.”

Wilhelmina Henry

Stockton Unified School District’s first Black teacher Wilhelmina Henry died April 2 at age 102.

Henry spent decades as an educator, counselor, mentor and cherished neighbor. She moved to Stockton from South Carolina in the 1940s, and her dedication, impact and love for the community made her a Stocktonian.

“Love is the answer,” was her popular motto throughout her career and life’s work. She praised her students, applauded their success and established positive family-like relationships with them.

“That is the only thing that works,” Henry said. “Negative comments do nothing but destroy — adults and children.”",Q4

FHP said the driver of a gray Toyota Tacoma was traveling the wrong way on State Route 44 in DeLand, Florida, around 2:20 a.m. on Sunday and crashed head-on with a Black Infinity Q50, and then reportedly ran away.

The names of the three people killed have not been released.

https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2022/1207/Trump-s-firm-found-guilty-of-fraud.-He-faces-deeper-legal-waters,Trump’s firm found guilty of fraud. He faces deeper legal waters.,"Former President Donald Trump has announced that he is running for the White House again in 2024. At the same time, he is facing the greatest legal jeopardy of his life, as the Department of Justice intensifies its investigation into the potential mishandling of secret documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort.

It is impossible to predict how long this investigation will last or whether federal prosecutors will in the end decide to take the momentous step of indicting a once and possibly future U.S. chief executive. But if they do, the next two-year cycle of American politics could be a jolting journey into unexplored territory.

Trump supporters would almost certainly blast any criminal case the DOJ were to bring against the former president as political retribution by a successor from the other party. If prosecutors pass on such action, a countervailing number of anti-Trump voters may see it as a sign that he is indeed above the law, with unknown consequences for U.S. democracy.

Why We Wrote This The DOJ may have to weigh which is a greater harm to America. If it indicts Donald Trump, it risks the loss of faith of his followers. If it lets allegations against the former president go, it risks society’s belief that everyone is subject to the law.

“That’s why it’s important that the people making these decisions have a lot of experience. The answers are going to have grave consequences for our country,” says Rebecca Roiphe, a former Manhattan prosecutor and current professor at New York Law School.

A variety of legal threats

The Mar-a-Lago case is only one of Mr. Trump’s current legal problems. Under newly appointed special counsel Jack Smith, the Justice Department continues to probe whether the former president incited an insurrection, committed election fraud, or engaged in other illegal actions in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.

Mr. Smith, in one of his first major actions since his appointment, on Tuesday sent grand jury subpoenas to local officials in three battleground states the Trump team tried to flip following the election: Arizona, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The subpoenas asked for any and all communication between the officials and Mr. Trump, his aides, and many Trump allies.

Peter Dejong/AP/File Prosecutor Jack Smith waits for the start of a court session in The Hague, Netherlands, Nov. 10, 2020. Appointed last month as special counsel overseeing investigations related to former President Donald Trump, Mr. Smith has a long track record prosecuting public corruption and war crimes.

Meanwhile, in Georgia, Atlanta-area District Attorney Fani Willis is overseeing a special grand jury that is weighing whether Mr. Trump and his allies broke state law in pushing to overturn President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory there.

And this week the Manhattan District Attorney’s office wrapped up its prosecution of the Trump Organization on 17 felony counts of tax fraud with convictions across the board.

Mr. Trump was not personally charged in the case, which accused the firm of dodging taxes by lavishing executives with unreported perks. Potential fines are about $1.6 million, a small slap for the organization. But the Trump name has now been connected to a criminal enterprise.

The former president’s company now stands “convicted of crimes. That is consequential,” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said after the verdict.

Significance of a special counsel

Mr. Trump thus has legal exposure on a number of fronts. But in particular, the appointment of Mr. Smith, the special counsel, may have heightened Mr. Trump’s vulnerability to federal criminal charges, say some legal experts.

Mr. Smith has a reputation among some of his peers for aggressiveness. Andrew Weissmann, former lead prosecutor for special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, tweeted this warning upon announcement of Mr. Smith’s new position: “I was described ... as a pit bull. Jack Smith makes me look like a golden retriever puppy.”

His appointment appears intended to put some substantive and political distance between Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Justice Department’s Trump investigations. In his announcement of the special counsel appointment, Mr. Garland cited Mr. Trump’s announcement that he’s running again for president and Mr. Biden’s “stated intention to be a candidate as well.”

But it is also an unmistakable sign that the government’s Trump probes are serious and charges are a real possibility. Why bother to appoint a special counsel for an investigation that is winding down?

The Mar-a-Lago case centers on whether documents, including classified government records, were illegally mishandled when Mr. Trump left the White House and moved to his Florida resort, and whether Mr. Trump and his aides obstructed government attempts to find and retrieve the papers.

Mr. Smith – former head of the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section, and more recently a war crimes prosecutor in Europe – now has the power to decide whether to prosecute this case, as well as any high-level charges that might arise from the sweeping investigation into the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.

Mar-a-Lago is a much more straightforward investigation, and thus likely poses the most immediate danger to Mr. Trump and his aides, say some legal experts. It would be more like prosecuting a simple bank robbery or a narcotics transaction than a complex white-collar conspiracy, wrote former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti last month.

Andrew Harnik/AP Attorney General Merrick Garland leaves after naming Jack Smith as special counsel to oversee the Justice Department's Trump investigations, at the Justice Department in Washington, Nov. 18, 2022. Following from left are Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division Kenneth Polite, and U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Matthew Graves.

The FBI has already confiscated thousands of government-owned documents, including dozens of secret ones, from Mar-a-Lago under a duly ordered search warrant.

“By keeping Top Secret documents even after he received a grand jury subpoena and a personal visit from the DOJ demanding their return, Trump served up a very easy case to the DOJ,” wrote Mr. Mariotti.

Higher court rulings

Last week, a federal appeals court lifted a procedural hurdle that has slowed Justice Department progress in the Mar-a-Lago case. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled a judge was wrong to interfere with the investigation by appointing a special master to review material seized by the FBI from the former president’s resort.

Department of Justice investigators had been blocked from following up leads provided by the bulk of the documents while the special master had conducted his review.

The 11th Circuit ruling sharply criticized federal District Judge Aileen Cannon for approving the special master in the first place.

“The law is clear,” the appeals court wrote. “We cannot write a rule that allows any subject of a search warrant to block government investigations after the execution of the warrant. Nor can we write a rule that allows only former presidents to do so.”

Mr. Trump may appeal this ruling. But lately the former president has fared badly in the Supreme Court: Late last month high court justices, without noted dissent, cleared the way for House committees to receive several years of Mr. Trump’s tax returns from the IRS.

It is far from clear whether the special counsel will indict Mr. Trump or anyone else in the Mar-a-Lago matter. It is possible that Mr. Smith will work from the bottom up, pressuring lower-level aides in an effort to strengthen his evidence. Some legal experts believe the Justice Department might wait to develop an overarching case combining aspects of Mar-a-Lago and the Jan. 6 insurrection before taking the profound step of indicting a former president.

With the Georgia Senate runoff now concluded, the calendar is clear of possible political obstacles to legal action. But only for a short while. Given the length of time any court case against Mr. Trump would take, the Justice Department may soon be bumping up against the 2024 election cycle.

Traditionally, the DOJ tries to avoid court actions that could affect elections for a 60- to 90-day window prior to the vote. Prosecutors would surely want to be thorough in presenting a case against the former president, and Mr. Trump would have numerous opportunities to appeal any outcome that went against him. Given that, any potential case would need to be charged by spring of 2023 at the latest, according to former federal prosecutor and Columbia Law Professor Jennifer Rogers.

Will past be precedent?

Of course, speculations about Mr. Trump’s legal troubles have proved wrong before.

The former president was not charged in the tax fraud case against his company that just wrapped up in a New York court. Last year, the Supreme Court dismissed several cases that charged Mr. Trump with violating the emoluments clauses of the Constitution and illegally profiting from his presidency.

As president, Mr. Trump was investigated by another special counsel, Mr. Mueller, over allegations his 2016 campaign had colluded with Russia and then blocked government attempts to document the connection. Mr. Mueller concluded that he had insufficient evidence to charge a criminal conspiracy in the matter.

If indicted for stolen government documents, Mr. Trump could mount a number of possible defenses, according to an extensive charging memo developed by Just Security – among them, that he had declassified all documents while president, that following his presidency he had simply followed his lawyers’ advice in retaining them, or that subordinates had acted in the case without his knowledge or approval.

The special counsel could also decide that the cases he could reasonably bring and have a good chance of winning are not weighty enough to justify the uproar they would cause.

Ultimately, Mr. Smith – and Attorney General Garland, who has the power to countermand special counsel decisions – may have a difficult decision to weigh, says Professor Roiphe.

She says they might have to look at a potential indictment and decide “which is a greater harm, the prosecution and the loss of faith and disaffection of a significant portion of the population, or letting something like this go?”

“I don’t envy their decision,” Professor Roiphe says.",Q4

Ron Johnson (R-WI) aired a new ad Monday against “defund police” Democrat challenger Mandela Barnes for appearing on Russian state television to rationalize violence against American law enforcement.

“Mandela Barnes rationalized violence against American police officers” on “Vladimir Putin’s propaganda news outlet” just days after five police officers in 2016 were killed in Dallas, Texas, the ad says.

The ambush against police was the deadliest day for police since 9/11, the ad explained.

The ad then shows Barnes’s interview on Russia Today claiming the “police officers are overexercising their badges.” Speaking in a second segment, Barnes told Russia Today “this probably was a retaliatory attack” on police.

The ad comes after a report surfaced about Barnes previously appearing on Russia Today several times to speak about the “total epidemic” of alleged U.S. police brutality in 2015 and 2016.

Barnes is one of the most radical Democrats in the 2022 cycle. He has pushed for defunding police, allowing felons to retain the right to vote, and believes the inmate population in Wisconsin should be cut in half. According to Wisconsin Right Now, Barnes has allowed at least 884 convicted criminals back onto the streets by releasing them on parole.

Barnes has claimed police do not prevent crimes. “Police don’t prevent crimes from happening,” Barnes falsely stated on Real Talk with Henry Sanders. “We don’t live in a surveillance state nor would you want to.”

Barnes believes in abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), permitting driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants, and giving in-state college tuition to illegal immigrants. He has derided small business owners as “selfish” for wanting to serve customers during the pandemic.

Barnes also favors an entirely government-run healthcare system, eliminating the Senate filibuster, packing the Supreme Court, and passing the Green New Deal, which would destroy the American economy to reshape it into a socialist utopia.

Johnson is currently leading Barnes by 6 points, according to the most recent polling.

Authorities say an intruder attacked the couple in their sleep around 3 a.m. on Aug. 13, 2021.

Travis Juetten, 26, fought back but succumbed to his injuries.

His wife, who is 26 now, survived 19 stab wounds.

The following morning, the Idaho Tribune reported that a third nearby attack under eerily similar circumstances.

Sandra Ladd, 71, was found dead in her home in Washougal, Washington, according to Oregon Crime Stoppers. Her death was ruled a homicide after the medical examiner found multiple stab wounds in her torso, Washougal police said at the time.

In all three cases, no suspect has been identified, and no weapons have been recovered.

However, investigators say the Idaho attack was targeted.

And while Snell previously said investigators had ""not ruled out any idea or concept"" he confirmed Friday that they were confident the three cases were unrelated, based on what evidence they've obtained so far.

""We have excellent investigators on these cases and as we get critiqued by other people that don't have any knowledge of it -- it's always very interesting to be critiqued by people who don't have knowledge of a specific case,"" he said, although he added that investigators would consider new evidence if it surfaced.

""Based on what they know from the other two cases, it doesn't seem that they are the same,"" he said.

As they continue to look for answers in the college killings, they are also asking the public for information on Goncalves’ potential stalker — no matter how small the details may be.

""We feel that if there was a stalker, that would be a pretty important piece of information that we would want to know,"" Snell said. ""And so we have followed all the tips and leads for that regard, that we've been able to we have not been able to corroborate anything.

(AP) — A teenager pleaded guilty Monday to terrorism and first-degree murder in a Michigan school shooting that killed four students and put an extraordinary focus on the boy’s home life and the alleged role of his parents in the tragedy.

Ethan Crumbley, 16, pleaded guilty to all 24 charges, nearly a year after the attack at Oxford High School in southeastern Michigan. In the gallery, some relatives of the victims wept as assistant prosecutor Marc Keast described the crimes.

“Yes,” Crumbley replied, looking down and nodding in affirmation, when asked if he “knowingly, willfully and deliberately” chose to shoot other students.

WATCH: 3 dead, 8 injured in Michigan school shooting

The prosecutor’s office said no deals were made ahead of Monday’s plea. A first-degree murder conviction typically brings an automatic life prison sentence in Michigan, but teenagers are entitled to a hearing where their lawyer can argue for a shorter term and an opportunity for parole.

The teenager withdrew his intent to pursue an insanity defense and repeatedly acknowledged under questioning by Oakland County Circuit Court Judge Kwame Rowe that he understands the potential penalties.

His parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, also are jailed on separate charges. Prosecutors accuse the couple of making the gun accessible to Ethan and ignoring his need for mental health treatment. Crumbley’s lawyer, Paulette Michel Loftin, said it’s possible he could be called upon to testify against them.

Ethan Crumbley, who was 15 at the time of the shootings, had no discipline issues at the school, roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Detroit, but his behavior earlier that day raised flags.

A teacher had discovered a drawing with a gun pointing at the words: “The thoughts won’t stop. Help me.” There was an image of a bullet with the message: “Blood everywhere.”

James and Jennifer Crumbley declined to take their son home on Nov. 30 but were told to get him into counseling within 48 hours, according to investigators.

Ethan Crumbley had brought a 9mm Sig Sauer handgun and 50 rounds of ammunition to school in his backpack that day. He went into a bathroom, pulled out the weapon and then began shooting. Within minutes, deputies rushed in and he surrendered without resistance.

A day earlier, a teacher had seen Ethan Crumbley searching for ammunition on his phone. The school contacted Jennifer Crumbley, who told her son in a text message: “Lol. I’m not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught,” the prosecutor’s office said.

The elder Crumbleys are facing involuntary manslaughter charges. Parents have rarely been charged in school shootings, though the guns used commonly come from the home of a parent or close relative.

Prosecutors earlier this year disclosed that Ethan Crumbley had hallucinations about demons and was fascinated by guns and Nazi propaganda.

“Put simply, they created an environment in which their son’s violent tendencies flourished. They were aware their son was troubled, and then they bought him a gun,” prosecutors said in a court filing.

His parents said they were unaware of their son’s plan to commit a school shooting. They also dispute that the gun was easy to grab at home.

Madisyn Baldwin, Tate Myre, Hana St. Juliana and Justin Shilling were killed, while six students and a teacher were wounded. In addition to the counts of first-degree murder and terrorism causing death, Ethan Crumbley admitted guilt to seven counts of assault with intent to murder and 12 counts of possessing a firearm in the commission of a felony.

The judge set Feb. 9 for the start of hearings to determine if he’ll be sentenced to life without parole or get a shorter sentence due to his age, and a chance at release. His lawyers will be able to argue a variety of mitigating circumstances, including family life and mental health. Prosecutors didn’t signal in court if they will argue for a no-parole sentence.

Loftin said the teenager is remorseful: “He’s taking accountability for his actions,” she said. As for the victims, she said there was nothing she could say to give them comfort.

“Obviously it is an extremely emotional day. I don’t think there are any words that could make them feel any better,” she said.

Detroit attorney Ven Johnson, who represents families of several of the victims in a civil suit against the Oxford school district and the Crumbley family, said Monday’s plea “is one small step forward on a long path towards obtaining full justice for our clients.”

“We will continue to fight until the truth is revealed about what went wrong leading up to this tragedy, and who, including Crumbley’s parents and multiple Oxford Community Schools employees, could have and should have prevented it,” Johnson said.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11514251/Kirk-Cameron-banned-hosting-readings-Christian-childrens-book-50-public-libraries.html,Kirk Cameron banned from hosting readings of Christian children's book at 50 public libraries,"Most of the libraries that have rejected Cameron and the book frequently host Drag Queen Story Hours and other LGBTQ-centric events

'This is proof that more than ever, we are getting destroyed in the battle for the hearts and minds of our children,' said Cameron

Growing Pains star Kirk Cameron has a new Christian Children's book out but he's being banned from hosting story hours at publicly funded community libraries that also host similar events for drag queens.

It is common for community libraries to run story-hour programs for kids and parents that correspond with the release of a new book

In recent years, libraries have come under fire for promoting drag queens and other LGBTQ+ centric story hours for young children. It now appears to be the case that those same libraries, which are largely funded by taxpayers, have decided there is no space in their programming lineups for more traditional and faith-based titles.

Cameron's book, As You Grow, 'teaches biblical wisdom and the value of producing the fruit of the spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, self-control,' according to the author.

Actor Kirk Cameron with his Christian children's book As You Grow published by Texas-based Brave Books

Cameron and his publisher have been turned down or ignored by upwards of 50 US public libraries to which they have offered a story hour to promote the new title

Most of these libraries, including the Rhode Island Rochambeau library (pictured), feature LGBTQ+ friendly story hours, but have declined Cameron's book themed around Christianity

Cameron is himself a married father of six children, four of whom are adopted. He has recently spoken out about parts of the left-wing establishment attempting to indoctrinate children as early as possible with progressive ideology.

Several months back, he spoke out against the US public school systems, which he said had been taken over by radical progressives who wish to impart lessons about Critical Race Theory and gender ideology to young children.

'It's sad to say they're doing more for grooming, for sexual chaos and the progressive left than any real educating about the things that most of us want to teach our kids,' he said during a promotion for his film, The Homeschool Awakening.

Now, he is working with conservative children's book publisher Brave Books, which produces 'pro-God, pro-America and anti-woke values.'

Brave Books told Fox News that it had been denied a story hour slot at several libraries explicitly due to the ideology of Cameron's book.

In Providence, Rhode Island, the Rochambeau Public Library told the publisher over the phone, 'No, we will pass on having you run a program in our space.'

'We are a very queer-friendly library. Our messaging does not align,' the library employee added.

When asked about filling out paper work to apply for a story hour, the employee said, 'You can fill out the form to reserve space, to run the program in our space — but we won’t run your program.'

The Rochambeau Public Library regularly hosts a program it calls 'Queer Umbrella,' which is a 'club and safe space where teens can learn, discuss and connect over queer history, art, community resources, and more,' according to its website. It is available to all members of the LGBTQ+ community who are aged 12 and up.

The San Diego public library told Brave that the As You Grow story hour likely isn't 'something we would do.'

'Because of how diverse our community is, I don’t know how many people you would get,' said the library representative.

The library, however, does host a teen queer book club and a range of other 'LGBTQIA events.'

The San Lorenzo public library in Alameda County, California is yet another venue that told Brave they were 'not interested' in his book.

That library recently hosted a legal clinic for individuals interested in 'completing name and gender marker change court paperwork and updating identity documents such as CA birth certificates, driver’s licenses/IDs, passports and Social Security cards.'

The event was part of its 'Every Month Is Pride Month Series.'

The San Lorenzo Public Library made headlines over the summer when its Drag Queen Story Hour was disrupted by five men who were described as members of the far-right Proud Boy organization.

Cameron's new book, As You Grow, has been rejected for story hours at a number of public libraries across the country, many of which feature LGBTQ-centric events like drag queen story hours and legal workshops about changing one's legal name and gender

Drag Queen Story Hour at the San Lorenzo public library in California, where Brave was told there was no interest in having him host a story hour, but where a legal clinic for individuals interested in 'completing name and gender marker change court paperwork' was recently held

Trent Talbot, the CEO of Brave Books, said 'It is devastating to discover that many of our publicly funded libraries have now become indoctrination centers that refuse to allow biblical wisdom to be taught to our children'

The Indianapolis Public Library said Cameron's book did not comport with its 'strategic plan' to promote 'diverse' authors.

'Generally when we have author visits, those are coordinated through our departments. We really have a push. We have a strategic plan in place, so we are really looking at authors who are diverse. Authors of color. That’s really been our focus,' is what an employee told Brave Books.

When the Texas-based publishing house pointed out that Cameron's book contributes to a diversity of ideas, they were told the library is 'focusing on racial equity.'

In response to his inability to be booked at more than 50 libraries that Brave reached out to, Kirk said, 'This is proof that more than ever, we are getting destroyed in the battle for the hearts and minds of our children.'

'Publicly funded libraries are green-lighting ‘gender marker and name change clinics’ while denying a story time that would involve the reading of a book that teaches biblical wisdom. How much more clear can it get?

'We have to start fighting back, or we will lose our kids and this country,' he said.

Brent Talbot, Brave's CEO, said it is 'devastating to discover that many of our publicly funded libraries have now become indoctrination centers that refuse to allow biblical wisdom to be taught to our children.'

'The woke left understands that morality is instilled by the age of 10, and they want their morality to win, not the morality that the Bible teaches,' he added.

Though Cameron and Brave say they will continue pushing the title among America's roughly 9,000 public libraries, the start of their effort has been a series of disappointments.

Public libraries are primarily funded by local governments. A very small portion of library funds come from the federal government, grants and donations.

In general, public funding is dolled out by the local government and is generated by tax dollars, library fines, parking tickets and other ways the city or municipality generates revenue.",Q4

https://www.ammoland.com/2022/11/how-to-stop-school-shootings/,How to Stop School Shootings,"U.S.A. –-(AmmoLand.com)- My heart sinks every time I see breaking news announce another school shooting. It’s like a gut punch – the lost lives, the suffering of the wounded, the horrors the First Responders must encounter, and the families that will never again be whole.

The blame and blood-dancing usually start before the bodies are even recovered. The talking heads call to ban or further regulate firearms, magazines or accessories in common usage as if the contents of my gun safe located thousands of miles from the crime scene somehow played a role in the killings.

Politicians will gleefully announce new infringements, none of which could have prevented the mass murder, but that is never their intent. They were eagerly awaiting another opportunity to do something that will score points with their base and their donors, as well as disarm law-abiding Americans.

Keep in mind that more than three times as many people die each year from excessive alcohol use than from firearms, yet no one is calling to ban bourbon or vodka, because the booze-ban industry died on Dec. 5, 1933, while the gun-ban industry sputters on. Their misguided efforts have no chance of ever stopping mass murders because they are solely fixated on banning an inanimate object, while ignoring the person pulling the trigger and those who help facilitate the crime.

In my humble opinion, if we truly want to stop school shootings we should harden the staff, not just the buildings, and we should focus on the other bad actors, too, not just the trigger-pullers. It’s time to start holding parents, law enforcement and the legacy media strictly accountable – criminally, morally and very publicly – for aiding and abetting these preventable deaths.

Parents

I guarantee more parents will take an interest in the websites their children frequent or the videos they’re downloading the first time they see other parents charged with accessory to murder. They will ensure their firearms are safely stored when they see other parents arrested for aiding and abetting. They will take a sudden interest in the video games their children are playing or pay attention to significant changes in their behavior once police start making arrests for what is the ultimate in criminal neglect –allowing a child to commit mass murder.

Nowadays, children are bombarded by stimuli completely undreamed of by previous generations. Some are good, but many are very bad, if not pure evil. As a result, parenting requires more vigilance than ever before. This is a fact, but it’s not an excuse. Today, if a parent ignores obvious signs their child needs help, allows unauthorized access to weapons and lives are lost, they should pay for their mistakes in prison.

Law Enforcement

How many mass murderers have been known to the FBI or local law enforcement? Most of them. These killers usually have a long history of indicator crimes, which often go completely ignored.

Law enforcement needs to improve how they track potential mass murderers.

Years ago, a few forward-thinking police departments formed career criminal squads. It was their job to follow and hound to death the truly bad hombres who were responsible for a majority of the crime. These units were effective. The civil libertarians hated them, but the bad guys soon tired of the frequent contacts with law enforcement and straightened up or moved on. It’s time to resurrect this model.

Officers today need to understand if they encounter a potential mass shooter or even suspect someone might fit the profile, their responsibility for the safety of the public doesn’t stop when their shift ends.

That’s exactly what happened with the Parkland murderer, whose name does not merit mention.

Law enforcement had 39 contacts with this soulless demon in just seven years. Each officer took a report and moved on. No one took any responsibility, including the FBI.

After this mass murderer posted on social media his goal was to become a “professional school shooter,” an FBI agent asked him a couple questions – over the phone – and that was it. The FBI’s investigation ended. So much for Fidelity, Bravery and Integrity, the much-ballyhooed essence of the FBI.

In a perfect world, agents would have interviewed this hellion in his home, searched his room and seized his computer, phone, journals and, of course, any weapons he had access to. The feds should have made him their top priority. He threatened to shoot up a school! Instead, he was hardly a blip on their radar. This pattern of ineptitude has happened over and over again at every level – federal, state and local.

Everyone with a badge in their billfold who encounters a potential mass shooter should be fired if lives are ever lost because they failed to act. That is how serious law enforcement should take these individuals. This reprioritization should be inculcated throughout the entire department. If an officer can’t handle the added responsibility, they should quit. The stakes are too high to allow anyone to fail.

The same standard should apply if law enforcement fails to act during a mass shooting. Parkland and Uvalde taught us the high price that’s paid when cowards don a badge and gun. Police are issued tactical gear for a reason, and it’s not to loiter around a school hallway playing games on their phones while children are being murdered a few doors down. Unfortunately, there’s no way to identify or screen for cowardice until it’s too late.

Strict accountability is the only way to ensure law enforcement takes every encounter with a potential mass shooter seriously. A lack of time, resources or manpower can no longer serve as an excuse. After all, how could any other law enforcement mission be more important than tracking suspects who could potentially murder kids?

Legacy Media

How many times have you heard cable TV news actors speculating about a possible motive after a mass killing?

These murderers are crazy. That’s the answer. They don’t have a real motive. Their actions are incomprehensible. There’s no way for a rational mind to truly understand the actions of an irrational one. Unfortunately, this doesn’t stop the legacy media from mindlessly speculating, since mindless speculating is what they do.

The media often defaults to bullying as the cause of the carnage – as if every kid who’s ever bullied picks up a gun. Unfortunately, once it’s repeated too many times, some children start identifying with these mass murderers, especially if they’ve been bullied or have other problems fitting in.

Combine this with 24/7 coverage – including the murderer’s favorite websites, games, and even music – and the media has successfully given the killers a near cult-like following, which is exactly what they wanted, and the deadly cycle is bound to repeat itself.

If the legacy media had never named the Columbine killers, much less described how they dressed, what they wrote in their journals, and who they listened to while plotting their murderous assault, they could never have inspired other troubled teens to commit similar barbaric acts. Countless lives would have been spared and hundreds of families would not be grieving today. There’s no debating that.

This is not a call for censorship. The last thing we need is more government intrusion into our lives. Instead, it’s time for some self-restraint by the legacy media.

It’s very easy to hold the legacy media accountable for overblown coverage of a terrible tragedy. Simply change the channel. If enough of us do, they’ll get the message, eventually. It will take time. They’re somewhat of a thickheaded bunch.

Armed Staff

Nowadays, school administrators have focused on hardening their facilities, not their staff. Regardless of how secure a school campus is, Uvalde taught us that a determined maniac can always get in. Legislation that would allow teachers, staff and other volunteers to arm themselves – regardless of their state of residence – would save lives.

Another option that is operating with great success in Florida is the School Guardian Program. School Guardians are not police. They’re not School Resource Officers. They don’t teach classes. They’re not responsible for discipline or counseling. They don’t have office hours or other distractions. Their only responsibility is to shoot bad guys who want to harm kids.

Many of Florida’s School Guardians are combat veterans. They’ve proven they can use deadly force when it’s required. They’re issued a plate carrier, a handgun, and a carbine, and are trained (certified) by local sheriffs. They take their jobs extremely seriously, and they’re easy to spot. They patrol outside the school in the morning as kids are dropped off, and in the afternoon when they’re picked up. So far, no school with a Guardian has been attacked.

Gun-free zones have always been magnets for mayhem. It’s time to end this, put politics aside, and protect our kids.

The black bear population in Connecticut was almost destroyed or removed by the mid-1800s, according to the environmental protection department.

But they made a rebound. The state had a resident population of the bears by the 1980s, and their numbers continue to grow, the department says on its website. There are an estimated 1,000 to 1,200 bears in the state, according to the department.",Q4

The protest march, which is a move to demand early general election, kicked off in the city of Lahore on Friday.Umar said that the PTI march would reach the city of Rawalpindi by November 10 as per new schedule, while convoys of protesters from all over Pakistan will arrive in Islamabad on November 11.The march was interrupted on Sunday after Pakistani journalist Sadaf Naeem was crushed to death by a vehicle carrying Khan. After the incident, the party leadership stopped the procession, and the ex-prime minister expressed condolences over the woman's death.Last week, the Pakistani government asked the country's Supreme Court to halt the PTI's march, but the request was rejected. Before going to court, government representatives said that the authorities would strengthen their policy toward those who attended the protest. In turn, the Islamabad authorities announced that they would not allow the PTI to hold meetings in the city and stepped up the protection of the so-called red zone, in which the main government buildings are located.The previous protest march took place on May 25, when thousands of Khan's supporters reached Islamabad. During the march, clashes broke out between the protesters and the police, in which dozens of people were injured. Following the clashes, Tehreek-e-Insaf decided to stop the protest to avoid bloodshed.Khan was ousted in mid-April amid a spiraling economic crisis after the parliament held a vote of no-confidence in his government. Tehreek-e-Insaf lawmakers boycotted the vote.Since then, numerous protests have been held in Pakistan calling for a snap election amid public discontent with the economic situation in the country under the government headed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who replaced Khan. Khan himself has insisted that his ousting was orchestrated by foreign powers, namely the US.The Election Commission of Pakistan said that new election will not be held until May.

https://www.northcountrypublicradio.org/news/npr/1134060342/we-asked-you-answered-what-precious-object-is-part-of-your-family-history,"We asked, you answered: What precious object is part of your family history?","We interviewed 8 refugees from different corners of the globe and asked: What's one precious belonging you brought along on your journey to remind you of home? The answers ranged from a set of incense stones made by a Yemeni grandmother (and now emitting their special aroma in Ecuador) to Ukrainian sheet music.

We also asked our audience: Tell us about an object from your personal or family history that has special meaning as a memento of the past in a different country or a reflection of your identity.

Thanks to all who shared their stories. Here's a sampling of responses, edited for length and clarity.

A crystal decanter with a chip reminds me of a bold 1911 journey

My precious object is this more-than-a-century-old decanter.

In 1911, when my then 14-year-old grandfather Jan Roušar (changed to John Roushar on Ellis Island) and his family left Oldriš in Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) to come to the United States, they brought along this family heirloom. It is heavy cut crystal and must have had important meaning to carry that far.

I never saw this decanter in my childhood — it had a chip in the lip and was considered unusable. When my mom and Aunt Dorothy helped empty my grandparents' house in the 1970s, it moved to my mom's house and got tucked in the back of a china cabinet.

I came across it a few years ago while helping my parents in the cleanup after a fire. My mom asked me if I wanted it, ""even though it's broken."" I found it beautiful and decided that if and when my husband and I set sail, it would come with us on the seas, just as it had when my dear late grandfather was a boy making his Atlantic crossing.

It has traveled since 2016 with my husband and me on a 40-foot catamaran called ""Grateful,"" which has journeyed to the waters of five continents.

I think Grandpa would approve. He's one of my angels above. I think of the bravery it took for his parents to see the writing on the wall and decide to leave behind their thriving mill business because they could see WWI coming and had no desire for their sons to be pressed into the Kaiser's army.

By comparison, crossing seas is pleasure for my husband Jamie and me. Whenever I look at the decanter I am reminded that willingness to take on bold challenges runs in the family.

A Norwegian grandmother's cabbage dish was a way to say 'I love you'

In 1906 my grandmother, Oline Steffensen, traveled from Norway to the United States. She was 25 years old. She had joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wanted to go to Utah so she could go to the temple there and ""be sealed,"" as the Mormons say, to her mother, who had died when she was a very little girl. The desire to connect to her family members for eternity gave her the courage to make the journey.

In Salt Lake City she married Rudolph Stockseth, a fellow Norwegian, who was a printer. They had nine children. My father was the oldest. They never had enough money, but they had a great deal of love in their family. I remember well the camaraderie of my aunts and uncles at family gatherings.

What Oline brought from Norway was her ability to love ... and to knit ... and to cook.

I remember eating Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners in her small brick home and savoring the aroma and tangy taste of red cabbage cooked with caraway seeds and a dash of vinegar, called ""surkål ."" It was the jewel of the meal to me.

My grandmother's brusque, accented English made me think she was grumpy. I now realize that the food she made – and the red caps she knit for us – were her way of saying, ""I love you.""

I still have the shoes I wore when my family fled the Nazis

I am 84 years old, considered to be a survivor of the Holocaust. But I think of myself as a ""refugee"" lucky to have escaped the Holocaust.

I was not quite 2 years old when my family (mom, dad and older sister) boarded what I was later told was to be the last train out of Paris before the French government was to surrender. I'm told it was the first week of June 1938, but don't know the exact date.

We were heading toward Bordeaux and then on to Spain, armed with all the requisite travel permits, American visas and a small suitcase packed with some clothing as well as my mother's travel sewing kit, contained in a repurposed red metal tobacco tin.

It was a harrowing journey. The train, packed with refugees, was bombed – making war on civilians was a common Nazi tactic. We were lucky enough to survive and proceeded to walk to Bordeaux — which had been declared a closed city because of its strategic location, as well as the French government sequestered in Bordeaux had not yet decided how best to surrender.

We must have walked for miles. I wore my patent leather shoes, my parents carried that small suitcase. Eventually we met by chance the American consulate officer in a small city outside Bordeaux. My father and the officer were able to rent a truck to drive us to the Mediterranean coast. Eventually we were able to cross into Spain and Portugal, where we boarded a Greek freighter that set sail for New York. We arrived on August 11, 1940.

My patent leather shoes, no longer shiny and sparkling, remained on my feet until I outgrew them. I still have them, along with my mother's makeshift sewing kit. I use these items them as props for my volunteer work at the Nassau County Holocaust Memorial and Tolerance Center, where I tell visitors the reasons my family were forced to seek refuge as well as discussing the need for safe havens 82 years later.

I treasure my shoes and mother's sewing kit because it underlines the resiliency, determination and courage that refugees demonstrate in their quest for security — and as a reminder as well that for so many, the sheer presence of luck can chart your future.

Why I will never leave my flute behind

My most precious object is my flute!

I started playing in the school band when I was in the 7th grade, a little over 50 years ago, and once I began playing, there was never any question about what I would do for a career. Playing music meets my spiritual needs like nothing else – and is mentally challenging, which I love.

I majored in music in college. My first job was as a music teacher. When the apartment building where I was living caught fire in the middle of the night, I ran outside. A fireman asked me to move my car so the fire truck could get closer to the building. He went back into my apartment with me so I could get my car keys: ""Just your car keys, ma'am. Nothing else!""

When we left, I had my keys ... and my flute. I would have fought him if he had told me to leave it behind!

If I ever have to ""bug out"" for any reason, you can believe my flute will be the first thing I grab to take along!

Following six decades of sanctions against Cuba, the Biden admin renewed the trade embargo on the neighboring island in September. At the end of the year, this trickled down to the largest NFT marketplace, OpenSea, banning over 30 Cuban creators.

Does Trade Embargo Ban NFT Art?

On September 2nd, the White House released a memorandum on the “Continuation of the Exercise of Certain Authorities Under the Trading With the Enemy Act”. This made Biden the 12th President to have extended the trade embargo on Cuba, now set for September 14, 2023, for a new extension.

The memorandum referenced the enforcement of Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 515. Under exempt transactions, informational material or artistic alteration that is not US-based, is prohibited. This includes “payment of royalties to a designated national with respect to income received for enhancements or alterations made by persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States”.

Consequently, OpenSea started banning Cuban artists soon after. The largest NFT marketplace, handling 66% of all trading volume as of October, clearly states in terms of service that users will have their accounts terminated if they are “subject to any sanctions administered by an agency of the U.S. Government”.

Banned Cuban Creators

The first major NFT collective to be hit was NFTcuba.ART, which has over 70 listed artists. OpenSea disabled their account, but they still have access to their wallet. According to the collective’s interpretation of the US embargo on Cuba, art trade should not be susceptible to banning.

Another NFT collective, Bit Remasa, also had their NFT collections delisted by OpenSea. Interestingly, the founder of Bit Remasa, Erich Garcia Cruz, also screenshotted PancakeSwap.Finance refusing service due to “unavailable for legal reasons”.

Cruz described this deplatforming as “Decentralized Finance. Oil on canvas”, suggesting that DeFi is a veneer without substance. PancakeSwap describes itself as “the most popular decentralized platform in the galaxy”, currently holding $3.11 billion in total-value-locked (TVL).

Delisted artists include even the most popular Cuban names, such as Gabriel Guerra Bianchini. He is known for the first NFT auction originating from Cuba in March 2021, with Hotel Habana 3/10 NFT that is now nowhere to be found on OpenSea.

Is Decentralized Finance a Misnomer?

When the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash privacy protocol in August, several critical implications were revealed:

Even if a smart contract operates on a public blockchain, the pathway from the blockchain to the end user can be blocked. Specifically, this was done through Infura blocking its RPC service between the smart contract and users’ MetaMask wallet.



As centralized assets in a bank’s custody, stablecoin funds could also be frozen, despite being the cornerstone of DeFi protocols for lending and borrowing.



Regardless if companies are deemed centralized (OpenSea) or decentralized (PancakeSwap), their management will enforce US regulation, even preemptively.

For instance, PancakeSwap is backed by Binance, which is itself known for adhering to global regulatory compliance. The situation with OpenSea delisting Cuban artists is even clearer, as Devin Finzer and Alex Atallah founded the company in New York City, the first state to have banned crypto mining powered by fossil fuels in November.

In other words, the meaning of DeFi is likely to be narrowed to platforms having smart contracts instead of human intermediaries. Otherwise, for DeFi to function as originally envisioned without geo-locking, it would have to have the entire stack decentralized: back and front web, wallet, stablecoins, and non-corporate structure.

https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/2022/10/18/court-issues-injunction-against-new-mexico-civil-guard-raul-torrez-bryce-provance-militia-groups/69572208007/,Court issues injunction against New Mexico Civil Guard,"LAS CRUCES − A New Mexico court has granted an injunction against an armed paramilitary group that drew attention to itself in 2020 for its armed presence at demonstrations against police violence and colonialist monuments around the state, claiming they were acting as a volunteer peacekeeping force.

In an order issued Oct. 17, 2nd District Judge Elaine Lujan barred the New Mexico Civil Guard from organizing or operating in public as a military unit outside the authority of New Mexico or ""assuming law-enforcement functions by using or projecting the ability to use organized force at protests, demonstrations, or public gatherings."" The judge also ordered the NMCG to pay court costs, including attorney's fees.

The court issued a default judgment against the group following a bizarre 10-minute deposition taken in March from NMCG founder Bryce Provance, who testified that he had destroyed records pertaining to the organization that had been sought by Bernalillo County District Attorney Raúl Torrez. Provance also claimed to have burned a computer with relevant documents after pouring bleach on it.

In light of the ruling, Torrez filed a motion requesting dismissal of claims against eight individual defendants. He has also entered into consent decrees with Provance and fellow defendant Walter Rodriguez, moving to dismiss claims against them as well.

Torrez, the Democratic candidate for attorney general in the Nov. 8 elections, filed a civil complaint against the New Mexico Civil Guard in the summer of 2020.

That summer, vigils, protests and demonstrations took place statewide denouncing the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police as well as the Las Cruces death of Antonio Valenzuela after a police officer put him in a chokehold.

The New Mexico Civil Guard was one of a few far-right groups that appeared, often in uniform or camouflage gear, bearing arms at demonstrations in Las Cruces and Albuquerque. The group held training events around the state, claiming active members in several New Mexico counties. The group also speculated about running a slate of county sheriff candidates.

The NMCG was present in June 2020 when demonstrators attempted to pull down ""La Jornada,"" a famous statue at the Albuquerque Museum depicting Don Juan de Oñate leading a group of settlers. A counterprotester named Steven Ray Baca, who was not affiliated with the NMCG, shot and wounded a man after being recorded on video assaulting protesters and being chased away. His trial on charges including aggravated battery, battery against other protesters and unlawful carrying of a weapon, remains pending.

Torrez argued that the NMCG's presence emboldened the shooter and threatened the peace and sought an injunction against the group.

In the end, Lujan ruled the injunction was warranted because Provance's deposition demonstrated ""a flagrant, willful, bad faith, callous disregard of the Court's Order,"" and because he admitted to ""willfully destroying records at a time when he had reason to know of pending or future litigation.""

Provance claimed that he was unaware of the lawsuit when he destroyed the evidence in the fall of 2020. Torrez pointed to news interviews and comments in which Provance reacted to the lawsuit prior to that time to demonstrate that could not be true. Provance also sent text messages to a Las Cruces Sun-News reporter in July of that year responding to questions about the lawsuit.

Finally, the judge ruled the NMCG had not complied with a court order to retain new counsel after its defense attorney, Paul Kennedy, withdrew in May. Court rules did not permit the NMCG to represent itself and thus Lujan found the organization in default.

In a statement, Torrez called the ruling ""a victory for the rule of law and a signal to anyone in this state who believes that they can establish their own private paramilitary or police unit to advance their own political agenda.""

“In this tense political environment we must always remember that this is a nation of laws and — regardless of our political views — there is no room for political violence or extremism,"" he continued. ""If we are going to remain a free and democratic society we must resist the impulse towards armed extremism that has been the ruin of so many countries around the world.”

Torrez was co-represented in the suit by the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C., a group that has previously used civil process to win injunctions against white supremacist and paramilitary groups involved in the deadly 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va.

'They never sued us.' Who is the New Mexico Civil Guard?

Provance initially told the Sun-News he planned to appeal, citing the court's requirement that the New Mexico Civil Guard retain counsel. In an email, Provance wrote that the NMCG named in the lawsuit ""is a long since defunct group of individuals who were on (Facebook) and can't stand each other anymore.""

In a subsequent phone call, Provance said he was undecided about the appeal since he may soon be dismissed from the litigation anyway.

Albuquerque attorney Elizabeth Honce represents the 501(c)(3) corporation named New Mexico Civil Guard, Inc., founded in September 2020 — after the lawsuit was filed. That organization, she said, was not affected by the court ruling.

""The corporation did not exist at the time the lawsuit was filed and was never sued,"" she wrote. ""The corporation intervened (in the case) because the plaintiffs were trying to get a judgment against the corporation when they never sued us.""

According to state records, officers of the nonprofit include NMCG members who appeared in camouflage, but without rifles, at a rally outside Las Cruces in March. The group stressed that they were there as participants and not in a peacekeeping role.

Two of the nonprofit's listed directors, John Burks and David Rice, had been named as individual defendants and were included in Torrez's motion to dismiss claims against several individuals.

One of the individual defendants, Wess Rodgers, has filed a federal complaint alleging Torrez engaged in malicious civil prosecution and abuse of process. Rodgers claims he was never a member of the NMCG but had participated in peaceful protests with them. He is also among the defendants Torrez is seeking to dismiss from the lawsuit.

Rodgers' attorney, A. Blair Dunn, accused Torrez of using the courts to serve his political ambitions.

""A default injunction because a made up nonlegal entity cannot hire a lawyer to fight you means absolutely nothing,"" Dunn wrote. ""This is nothing more than a political stunt wasting taxpayer resources that would be better spent fighting real crime.""

Defendant Craig Fitzgerald said he had not been involved with the New Mexico Civil Guard ""for almost two years.""

Rodriguez, who has entered into a consent decree and may soon be dismissed from the litigation, wrote to the Sun-News, ""I honestly don't know what happened.""

Elaborating, Rodriguez expressed confusion over his involvement, saying he had considered membership in the NMCG at one time but had decided against it based on news coverage of the group.

""I got tossed in this lawsuit with everyone,"" he wrote. ""I hope that everybody clears outta everything.""

https://news.stanford.edu/report/2022/10/12/email-text-task-force-report/,The history of Jewish admissions and experience at Stanford,"Dear members of our Stanford community,

I am writing to you today on an important matter – a matter that concerns Stanford University’s history, and one that we must face up to today.

Earlier this year, we created a task force to research allegations that in the 1950s Stanford limited the admission of Jewish students to the university. We also asked the task force to make recommendations on enhancing Jewish life on campus today.

The task force conducted an archivally based historical investigation and has completed its report, which I encourage you to read here. The report finds that actions to suppress the admission of Jewish students to Stanford did, in fact, occur in the 1950s, and that the university for years afterward denied that this occurred.

The report discusses a 1953 university memo, the existence of which was reported in a blog last year, that expressed concern by university administrators about the number of Jewish students being admitted to Stanford. The report then documents a sharp drop in enrollments of students from two Southern California high schools known to have substantial populations of Jewish students – evidence that the university took action to suppress admission of Jewish students.

It is unclear how long this appalling antisemitic activity lasted or whether it extended to other schools or students. However, the report articulates how this effort to suppress Jewish enrollments had long-lasting effects and dissuaded some Jewish students from applying to Stanford in later years. And, the report shows that when questioned about its practices in later years, the university denied any anti-Jewish bias in admissions.

This ugly component of Stanford’s history, confirmed by this new report, is saddening and deeply troubling. As a university, we must acknowledge it and confront it as a part of our history, as repellent as it is, and seek to do better.

On behalf of Stanford University I wish to apologize to the Jewish community, and to our entire university community, both for the actions documented in this report to suppress the admission of Jewish students in the 1950s and for the university’s denials of those actions in the period that followed. These actions were wrong. They were damaging. And they were unacknowledged for too long. Today, we must work to do better, not only to atone for the wrongs of the past, but to ensure the supportive and bias-free experience for members of our Jewish community that we seek for all members of our Stanford community.

The details of the task force’s findings are summarized in this Stanford Report story and can be read in full in the task force report itself.

Many of you in our campus community and in our alumni community will be interested in learning more about the findings of the task force. To that end, we have organized a webinar that will be held tomorrow, Thursday, Oct. 13, at 12 noon Pacific time. Professor Ari Y. Kelman, the chair of the task force, will share the findings and answer your questions. Details are on this web page. I encourage you to participate.

In addition to its substantial archival investigation, the task force made a number of recommendations for enhancing Jewish life on campus today. We embrace these recommendations and welcome the task force’s thoughtful guidance on them.

The university is accepting the recommendations of the task force, with one modification described below, and implementation work will now begin. In addition to the institutional apology contained in this letter, our implementation plans include:

Ongoing advisory committee: The task force recommended an additional study of contemporary Jewish life at Stanford. We embrace the need for ongoing engagement with the Jewish community at Stanford to understand the needs of the community and to translate those needs into action in thoughtful and coordinated ways. Rather than just a study, however, we will commission a standing Jewish advisory committee comprised of students, staff, faculty, and alumni that will work with the Office of the Vice Provost for Institutional Equity, Access, and Community and the Office for Religious and Spiritual Life to address the needs of the Jewish community and partner with relevant campus offices on action steps. We believe this approach will provide a more dynamic, action-oriented, and sustainable means of addressing these needs than would be provided by a single study.

Education and training: We recognize the importance of addressing issues of potential bias against members of the Jewish community. A variety of anti-bias and related trainings are offered at Stanford and, as recommended, we will include antisemitism as one of the areas in which anti-bias education is provided.

ASSU resolution: The task force recommended that the Associated Students of Stanford University enforce a 2019 resolution adopted by the Undergraduate Senate to combat antisemitism on campus. We understand that the ASSU has expressed its intent to do so and has been in contact with the task force regarding implementation.

Jewish High Holidays: It is deeply regrettable that the beginning of our fall quarter coincided with Rosh Hashanah this year. As Provost Drell has said, we are working now with the appropriate Academic Council committees to address this issue for future academic calendars, which will require the approval of the Faculty Senate.

Housing and dining: The university, through its Residential & Dining Enterprises (R&DE) and Residential Education units, has worked with Hillel, the Office for Religious and Spiritual Life, and students to seek to accommodate the religious and cultural needs of Jewish students, including creating resources such as the Glatt Kosher Dining Program. However, we know more can be done to improve the resources we provide and the manner in which we make students aware of those resources. R&DE and ResEd will work with a cross-functional group of stakeholders to explore other resources that may be provided to support Jewish students.

R&DE and ResEd will work with a cross-functional group of stakeholders to explore other resources that may be provided to support Jewish students. University relationship with Hillel: As recommended, we will work to clarify the ongoing and important relationship of the university with Hillel, which is not an official Stanford entity but provides valuable support and services to members of the Stanford community.

Three final points: First, it would be natural to ask whether any of the historical anti-Jewish bias documented by the task force exists in our admission process today. We are confident it does not. We welcome, and we seek to support, a thriving Jewish community at Stanford as part of our diverse community of students and scholars from all backgrounds.

Second, this report is one part of our work to confront our institutional history. The renamings of some campus buildings and streets in recent years have been a part of this work. And, our initiatives under IDEAL addressing the needs and concerns of many other campus constituencies also have been a part of this work. This is a multi-faceted and ongoing effort.

Finally, I extend my great appreciation for the work of the task force that produced this report, as well as the university archivists who provided critical support for it. We asked the members of the task force to investigate this serious and sensitive matter through scholarly inquiry, with an unflinching commitment to examining the historical record as they found it. They have done so, and they have provided essential guidance for the university’s ongoing and necessary efforts to support the members of our Jewish community.

Sincerely,

Marc Tessier-Lavigne",Q4
https://www.econotimes.com/Afghanistan-Taliban-release-two-detained-American-nationals-in-goodwill-gesture-1647781,Afghanistan: Taliban release two detained American nationals in 'goodwill gesture',"The US State Department announced that Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers released two American nationals that were detained. The release, however, came on the same day the insurgent group moved to ban women from attending university.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the insurgent group freed two Americans who were detained in Afghanistan. Price told reporters that the release was a gesture of goodwill as no prisoner exchange was taking place or money was being exchanged.

Diplomats familiar with the matter told the Washington Post that the two Americans arrived in Qatar, and their identities were not disclosed to the public.

Price told reporters during the news conference that Washington was continuing to reiterate the need to release Americans that are still detained in Afghanistan but did not specify how many were still detained and who they were.

“We are in a position to welcome the release of two American nationals from detention in Afghanistan. We are providing these to US nationals with all appropriate assistance. They will soon be reunited with their loved ones,” said Price.

Price noted that the release was ironic considering the condemnation the insurgent group now faces after it started banning female students from attending universities on the same day. Price said, “it is a question for the Taliban themselves regarding the timing of this.”

The Taliban-backed ministry of higher education in Afghanistan said that female students will not be allowed to attend universities until further notice, another sign of increasingly restrictive policies against women and girls in the country.

US and UK envoys condemned the move by the insurgent group during a meeting of the UN Security Council in New York discussing Afghanistan.

“The Taliban cannot expect to be a legitimate member of the international community until they respect the rights of all Afghans, especially the human rights and fundamental freedom of women and girls,” said US deputy ambassador to the UN Robert Wood.

The Taliban has since defended the move, saying that it was to preserve “national interest” and to protect the “honor” of women. Several Taliban officials also claimed that the ban was temporary.",Q4

And not only are Republicans governing more than half the country, they are objectively doing a much better job at it than Democrats are. According to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average unemployment rate in the 25 states controlled completely by Republicans is just 7.2 percent, more than half a point lower than the national 7.9 percent unemployment rate. In the 14 states with full Democratic control, unemployment is 8.4 percent, a full half-point higher than the national average. The Republican state economies are growing faster too. According to the latest data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the real gross domestic product of the 25 Republican-controlled states has grown almost .25 points faster since 2008 than the real GDP of the 14 Democratic-controlled ones. And they aren’t doing it by going into to debt.

These trends suggest that the South will expand its dominance as the nation’s most populous region. In the 1950s, the South, the Northeast and the Midwest each had about the same number of people. Today the region is almost as populous as the Northeast and the Midwest combined. Perhaps more importantly, these states are nurturing families, in contrast to the Great Lakes states, the Northeast and California. Texas, for example, has increased its under 10 population by over 17% over the past decade; all the former confederate states, outside of Katrina-ravaged Mississippi and Louisiana, gained between 5% and 10%. On the flip side, under 10 populations declined in Illinois, Michigan, New York and California. Houston, Austin, Dallas, Charlotte, Atlanta and Raleigh also saw their child populations rise by at least twice the 10% rate of the rest country over the past decade while New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston and Chicago areas experienced declines. — Joel Kotkin

It was a wonderful cause, or even a lousy political cause. But whatever the original reason President X got his way and Y program…decades later…is still there. Now deemed essential. Untouchable.

http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20221004000406,'Ulysses' European tour seeks modern touch for Joyce's epic novel,"MARSEILLE -- A festival dedicated to James Joyce's novel ""Ulysses"" is touring 18 European cities, with artists and writers linking the work to contemporary issues such as immigration.

""Ulysses,"" published in 1922, counts among the 20th century's key novels, and its centenary has already sparked much celebration in Joyce's native Ireland.

But Liam Browne, co-artistic curator of ""Ulysses European Odyssey,"" said the tour is to go beyond the kind of literary fandom seen at home.

""What interested us was Joyce as a European figure, rather than an Irish figure,"" he told AFP on the margins of the tour event in Marseille on the southern French coast.

""In his imagination he was engaging with Dublin to write his novels but actually his day-to-day existence was in these European cities,"" Browne said. The crude language and sexual content in ""Ulysses"" meant there was no chance of it getting published in conservative 1920s Ireland or anywhere else in the English-speaking world.

It became the target of an obscenity trial in the United States, and was banned in Britain for more than a decade.

In the end, it was published in Paris by American poet Sylvia Plath, owner of the ""Shakespeare and Company"" bookshop which is still a gathering point for aspiring writers today.

The novel tells the story of a single day in the life of Dubliner Leopold Bloom, while Joyce links the day's events to Homer's ""Odyssey."" Scholars are still busy tracing the subtle connections.

Difficult to read

The book has a reputation for being difficult to understand, with the New York Times predicting in its 1922 review that ""not ten men or women out of a hundred can read 'Ulysses' through.""

Fans the world over still celebrate ""Bloomsday"" in honor of Joyce every year on June 16.

One of the aims of the European tour -- involving actors, directors, writers, musicians, photographers and even food experts -- is to connect the novel with today's burning topics.

""We wanted a multi-art response and we wanted the art engaging with society and social issues,"" Browne said. ""Nationalism, exile, sexuality and the place of women in society.""

Joyce, who grew up in Dublin, later lived in Paris, Trieste in Italy, and Zurich in Switzerland, where he died.

""We believed that the book would not have become what it was without Joyce's exile in Europe,"" said co-artistic curator Sean Doran. ""We are fascinated about this concept about home,"" he said.

Marseille, he said, was ""perfect to explore that subject, people here are coming from everywhere in the Mediterranean.""

An Anglo-Irish artist duo based in Marseille, Myles Quin and Gethan Dick, picked immigration and exile for their performance piece at the weekend, featuring recent arrivals from Afghanistan, Sudan, Algeria, Guinea and Syria in their depiction of the trauma of attempting to cross the Mediterranean in search for a better life.

""It seemed impossible to talk about them without making them actors in the performance,"" said Sophie Cattani, co-founder of local arts collective ""ildi ! eldi.""

Other venues for the tour, which is sponsored by the EU, include Athens, Budapest, Berlin and Istanbul.

Dublin will be its penultimate stop in 2024. The tour ends in Derry, Northern Ireland, with female artists from the other venues joining in the festival's finale. (AFP)",Q4
https://www.tnledger.com/knoxville/editorial/Article.aspx?id=158617,Panel rules public housing can’t ban guns,"VOL. 46 | NO. 42 | Friday, October 21, 2022

Public housing agencies in Tennessee can no longer include provisions in their leases that bar tenants from having guns in their homes, a state appeals panel has ruled.

A three-judge panel of the Tennessee Court of Appeals made the unanimous decision Oct. 14, saying that the prohibitions in public housing violate the Second Amendment rights of its residents.

In the ruling, the judges cited a prominent U.S. Supreme Court decision from June that expanded gun rights, while striking down a New York law requiring people to demonstrate a particular need for carrying a gun in order to get a license to carry a gun in a concealed way in public.

The Tennessee decision could set up an appeal to the state Supreme Court, which has a majority appointed by Republican governors.

The case centers on a lawsuit by Kinsley Braden, who signed a lease agreement with Columbia Housing & Redevelopment Corporation in April 2018 that barred him from having a gun on the premises.

In November 2020, housing officials sought to evict Braden when they found out he had been keeping a handgun in his residence at the Creekside Acres low-income housing complex. Lower court judges ruled in favor of Columbia Housing in the initial case and an appeal, then Braden sought another review, the ruling states.

In the latest decision, Judge Frank Clement wrote that “a total ban on the ability of law-abiding residents – like Mr. Braden – to possess a handgun within their public housing unit for the purpose of self-defense is unconstitutional under the Second Amendment.”

Dolly’s strategy: ‘Give from my heart’

Dolly Parton laughs at the idea that she is some sort of secret philanthropist.

Sure, social media sleuths did piece together that the country superstar had been quietly paying for the band uniforms of many Tennessee high schools for years.

And yes, it did take decades for her to reveal that she used the songwriting royalties she earned from Whitney Houston’s version of “I Will Always Love You” to purchase a strip mall in Nashville to support the surrounding Black neighborhood in her honor.

Oh, and it did eventually come out that Parton had donated $1 million for research that helped create the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19.

“I don’t do it for attention,” she told The Associated Press in an interview, shortly before she received the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy at Gotham Hall in New York City Oct. 13. “But look! I’m getting a lot of attention by doing it.”

In fact, Parton believes she gets too much attention for her philanthropic work – which ranges from promoting childhood literacy to supporting those affected by natural disasters and providing numerous college scholarships through her Dollywood Foundation.

In her Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy speech, Parton said she doesn’t really have a strategy for her donations.

“I just give from my heart,” she says. “I never know what I’m going to do or why I’m gonna do it. I just see a need and if I can fill it, then I will.”

Dept. of Agriculture partners for local food support

The Tennessee Department of Agriculture announced its participation in a program that will increase purchases of local foods from Tennessee’s underserved farmers and producers and get it to those who need it most.

TDA will participate in the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, established by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Marketing Service and authorized by the American Rescue Plan.

The initiative aims to maintain and improve agricultural supply chain resiliency to support local, regional and socially disadvantaged farmers and producers through the purchase of locally grown fresh foods, food products, and beverages.

With LFPA funding, TDA will partner with Tennessee’s Feeding America Food Banks in their efforts to procure high-quality foods and beverages produced within the state or within 400 miles of delivery destination. These healthy food items will be distributed to citizens experiencing food insecurity statewide.

Look Rock Campground reopens after nine years

A campground at Great Smoky Mountains National Park that has been closed for nine years has been reopened, park officials said.

Look Rock Campground is a 68-site facility that provides camping along one of the park’s most scenic drives, according to Superintendent Cassius Cash.

The campground opened Saturday and remains available through Nov. 13.

“We are grateful for the voices who supported us in our efforts to secure the needed funding for repairs, including the Friends of the Smokies and their donors,” Cash said in a news release.

Look Rock Campground and Picnic Area were closed in 2013 after the water utility systems failed. The picnic area reopened with limited services after the park received funds in 2019 to install an accessible vault toilet.

The water system has now been completely replaced, with access to flush toilets and potable water. Campground sites were rehabilitated. Ten sites were renovated to accommodate larger recreational vehicles and offer the first electric and water hookups in a park campground, the park said.

Marceno made the announcement in a press conference on Tuesday. Reportedly, the four individuals were arrested on charges of burglary of an unoccupied structure during a state of emergency. The four alleged looters were Omar Mejia Ortiz, 33, Valerie Celeste Salcedo Mena, 26 and 20-year-olds Brandon Mauricio Araya and Steve Eduardo Sanchez Araya, according to Fox News. Three of the four were reportedly in the U.S. illegally.

""All three of these subjects are here illegally in this country — Robert Mena, Brandon Araya, Stephen Araya — all arrested for stealing bottles on Fort Myers Beach during the hurricane. They were located and arrested. And I'm going to tell I'm not tolerating it again,” Marceno reportedly said during the press conference.

In a Sunday press conference, Marceno had said that he has a “zero tolerance” policy on looting.

“This last thing our residents need to worry about, the great state of Florida residents, is people looting,” Marceno said in the press conference. “I took a very aggressive stance on zero tolerance. We have deputies from all over the state with our local, state and federal partners to ensure there’s no looting.”

Several times, Marceno noted that people who choose to loot in the aftermath of the hurricane will likely be “carried out” upon entering a storm-ravaged building.

“When I say zero tolerance, I stand with our great residents in zero tolerance because law and order and safety and security is No.1. If someone makes the error, the error to walk into someone’s house and rob, steal and loot, they’re going to be carried out. Carried out. And I’m certain about it.”

Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis responded to the report about the looters who were in the U.S. illegally.

“If I could, I would take those three looters, I would drag them out by the collars and I would send them back to where they came from,” he said during a briefing on Tuesday, according to the New York Post.

“I mean, they should be prosecuted, but they need to be sent back to their home country. They should not be here at all,” he added. “These are people that are foreigners, they’re illegally in our country — and not only that, they tried to loot and ransack in the aftermath of a natural disaster.”

DeSantis said late last week that Florida is a “Second Amendment State,” a warning to those who might loot homes and businesses during the hurricane.

“Don’t even think about looting. Don’t even think about taking advantage of people in this vulnerable situation,” DeSantis said. “You never know what may be lurking behind somebody’s home…we’re a Second Amendment State.”

https://www.heritage.org/life/commentary/declaring-heartbeat-act-unconstitutional-georgia-judge-gets-law-flatly-wrong,"In Declaring “Heartbeat Act” Unconstitutional, Georgia Judge Gets Law Flatly Wrong","A Fulton County, Georgia, Superior Court judge on Tuesday ruled that key provisions of the state’s six-week abortion ban were “plainly unconstitutional” and blocked the law’s further enforcement.

In granting plaintiff abortion groups’ motion for partial judgment on the constitutionality of HB 481, Georgia’s 2019 Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act, Judge Robert McBurney had to engage in some impressive legal contortions to reach the outcome he so clearly wanted.

The case is Sistersong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Coalition v. Georgia, and with his ruling, the state’s heartbeat abortion ban—in effect since July of this year—was put on ice. But this isn’t the first time the constitutionality of Georgia’s LIFE Act has been up for consideration.

A brief review of the case history illustrates just how wrong McBurney was.

After its enactment in 2019, a group of abortion rights advocacy groups and abortionists sued to stop the LIFE Act’s enforcement, arguing, among other things, that it was an unconstitutional violation of women’s 14th Amendment substantive due process right to abortion as recognized in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey.

The abortionists won at the trial court, with the judge ruling that Roe and Casey prevented states from banning abortion before viability—considered to be around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy—something Georgia’s law would do.

The abortionists were granted a preliminary injunction that prevented state officials from enforcing any provision of the law. The Georgia state officials appealed.

While the case was pending on appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, the Supreme Court took up Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. So, the 11th Circuit decided to wait to issue its ruling in the case until after the Supreme Court had issued its Dobbs ruling.

In Dobbs, the Supreme Court overruled Roe and Casey, holding that “it is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.”

With Dobbs, Sistersong’s battleship was sunk. The 11th Circuit noted that “Dobbs abrogates many previous decisions of this Court” and that an “intervening decision of the Supreme Court overrules our precedents whenever the decision is clearly on point.”

How much more “on point” could a case be than Dobbs?

Based on that, the abortionists’ claim—that Georgia’s law violates women’s substantive due process right to abortion—failed. The Supreme Court held in Dobbs that there is no such right and that Roe was “egregiously wrong” to invent it.

What that means is that any state abortion restriction will pass muster if “there is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought that it would serve legitimate state interests.” One of those interests, the court explained, is “respect for and preservation of” unborn life “at all stages of development.”

Based on that, the 11th Circuit held that Georgia’s heartbeat law was rational, and the injunction preventing its enforcement was lifted.

But the abortion rights groups in Georgia tried again—this time in state court—joining a flurry of state court litigation on laws nationwide as abortion advocates tried to secure its access coast to coast.

This time, they got the outcome they wanted, with McBurney ruling that there was “no legal basis” for Georgia to bar abortions after six weeks, and neither the state government nor local governments could enforce a ban on abortions after a heartbeat is detected.

How did McBurney reach such a head-scratching conclusion? By suspending the realities of time and space and pretending that Dobbs didn’t exist. He argued that the LIFE Act had to be considered under the legal environment that existed when it was enacted—before the ruling in Dobbs—writing:

At that time—the spring of 2019—everywhere in America, including Georgia, it was unequivocally unconstitutional for governments—federal, state, or local—to ban abortions before viability. … [T]he law did not become the law of Georgia when it was enacted, and it is not the law of Georgia now.

In Dobbs, the nation’s highest court determined that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, never did, and that Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey were egregiously wrong in holding otherwise. That was the court’s clear, authoritative pronouncement, which binds all lower courts.

Rather than a “constitutional right” to abortion, there was nothing more than a series of bad court decisions ham-handedly pulling a “right” out of thin air by applying Roe’s flawed rationale over and over again for nearly 50 years until the Supreme Court put an end to the madness.

McBurney’s opinion was heavy on commentary. Among other doozies, he argued that Dobbs “is not somehow ‘more correct’ than” Roe or Casey, complained that Dobbs was full of “frothy language disparaging the views espoused by previous Justices,” and referred sarcastically to “the magic of Dobbs” and its lack of “some mystical higher wisdom.”

McBurney is clearly no fan of Dobbs. But for officers of the court, sworn to impartially uphold the Constitution, McBurney should know his personal preferences don’t matter. Courts are not some sort of “superlegislature.”

As Dobbs makes clear, the business of making law is strictly the purview of the legislative bodies. Courts, on the other hand, are simply bound to interpret and apply the law, whether or not they like the outcome it demands.

As for the state of Georgia, Kara Richardson, spokesperson for Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, said the office had already taken legal action in response to McBurney’s ruling and filed an appeal with the Georgia Supreme Court.

Richardson said that state officials “will continue to fulfill our duty to defend the laws of our state in court.” Carr’s office added that the “ruling places the personal beliefs of a judge over the will of the legislature and people of Georgia.”

Dobbs drove the final nail into Roe’s coffin. A judge like McBurney who undertakes to “apply [Dobbs] faithfully and completely”—but does so contending that only post-Dobbs laws would have to abide by that precedent—might need to be reminded of that.

Officers from the state police and DEEP responded and shot the bear, authorities said.

The boy's grandfather, James Butler, of Morris, told the Republican-American of Waterbury, his grandson was playing near a trampoline when the large male bear came out of thick woods near the house and grabbed the boy by the leg, CBS News reported.

Bulter, who uses a wheelchair, said the whole incident was harrowing, especially when he looked up and saw the bear trying to drag his grandson across the lawn, CBS News said.

Butler threw a metal bar at the bear's head, he told the newspaper.

The bear then released the boy, but came back and grabbed him a second time. A neighbor heard the boy's screams and ran over and chased the bear using a pipe and yelling, CBS News said.

Once inside the house, Bulter told the Republican-American the bear returned, came up the wheelchair ramp, and looked through a screen door.

The bear was shot by a short time later.

Butler and his wife, Christina Anderson, said the boy suffered a puncture wound to his thigh, bite marks on a foot and ankle, and claw marks on his back.

DEEP officials said if you see a bear in your yard or near you, go into a house, garage, or other structure. If the bear persistently approaches, go on the offensive—shout, wave your arms, and throw sticks or rocks.

The recompilation proposal received over 886,000 votes (76.5%), according to unofficial returns compiled by the Alabama Secretary of State’s office. Just over 272,000 voters (23.5%) voted against it.

“I believe we’re sending a message,” said Sen. Merika Coleman, D-Pleasant Grove, the sponsor of the measure, who said she was “overjoyed” at the passage. “We do have our challenges, but we are doing all we can. We are a diverse society. We support diversity, and we are open for business.”

The vote was the third attempt in the past 20 years to strip racist language from the 1901 Constitution, framed to disenfranchise Blacks and poor whites.

“And what is it we want to do?” John Knox, the president of the constitutional convention, told the delegates as the convention opened in May 1901. “Why, it is within the limits imposed by the Federal Constitution, to establish white supremacy in this state.”

The Constitution was passed through fraud by white planters in the Black Belt. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to block the voting provisions in 1903's Giles v. Harris, which closed off challenges to voting restrictions in Jim Crow constitutions for six decades.

The recompilation does not alter any other provisions of the Constitution, such as the severe caps on property taxes and the centralizing of power in Montgomery.

The recompilation, approved by a committee chaired by Coleman, will:

In the Constitution’s ban on slavery, strike a clause allowing slavery “for the punishment of crime, of which the party shall have been duly convicted.” The language was the legal basis for Alabama’s infamous convict-labor system, used until 1928 to arrest Black Alabamians and force them into difficult and deadly work.

Remove language directing poll tax revenues to counties for educational purposes. The poll tax was a key element in the state’s disenfranchisement scheme. Voters had to pay any back poll taxes before they could cast a ballot.

Strike language from a 1956 amendment to the Constitution, passed amid white hysteria over Brown v. Board of Education, that authorized the Legislature to allow children to “attend schools provided for their own race,” as well as a provision allowing the Legislature to intervene in schools in the name of “peace and order.” “Peace and order” was a dog whistle phrase for violence used by segregationists; Alabama Attorney General John Patterson said in 1956 that Montgomery could not maintain “peace and order … if, by court decree, a Negro man is permitted to sit by a white woman.”

An earlier attempt in 2004 that would also have stripped language saying there is no right to public education in Alabama drew the opposition of former Chief Justice Roy Moore and his allies, leading to a narrow defeat. A 2012 proposal that would have kept the school language in drew the opposition of Black legislators and education groups, leading to its defeat.

The proposal also reorders constitutional amendments according to the county they affect. The Constitution does not allow home rule, and the Legislature must often pass amendments to address particular county needs. Voters have amended the Constitution more than 975 times, making it the longest governing document in the United States, and making it difficult to find amendments specific to counties.

“You will be able to find that in one spot, instead of searching for that,” Coleman said.

Efforts to change the state Constitution have gone back as far as 1915. The Legislature has authorized relatively minor changes to the document but has never allowed proposals for a new constitution or new constitutional convention to move forward, due mainly to the opposition of groups like the Alabama Farmers Federation. Coleman said she was not optimistic about big changes in the future, but said they could look at replicating the recompilation approach.

“Can we take bites out of it?” she said. “Sure. This was a bite. This was a big one.”

Whatever it was — call it chance or call it Providence, but the Watsons point to the latter — that launched them into the national spotlight, the Frazeysburg family of five most recently found themselves strolling across the stage at The Jennifer Hudson Show to an eruption of applause from an enthusiastic studio audience.

Billed simply as “Ohio’s Watson Family!” in the show’s ticker, the Watsons — Jason, Anne and their three children, Lily, Skye and Pax — were contacted by JHud producers after a story about their Frazeysburg-based “mobile food pantry,” a secondhand ice cream truck they purchased to deliver lunches and ice cream to local children, was featured in People Magazine.

The family was flown to Los Angeles for their appearance on the show, which aired earlier this month

“We just kept saying, ‘We’re from Frazeysburg. We’re just feeding kids,’” Jason recalled of the red carpet treatment the family received during their stay. “They treated us like celebrities.”

Ice cream truck food pantry: GoFundMe led to national publicity for Watson family

Their story has been making waves since August, when crowdfunding website GoFundMe spotlighted them for its GoFundMe Heroes segment.

That story and an accompanying podcast interview led to the People feature, which ran in September — the same issue whose cover featured Queen Elizabeth.

Interview requests from media outlets across the country continue to pour in, and the Watsons oblige as often as they deem sensible for the sake of the mission close to their hearts.

While all the fame feels a bit sudden, the Watsons have been hard at work since 2016, when they first became aware that food insecurity was a close-to-home problem.

“Kids were coming to school hungry. They would line up outside at the doors because they wanted to be the first ones to eat breakfast because they hadn't eaten the night before,” said Jason, a Frazeysburg native who returned to his hometown to take a job as a physical education teacher.

His wife was the one who resolved to take the next step.

During one particularly restless night, she found herself praying for the children who needed food.

“God just talked to me throughout the night and said, ‘Anne, you're the answer to your own prayer, so you’ve got to go do it,’” she said.

That week, the Watsons came across a room in the old Frazeysburg Elementary School building whose owner charged them only for electricity. Already lined with shelves, it was perfect for storing food donations — and thus, AIM Outreach was born.

Food pantry shows Frazeysburg community generosity

As a family, the Watsons would spend Mondays at the pantry, handing out food to anyone in need. The community kept them supplied with donations and a pool of faithful volunteers, many of whom continue with the organization to this day.

“We decided we wanted the community to get in on it and it not be just us,” Anne said. “And we just wanted it to be a place where if anybody showed up that needed food, they could get food. So it's community funded all the way.”

The pantry gained momentum. During the summer, the Watsons added programming for children, bringing in local teachers to lead activities such as painting and archery. They hosted a family movie night and scheduled guest appearances by the fire department; anything to bring out more families.

“We were always trying to think of not just, ‘Come up and eat,’ but ‘How can we get the kids to come and do something beneficial?’” Jason said.

And then 2020 brought COVID.

Faced with lockdowns, social distancing regulations and concerns about community spread of the virus, the Watsons were left to think creatively about new ways to serve their community.

Which is how the ice cream truck came rolling into the picture.

As the pandemic raged on, Jason used Facebook to reach out to an ice cream truck owner in Columbus to see if he’d be willing to partner with them to deliver ice cream, free of charge, to the community; the Watsons would take care of the bill.

He agreed, and they had an unforgettable day.

“It was the most fun thing we ever did. We gave it to kids and adults and anybody that would come up,” Jason said. “The (ice cream truck owner), we got along so well, and he loved the community and he loved what we were doing … in the end, he was like, ‘Hey, I've got two extra trucks. I'd be willing to sell one of them if you guys want it.’”

That fall, the Watson family became the proud owners of a mint-colored ice cream truck with which they delivered not just ice cream, but also meals and a generous helping of hope to their community.

“For us as a ministry, it’s easier to meet people where they are instead of always asking them to come to you,” Jason said.

In June 2022, the family launched their GoFundMe campaign upon learning the vehicle was in need of repairs; supporters came through in a big way, providing more than $12,000 to date to help with upkeep.

And so the Watsons continue in their mission.

Whether it’s passing out food at the stationary pantry or hitting the road with hot lunches and ice cream in the summer, their heart is for their community and its children. In addition to teaching physical education at Dresden Elementary School, Jason serves as a pastor at Crossroads Christian Church in Newark. Anne is a librarian at Licking Valley Primary School; Lily, Pax and Skye attend Licking Valley schools.

As the family sat together on Jennifer Hudson’s talk show set, the vivacious hostess asked them what people can do in their own communities to fight food insecurity.

“Find your passion, find what the need is in your community, and hit the ground running,” Anne, holding her husband’s hand, replied.

Jason agreed, adding, “Find whatever your passion is and say, ‘How can I use this to serve other people?’” — a response met with audience applause.

The Watsons aren’t sure where the food pantry will take them next, though they have dreams of a free cafe where they can interact with and feed more people. In the meantime, they’ve enjoyed seeing the way their children have jumped on board to help with the calling to minister to their community in a practical way.

“We're just an average family just saying yes to something that anybody else can do,” Anne said. “And if that spurs on another person or family to do something like this — it doesn't have to be exactly, but whatever they are called to do and say yes to — then we did what we were supposed to do.”

https://www.khaleejtimes.com/business/germanys-rwe-buys-con-edison-clean-energy-in-6-8b-us-shift,Germany's RWE buys Con Edison clean energy in $6.8b US shift,"Germany's largest power producer RWE has agreed to buy Con Edison's Clean Energy Businesses for $6.8 billion, nearly doubling RWE's renewables portfolio in the United States, the world's second-biggest renewables market.

The purchase will be partly funded by RWE issuing a $2.43 billion convertible bond to a Qatar Investment Authority unit, through which the QIA will become a 9.1 per cent shareholder in RWE.

Con Edison said it was scrapping plans to issue up to $850 million in new shares this year and withdrawing equity guidance for the next two years. It said the deal would allow it to focus on its core utility business and New York's clean energy shift.

The transaction will nearly double RWE's US renewables portfolio to more than seven gigawatts (GW) and grow its regional project pipeline by seven GW to more than 24 GW.

After the takeover, solar will account for 40 per cent of RWE's US portfolio, up from three per cent now, presentation slides showed.

""Our equity capital measure is the basis for financing the acquisition of Con Edison CEB and of the additional green growth in the years to come,"" RWE chief executive Markus Krebber said.

""I am delighted that QIA is supporting RWE's accelerated growth ambitions with their capital commitment,"" Krebber added in a statement released late on Saturday.

The deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2023, will make RWE the fourth-largest renewables player in the U.S. market, which plays a key role in its green expansion, though still far behind largest player NextEra, which has some 58 GW of generating capacity.

US expansion

RWE's expansion in the United States comes as Germany is battling the impact of a complete halt in Russian gas supplies, which has already triggered the nationalisation of its smaller competitor Uniper.

Activist energy fund Enkraft Capital, which owns 0.15 per cent of RWE, said it was ""incomprehensible"" how RWE could spend seven billion euros on an M&A deal in the US ""amidst the biggest energy crisis Germany has ever seen"".

But QIA CEO Mansoor bin Ebrahim Al Mahmoud said it was proud to support RWE's efforts to become a global renewables leader.

QIA's investment expands Qatar's relationship with Europe's largest economy, which already includes stakes in Volkswagen , Deutsche Bank and Porsche.

The deal, the biggest for RWE since the break-up of former division Innogy announced in 2018, will be earnings accretive right away, giving RWE additional core earnings (EBITDA) of $600 million a year.

It comes nearly a year after RWE fleshed out its global renewables roadmap, which includes 50 billion euros ($49 billion) of gross investments by 2030, with 15 billion earmarked for the United States.

Con Edison CEO Timothy Cawley said RWE was ""well-positioned to accelerate the growth of renewable energy across the United States.""

Con Edison was advised on the deal by Barclays and Latham and Watkins.

RWE also confirmed plans to pay a dividend of 0.90 euro per share for 2022. - Reuters",Q4

I understand, as I've also had several inexplicable experiences over the years and suspect you've likely had some, too. If so, let me know details.

Tell-tale rainbow

Thomas Rousey of Fayetteville said that years ago he and his family were living in Jonesboro and having issues with their teenage son, so problematic they'd sought family counseling.

As a computer technician, his job led him across much of northeast Arkansas.

When returning from a repair job in Mountain Home in the rain, he often took alternate routes on return trips to Jonesboro.

""On this day, I was somewhere east of Walnut Ridge on a country road when the rain stopped and the clouds cleared to the west,"" he said. ""I saw a single building off in the distance when there occurred the most perfectly shaped, beautiful rainbow.

""One leg of the rainbow fell on the building, illuminating what turned out to be a small white country church. It didn't occur to me until much later that this was a message from God that he had heard my prayers and everything would be all right.

""And, sure enough, it was!

""I still see that country church when I kneel to pray. Today, I'm praying for your speedy recovery! I look forward to reading your columns, so please keep writing!""

Peter Hartstein of Little Rock wrote: ""Dear Mr. Masterson, I always read your column, which is very good. I wanted to send you an experience that I had on July 26, 1944, in Stuttgart, Germany. I am a naturalized citizen and arrived in Little Rock on Dec. 1, 1947.

""On July 26, 1944, our family was in our apartment when a bombing raid occurred. We made a decision to leave and go outside, where we discovered the entire area, for several blocks in each direction, was on fire.

""We didn't know in which direction to go. At that moment someone with a wagon came along and loaded us on, then threw some wet blankets over us and got us to safety, which was only one block away. But we could not have known that because all of the buildings were on fire.

""The next day my sister asked our mother, 'Who was that man with the wagon?' Mother answered, 'God sent an angel!' That was no coincidence!""

Sensed son's danger

A reader who asked to be identified as a friend in Arkansas wrote to say that 28 years ago he'd been preoccupied with a project when an inexplicable sense of terror surged through him.

""I looked at my watch and saw it was 1:08 p.m. I knew something was terribly wrong.

""I was nearly frozen physically and my mind was frozen from panic and terror. After maybe 15 or 20 seconds, it went away.

""In another two or three minutes I was at complete peace. I realized something had occurred out of the ordinary, but also didn't give it much more thought.

""At dinner that night in Malvern, my oldest son, who had pulled a fifth-wheel trailer to pick up a load for me in Fort Smith, casually mentioned he'd had a problem coming back home.

""He said his load was top-heavy and he blew a right front tire and locked the brakes, which pulled him off the highway down through a ditch and up an embankment until he could steer into a field without turning it over.

""After recovering, he saw a farmer plowing two fields over in the distance, and asked him to tow him back to the road. I said, you could have been killed. He said he thought so, too.

""Then I asked what time this happened. Having purchased food a few minutes earlier, he pulled the receipt from his pocket and said it would have been a few minutes after 1 p.m.

""Mike, I knew the exact time it was happening. I have had one or two other people I was close to with whom I can occasionally connect this way on trivial things. But nothing of this magnitude.

""I have thought about it many times and how this could happen. We know there are five senses: sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell, which is how we know anything is happening around us. What if there are more senses we're unaware of?""

Voice shouts 'wait!'

A friend, Ruthie O'Neal, tells of the time she'd pulled to a stop sign and was about to follow her usual practice of stomping on the gas and pulling away quickly as the light changed when a disembodied voice from inside the car clearly and loudly said, ""Wait!""

She hesitated momentarily, just as a dump truck came barreling through the intersection and would have broadsided her where she otherwise would have been.

""I can't explain it, but it happened, and that mysterious voice probably saved my life,"" she said.

https://www.amren.com/news/2022/10/racial-pseudoscience-on-the-faculty/,Racial Pseudoscience on the Faculty,"Cid Standifer, Chronicle of Higher Education, October 13, 2022

Liam O’Brien was a master’s student in political science at Cleveland State University in 2019 when a screenshot from a new article, titled “ Global Ancestry and Cognitive Ability ,” crawled across his Twitter feed.

To the untrained eye, the abstract was highly technical. “Using the ancestry-adjusted association between MTAG eduPGS and g from the monoracial African-American sample as an estimate of the transracially unbiased validity of eduPGS (B = 0.124),” the authors wrote, “the results suggest that as much as 20%-25% of the race difference in g can be naïvely explained by known cognitive ability-related variants.”

The argument dressed up in that statistical jargon? That Black people are genetically disposed to be less intelligent than white people.

O’Brien was disturbed to see that debunked racial-hierarchy arguments popular in the late 19th and early 20th century had a toehold in modern academe. Scientifically rigorous research arguing that intelligence is inherited is itself controversial, but few geneticists take seriously the claim that intelligence is racially linked.

His dismay turned to outrage when he discovered that one of the authors, Bryan J. Pesta, was a tenured professor in Cleveland State’s business school. O’Brien’s home institution was essentially providing a soapbox for racist pseudoscience.

He had a history of political activism, so he did what came naturally, talking to students and professors about Pesta’s article, and trying to get him censured.

“I didn’t know anything about academia and how difficult it would be to do anything about it,” O’Brien said. Among his acquaintances at the university, he said, “I didn’t encounter a single person who knew anything about him.”

Publications like Pesta’s may fly under the academic radar, but can seep into popular misperceptions of race and lend them a scholarly veneer. Pesta was heavily involved, for example, in editing a 2010 version of Wikipedia’s article on race and intelligence, according to the site’s discussion-forum archives. At the time, the article cited both Pesta’s work and that of other “racial hereditarians.” The racist manifesto of Peyton Gendron, the man accused of murdering 10 Black people at a Buffalo grocery store this year, cited some of Pesta’s racial-hereditarian colleagues and predecessors.

Despite nearly a dozen publications over more than a decade arguing for the intellectual inferiority of Black people, Pesta earned merit pay for research and eventually promotion and tenure at Cleveland State. Finally, this year, after researchers at other institutions filed complaints, the university fired him.

But those complaints weren’t about the legitimacy of his research.

How Pesta got fired, and why it took so long, shows that racist pseudoscience can go unnoticed and unchallenged on a campus for years, even as it makes the rounds among lay readers. It also points to the difficulties faced by legitimate genetic scientists intent on protecting the reputation of their field.

Bryan Pesta had spent most of his adult life at Cleveland State University. He earned his bachelor’s, an M.A., and a master’s in labor relations and human services at CSU, according to his archived faculty page , before receiving a doctorate in the psychology of cognitive aging at the nearby University of Akron in 1997.

Pesta’s Google Scholar profile shows an eclectic collection of nearly 40 publications on management, labor, and aging across a handful of journals, along with articles on race and IQ as early as 2008. He was awarded tenure in 2010 and, by the time “Global Ancestry and Cognitive Ability” was published, in the fall of 2019, was earning more than $170,000 a year — an amount that could go far in Cleveland, where the median annual income is less than $22,000.

Cleveland State is on the East Side of the heavily segregated city, and residents of the surrounding neighborhoods are nearly all Black. With Black students making up about 13 percent of the student body, the campus is more diverse than its state-college counterparts scattered throughout Ohio, and it’s popular among Cleveland high-school graduates who want to study close to home.

A look at Pesta’s RateMyProfessors page shows students generally rated him very highly, describing him as “hilarious,” “interesting,” and “easy.” One warned: “If you’re easily offended, you might not like some of his jokes, especially when he compares certain graphs to phallic symbols.” But none of the 74 reviews complains about racism.

The Chronicle reached out to 10 Black students who graduated from the business school with bachelor’s or master’s degrees in 2022. Of the three who replied, none said they were familiar with Pesta.

“Literally 100s of Black students have taken my classes,” Pesta wrote in an email to The Chronicle. “I’ve won merit pay for teaching many times. I was regard [sic] as among the best teachers in the business college.”

“If I were racist, or even overly political,” he wrote, “I submit I would have been exposed by now.”

{snip}

Many of his papers about race ran in Intelligence, a peer-reviewed journal that has drawn fire for publishing other racial-hereditarian arguments. Three of his articles appeared in Mankind Quarterly, which a writer in The New York Review of Books once called “a notorious journal of ‘racial history’ founded, and funded, by men who believe in the genetic superiority of the white race.” Two were published in the Journal of Intelligence, an international, open-access periodical that advertises its quick review and publication process.

{snip}

But in study after study, Pesta and his co-authors reference “race” without any caveats, and break subjects into racial categories of Black, white, Asian, and occasionally Hispanic, or try to determine how much genetic material they have from each category.

Pesta’s papers also consistently maintain that racial gaps in test scores can’t be explained by factors like discrimination or economic status. In 2008, for example, he published an article in Intelligence arguing that the gap between Black and white students’ IQ scores could be explained entirely by Black students’ lower intelligence rather than any bias in intelligence measures.

{snip}

When asked about Pesta’s research more broadly, the chair of Pesta’s department, the management professor Timothy DeGroot, defended its legitimacy. “I find it distasteful,” he wrote in an email. But “that is not the point,” he said. “There is a long history of research in this area.”

{snip}

O’Brien, the political-science graduate student, tried not to let Pesta’s work go ignored. He gathered students from various activist groups to make an action plan. One group put out an email blast inviting interested students to a Zoom meeting on the subject.

{snip}

Ultimately it didn’t matter. Just as the organizing effort was getting off the ground, the first cases of Covid-19 were found in Ohio. The campus was shut down. The campaign sputtered. O’Brien finished his master’s degree online and never returned to campus.

But across the country, geneticists at other universities had set in motion institutional processes focused not on Pesta’s racist claims but on his violation of the norms and regulations of academe.

He had already been on one geneticist’s radar when “Global Ancestry and Cognitive Ability” was published in Psych.

Luke Miller (a pseudonym) is an early-career scientist who has long been rankled by racial hereditarians. As a geneticist, he said, he feels a responsibility to combat the harm done by the fringes of the scientific community. (The Chronicle has used a pseudonym for Miller and left some other early-career researchers in this article unnamed because they fear professional repercussions.)

“Global Ancestry and Cognitive Ability” stood out from similar articles Miller normally saw. The first thing that struck him was its publication in a journal from MDPI, a mainstream publisher, unlike typical vehicles for racial hereditarianism like Mankind Quarterly.

More alarmingly, the paper cited data from the National Institutes of Health’s Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) . The federal agency has strict controls governing who may use its data and how. It struck Miller as improbable that the NIH had given Pesta’s paper the green light, or would have even given him access to the data, if the agency had known what he planned to do with it.

Genetic data is intensely personal. With a person’s genome, in theory, one could deduce a person’s hair, eye, and skin color; diagnose genetic illnesses that haven’t manifested themselves yet; or even tie the person to crime-scene evidence.

Most of the NIH’s requirements for data use are meant to ensure that information is protected. Only specific people named on the data-use application and approved by the NIH are allowed to use the data. The researcher must get special permission to use cloud-computing systems. Failing that, NIH guidelines instruct researchers to “make sure these files are never exposed to the internet” after they’re downloaded from the NIH.

And principal investigators have to submit a request explaining what they’ll be studying. Pesta submitted several in 2018. One, submitted in December that year, said he planned to study whether polygenetic scores — estimates of how likely people are to have a trait or disease based on their genetic profile — were accurate across different ethnic groups if used to predict educational attainment and schizophrenia, since the scores had mainly been studied in people of European descent. Another request said he planned to focus on differences in brain morphology between sexes. A third said he planned to study whether genes predicted mental illnesses like depression and schizophrenia differently in different ethnic groups. None said he would study whether one racial group was genetically less intelligent than another.

Miller was tapped into a network of researchers across the country who felt similarly about hereditarianism. Together, four of them combed the methodology section of Pesta’s article and compiled evidence that he had violated NIH policies.

According to the paper’s methodology section, the data was uploaded to at least two servers: the Michigan Imputation Server , a University of Michigan program that deduces genes that haven’t been included in a sample; and HIrisPlex-S , a web application that deduces phenotypes like eye, hair, and skin color from genetic data. While only Pesta received permission to use the NIH data, and named none of his co-authors in the requests, Miller said he and the other whistle-blowers had inferred that others would have had to have access to it to do the analysis the paper described.

In September 2019 the group of four scientists signed letters listing their concerns to both the NIH and Cleveland State. They also alerted the researchers who had gathered the original data. Documents leaked to The Chronicle by someone knowledgeable about the subsequent investigations, as well as interviews with whistle-blowers, detail what happened next.

{snip}

The NIH began an investigation in September 2019. In 2021, the agency sent a letter to the university confirming that Pesta’s use of the NIH data to examine cognitive functioning had violated his data-use agreement, since he had received approval to study mental health, not intelligence. The NIH also found that Pesta had failed to report the publication, as required, until he submitted his close-out report for the project, in February 2021, more than a year after the article came out in Psych. And it found that he had violated his data-use agreement by uploading restricted data to an “unapproved online forensic DNA-phenotyping service.”

{snip}

The letter set a June 2021 deadline for the university to destroy all initially approved copies of the genetic data and find out whether any unapproved copies of the data had been made. The agency also revoked Pesta’s permission to use NIH data for any existing projects, and banned him from obtaining any NIH data for the next three years.

The NIH declined to comment on the investigation, saying it did not discuss whether investigations were in progress against individuals. When a reporter pointed out that the inquiry appeared no longer to be going on, a spokesperson replied, “Our prior response still stands.”

In line with its union agreement, Cleveland State set up a faculty committee to investigate Pesta’s alleged violations of university policy. It was not until September 2021, according to Miller, that CSU replied to his and the other whistle-blowers’ 2019 complaint, asking to interview them. After reviewing documentation and interviewing Pesta twice, the committee uncovered a raft of additional sins.

According to a letter sent to Pesta by the then provost, Laura Bloomberg — who has since been tapped as CSU’s president — the university confirmed the NIH’s findings. It also found Pesta had lied to a staff member in CSU’s research office when he said the data would be kept in a university-owned laptop and he would be the only one with access.

Instead, the letter said, Pesta put the data on a machine purchased with funds from the Human Phenome Diversity Foundation, of which he was president.

Pesta said he had requested and received approval from both Cleveland State and the NIH to store the data on a home computer.

“Those bastards totally ignored me when I pointed it out,” he added.

{snip}

In an interview with The Chronicle, Pesta said all the allegations against him were false, except that he had uploaded the data to a phenotyping service.

“I should have gotten what’s called prior approval to upload these data to that server, but it just didn’t occur to me that I needed to do that,” he said. He added that a paper published in Nature had used the same phenotyping service, so he believed it was secure.

Bloomberg ultimately found that Pesta’s conduct had damaged the university’s reputation and could impede other professors’ ability to do research.

Cleveland State declared that Pesta had been incompetent or dishonest in teaching or scholarship; neglected his duty, and engaged in personal conduct that substantially impaired the fulfillment of his institutional responsibilities; and interfered with the normal operations of the university. The letter declared Bloomberg’s decision to fire Pesta.

Pesta was officially fired on March 4, 2022, two and a half years after his article was published.

{snip}

“It’s obvious I am unemployable in academics now,” Pesta told The Chronicle in an email. “I’d rather not share my current employment status, but it’s been tough.” He said he is suing Cleveland State over his termination, and called both the NIH and CSU investigations “kangaroo courts.”

https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2022/11/07/will-affirmative-action-debates-end-legacy-admissions,Will affirmative action debates end legacy admissions?,"When the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on affirmative action last week, affirmative action was not the only controversial admissions practice to come up. Justices on both sides of the main debate also discussed legacy admissions, the practice of giving a preference to the children of alumni.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said, “A university can take into account and value all of the other background and personal characteristics of other applicants, but they can’t value race.” She said she worried “that that seems to me to have the potential of causing more of an equal protection problem than it’s actually solving.”

She offered a hypothetical example involving two applicants to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. (Jackson recused herself from the Harvard University case.)

“The first applicant says, ‘I’m from North Carolina. My family has been in this area for generations, since before the Civil War, and I would like you to know that I will be the fifth generation to graduate from the University of North Carolina. I now have that opportunity to do that, and given my family background, it’s important to me that I get to attend this university. I want to honor my family’s legacy by going to this school.’”

She continued, “The second applicant says, ‘I’m from North Carolina, my family’s been in this area for generations, since before the Civil War, but they were slaves and never had a chance to attend this venerable institution. As an African American, I now have that opportunity, and given my family—family background, it’s important to me to attend this university. I want to honor my family legacy by going to this school.’”

Jackson told a lawyer for Students for Fair Admissions, which sued UNC and Harvard over affirmative action, that “as I understand your no-race-conscious admissions rule, these two applicants would have a dramatically different opportunity to tell their family stories and to have them count. The first applicant would be able to have his family background considered and valued by the institution as part of its consideration of whether or not to admit him, while the second one wouldn’t be able to because his story is in many ways bound up with his race and with the race of his ancestors.”

Her argument was essentially that legacy preferences, at least those that extend several generations, overwhelmingly favor white applicants.

Apparently agreeing with her (not on affirmative action, but on legacy admissions) was Justice Neil M. Gorsuch.

He asked, during the same arguments, about another hypothetical.

”I’d like to ask you just a hypothetical about narrow tailoring, because we’re in strict scrutiny land here, and the university has to demonstrate it’s narrowly tailored, race is narrowly tailored. And diversity is the rationale you’ve asserted before us,” Gorsuch said. “Universities also have all kinds of other plus factors they use, like for legacies of alumni, for donors’ children, for squash players. We learned there are plus factors because [institutions] need those, too. And I guess I’m wondering, suppose a university, a wealthy university, could eliminate those preferences, which tend to favor the children of wealthy white parents and achieve diversity without race-consciousness. Would strict scrutiny require it to do so?”

When the justices were discussing the Harvard case, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh returned to the issue with Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar, whose job is to represent the U.S. government.

Kavanaugh asked her, “So you’re saying an adequate race-neutral alternative, it would be permissible for the court to say that you have to eliminate things like legacy, children of donors, if you could obtain a sufficient … meet its diversity goals, was your word, by doing so and doing race-neutral admissions. Do I have that correct?”

She answered, “Yes, that’s exactly right, Justice Kavanaugh.”

What Will Happen?

James Murphy, a senior policy analyst at Education Reform Now, was watching the court session with great interest. He wrote a recent report that was sharply critical of legacy admissions.

“Legacy preferences provide a birthright advantage to the children of alumni in the college admissions process,” the report said. “They represent a textbook example of systemic racism, since most beneficiaries of legacy preferences are white, while students of color and students from low- and middle-income households are much more likely to be the first in their families to go to college. After a century of use, eliminating legacy preferences is long overdue, but it will be absolutely necessary for them to end should the Supreme Court bar the consideration of race in admissions, as it is expected to do.”

The colleges that continue legacy preferences tend to be on the East Coast. While most colleges that offer legacy preferences are private, the report noted that 80 percent of Virginia’s public colleges do so. Many of the colleges that offer legacy admissions are also among the colleges where a ban of affirmative action would have the most impact.

Murphy doesn’t expect the Supreme Court will rule on the issue, although “we could see a concurring opinion from Gorsuch pushing for the elimination of legacy preferences.”

But Murphy added, “At the same time, I don’t know how any college president or Board of Trustees member can possibly preserve legacy preferences if the court tells colleges they can no longer consider the race of an applicant. Shame alone will make it necessary to drop legacy preferences.”

Terry Hartle, senior vice president for government relations and public affairs of the American Council on Education, which filed a brief in the case defending affirmative action, said he didn’t read too much into the justices’ comments on legacy admissions. “Legacy preferences have been around for a long time—so are the arguments in favor and the arguments against,” he said.

Christoph Baker, a fourth-year medical student at Tufts University, and founder of a Tufts group opposed to legacy admissions, said that he’s noticed “that the narrative around legacy admissions is taking on more of a socioeconomic focus instead of a racial focus.” He said, “We have to remember that legacy preferences were initially begun with the purpose of excluding Jews and other recent European arrivals. While legacy admissions today clearly still discriminate against people of color and recent immigrants, it appears to be drawing the ire of the justices mostly because of its divergent socioeconomic effects.”

Added Baker, “My belief is that this focus on legacy through a socioeconomic lens is happening rather organically since affirmative action is being viewed mainly through the lens of race.” He said this was “largely” a positive development “because anger at socioeconomic equality bridges the liberal-conservative gap. While universities have certainly done an incredible job at resisting pressure, mounting evidence will make it harder for them to justify to the public and themselves that legacy admissions are a necessary trade-off.”

Some (past) defenders of legacy preferences are changing their views. Robert J. Massa, principal and co-founder of Enrollment Intelligence Now, said, “I have a difficult time seeing how its elimination will systemically improve access, as the Yale legacy now rejected from Yale is instead admitted to Duke. That said, because it will be increasingly difficult to justify legacy admission at the 70 or so most selective institutions in the country, we are likely to see its elimination as standard practice systemwide.”

The Council for Advancement and Support of Education issued a statement from Sue Cunningham, its president and CEO. She noted that CASE supported ACE’s brief in the case.

As to legacy admissions, she said, “We continue to firmly believe that higher education institutions are best positioned to determine the criteria that will help them build a diverse admissions class with an appropriate range of talent, background and interests.”",Q4

Roger Waters: Israel is trying to create an intifada ‘so they can just kill them all’

Read on for article

Roger Waters, the former Pink Floyd frontman also known for his vocal criticism of Israel that crosses the line into anti-Semitism, claims in an interview with popular podcaster Joe Rogan that the Jewish state is attempting to manufacture a new intifada with the ultimate goal of killing as many Palestinians as possible.

“The Israelis seem now to have a policy of murdering so many of them, that they are absolutely trying to create another intifada, so they can make it an armed conflict where they’re a thousand times, 10,000 times more powerful than the Palestinian people…so they can just kill them all,” Waters, an outspoken supporter of the BDS Movement, said on The Joe Rogan Experience.

Waters also called the Gaza Strip-ruling terrorist organization Hamas the “democratically elected government of Gaza,” acknowledging the existence of an “armed wing” of Hamas yet justifying the Palestinians’ “absolute legal and moral right to resist the occupation” and then minimizing the impact of their rocket attacks against Israel. The rockets “almost never do any damage because they’re very ineffectual,” he said.

Rogan, meanwhile, lamented that Palestinians “through no fault of their own, just happened to be born Palestinian and [have] been stuck in this apartheid state,” referring to Israel.

In July, when describing the events that led to the establishment of the modern State of Israel, Waters said, “It’s about a bunch of, you know, Europeans back in the middle of the 19th century deciding that they were going to take over this piece of land, and kick out anybody that lived there and take it over for themselves and for their own little cabal.”

Ahead of Waters’ tour of Florida in August, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) penned an op-ed that called out the musician’s years of “unjustified hatred” for Israel and anti-Semitism.

“When you tell interviewers that an ‘Israel lobby’ is responsible for [former Labour Party leader] Jeremy Corbyn’s electoral loss in Britain, that there is a Zionist conspiracy to block criticism of Israel in America’s news and music industry, and that believing the Jews are God’s chosen people is the same as saying Arab lives ‘are worthless,’ you can’t be surprised that people take you for an anti-Semite,” Rubio wrote for The Floridian.",Q4

Replacing fighter squadrons on Okinawa with rotational forces will have negative impacts that will be hard for the Air Force to remedy, according to a former deputy commander of the U.S. Pacific Command.

Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan Leaf in a Nov. 16 interview questioned the two-year phased withdrawal of two squadrons of F-15 Eagle fighters from Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, that began Nov. 1. Alaska-based F-22 Raptors began a rotation at the base on Nov. 4.

A former F-15 pilot himself on Okinawa from 1981 to 1985, Leaf was also deputy commander from 2005 to 2008 of U.S. Pacific Command, now called Indo-Pacific Command.

“I would maintain a permanent air superiority fighter presence in Okinawa if the decision were up to me,” he said, noting the island’s proximity to Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula.

Basing forces on Okinawa has involved difficult negotiations with the prefectural and Japanese governments, Leaf said.

“Removing the F-15s is going to make it very difficult to negotiate a permanent basing of any other planes on Okinawa,” the veteran of combat in Iraq and Kosovo told Stars and Stripes by phone.

“Once they’re gone on a permanent basis, they’re gone,” he said of the fighter squadrons at Kadena. “So permanently basing fighters on Okinawa, for whatever reason we might want to do it, is going to be difficult.”

Kadena’s 18th Wing on Tuesday mobilized 23 F-15C Eagles, eight F-22A Raptors, a trio of HH-60 Pave Hawks, a KC-135 Stratotanker, reconnaissance and command-and-control aircraft in its first large-scale show of force since the F-15s’ phase out began.

Air Force commanders in Japan rely on a fabric of capabilities that includes permanently based and rotational force, Leaf said.

“One thing you do with permanently based forces is build relationships with partners like the Japan Air Self-Defense Force,” he said. “That’s much more difficult to do on a rotational basis.”

The Air Force has had a good mix of permanently based and rotational aircraft in Japan that has served it well for decades, Leaf said.

The departure of the F-15s is “a loss of permanently-based capability and relationship building with Japan … and probably the loss of the ability to do that ever again,” he said.

It’s incorrect, Leaf said, to suggest that bases on Okinawa aren’t survivable in a conflict with China, as claimed by Steve Ganyard, a former deputy assistant secretary of State, in a Nov. 11 email to Stars and Stripes.

“To some degree Okinawa can be defended,” Leaf said. “It needs to be a priority, and it is. There has been significant investment by the U.S. and Japan in the defense of Okinawa and other Japanese territory.”

A pair of Japanese destroyers shot down targets using a new type of defensive missile off Hawaii earlier this month, according to the U.S. Missile Defense Agency.

Rotational forces on the island bear the same risk as permanently stationed aircraft, Leaf said.

“Just because they’re rotational doesn’t give them some sort of cloaking device or make it easy to teleport them to some other location in the Indo-Pacific,” he said.

The F-15 is still a capable plane but very old, Leaf said.

“Of all the fourth-generation aircraft, only one has a 104-0 record in aerial combat,” he said. “I would not [mess] with an F-15 if I was a Chinese pilot.”

But the Air Force has not invested enough to replace the F-15, Leaf said. For example, the service had requested hundreds of F-22s but only bought 183, he said.

“We knew 20 years ago that wasn’t enough,” he said.

Whatever the rationale for the removal of the F-15s from Okinawa, the Chinese will see it as a withdrawal, Leaf said.

“It is a lack of commitment in their minds,” he said. “In terms of deterrence it’s a net negative. That element can’t be undone by saying we are going to rotate, or the planes are more capable.”

Leaf isn’t alone in his criticism of the move. Prominent Republican lawmakers sent a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Nov. 1, saying they feared a “tangible reduction in American forward combat power.”

There should be a permanent Air Force fighter presence on Okinawa but the F-15s are too old and need to be shelved, according to Riki Ellison, founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, which lobbies for missile defense, deployment and development.

“We have no choice but to place F-22s and F-35s in rotation until we get a new set of planes to place there,” he said in an email Tuesday. “We have to play with what we got until we get more.”

However, a move to rotational units on Okinawa “in concert with upgraded Japanese tactical air assets may not be a diplomatically problematic move,” Paul Buchanan, a U.S. security expert based in New Zealand, said by email Tuesday.

The move reflects the fact that Japan is assuming a more robust military posture, to include proposed changes in its pacifist constitution, he said.

“The loss of F-15s can be compensated by Japanese forces as well as whatever the US brings in as a stop gap,” he said. “Tactical airpower numbers will remain robust no matter what actually happens.”",Q4

https://www.dawn.com/news/1728286/govt-doubles-seats-for-students-of-tribal-districts-in-medical-colleges,Govt doubles seats for students of tribal districts in medical colleges,"PESHAWAR: The government has doubled the number of seats allocated in medical and dental colleges for the students of tribal districts for the academic session 2022-23.

The decision, taken by Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC), has been conveyed to the provincial health department and Khyber Medical University (KMU), the admitting varsity in the province.

Sources told this scribe that PMC had reduced seats in medical colleges for the students of newly-merged districts which created unrest among them. They said that the allocation of seats in different public sector medical and dental institutes had been reduced to 136 from 290 for former Fata.

They said that the number of quota-based seats for Balochistan had also been decreased to 29 from 113. PMC has informed the vice-chancellor of KMU, Prof Ziaul Haq, about the number of eats in November of the current year.

Additional seats distributed among 14 medical and dental colleges in KP

The government had increased the number of seats to 290 in academic year 2021-22 while seats for Balochistan were enhanced from 29 to 113 in public sector medical and dental colleges of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The decision to enhance seats had been made through Federal Cabinet Division Islamabad in a meeting held on March 2, 2017 with the then prime minister in the chair. The meeting decided that the quota for students of tribal areas in education and health institutions in all provinces should be doubled and retained for 10 year after its merger with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

In compliance with the same decision and letters by Higher Education Commission and Pakistan Medical Commission, the KMU implemented the directives for two years and double seats were allocated to the students in 2021 and 2022.

However, official sources said that reduction in seats by PMC for that academic session caused unrest among the students, who were demanding admission as per 2021 and 2022 policy.

The candidates and their parents started agitation and protest against the government as they were demanding increase in the number of seats. However, neither KMU nor the provincial government had the authority to increase or decrease the number of seats in any medical and dental college of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

It was the prerogative of PMC to allocate seats in any medical and dental college of Pakistan and KMU, the admitting university, would fill only the allocated number of seats, sources said.

PMC clarified that it would be one-time increase in the number of seats as it was made provisionally on the requests of the provinces and in the best interests of the students. In future, the colleges wanting to raise number of seats should make arrangements for mandatory inspections by PMC to stand eligible for the increase, it said. It added that increase in seats would be linked with inspections.

Sources said that PMC had been arguing that it would deteriorate the standard of medical education if it kept admitting more students in colleges with the present infrastructure that was meant for less number of students. They said that medical and dental colleges were being allowed specific number of seats after inspection and it was not a good practice to accommodate more students than the number permitted by PMC.

Prof Ziaul Haq told Dawn that not a single candidate could be enrolled into PMC’s portal over and above the allocated number of seats. He said that KMU was required to induct students on the seats notified by PMC.

He said that a final meeting of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and PMC recently decided to reinstate the quota for students of tribal districts. He said that the number of seats for Balochistan’s tribal areas was also doubled.

“The increased seats have been distributed among the 14 public medical and dental colleges in the province,” said Prof Zia.

https://statenews.com/article/2022/11/msu-food-critics-the-good-the-bad-and-the-devious,"Behind the MSU Food Critics: The good, the bad and the devious","You might have passed one of them in the hallway, or spotted one taking a sneaky photo of their meal in a campus dining hall. You might even have met them without knowing. They walk among us. They’re a voice of the people, an anonymous mouthpiece for students' strong opinions of East Lansing's eats.

In fall of 2021, six friends realized they were talking quite a bit about the food served on campus. One joked they should document and review their experiences of the dining halls. Another stepped up and created an Instagram account, bringing the idea to life. Their first post was a review of the MSU Union’s vegetarian chicken tenders.

“The vegetarian chicken strips are hyper realistic and I feel as tho I am in Ready Player One,” the post read. “However, when you eat more than two some fries I feel like I am being choked by Ronald McDonald.”

Almost exactly a year later, @MSUFoodCritics has almost 300 posts, and their MSU-specific memes and creative descriptions of food have garnered them over 1,600 followers.

Throughout all of this, the six friends have remained completely anonymous as they administrate the account.

“We're really good friends, so it's really easy to joke with each other,” Admin One said. “I think a lot of our really good posts, we're riffing off each other.”

Admin Two said they tried to be analytical at first, but humor won over after one admin posted a photo of a grilled cheese from Brody Hall with the caption, “This grilled cheese tastes like grilled a--.”

From then on, the group embraced their comedic tone as they continued to post.

Their follower count grew quickly, especially after a Feb. 26 collaboration with @MSUAffirmations, another MSU-specific Instagram account that posts encouraging statements you might find the average Spartan convincing themselves under their breath – like “I will get through midterms week.”

“We ate at Beaumont Tower, it was really fun,” Admin Three said. “We did a conjoined Instagram post and a lot of their followers followed us, and they have a lot of followers.”

By this time, the critics had expanded their range, reviewing restaurants around East Lansing and Okemos. They were also regularly receiving 100-200 likes on their reviews, which weren’t always negative. Admins approved of Case Hall’s sundae bar, Snyder-Phillips’ pierogies, Hubbard’s mozzarella sticks, MSU’s Dec. 7 student appreciation meal, Brody’s tempura chicken and much more.

Admin Two recalls having a meal so good, she remembered the specific date she ate it.

“On January 17, 2022 they had chicken parm,” Admin Two said. “I remember eating it and being like ‘This. I want more of this.’ It’s not just eating to survive, it’s eating it because it’s good. It’s still the best thing I’ve ever eaten in the dining hall, and I don’t think it can be topped.”

On Nov. 11, 2021, Admin One gave a favorable review to the Brody Hall grilled cheese, the same sandwich the account had slammed earlier that month. This contrast was something the admins enjoyed – they often comment on each other’s reviews using the food critics account, creating the appearance of one admin with six different personalities.

“It would just be the account commenting on its own post, so it looked like we were a little insane,” Admin One said. “That's something we joke about … and play into the craziness of six people running one Instagram account, it can get sometimes chaotic, which is kind of fun.”

Much of the critics’ humor comes from their creative use of adjectives, like the word “devious,” which Admin One said can be used for something very bad or very good. The word is such a signature that they're concerned they reveal themselves by using it out loud on campus.

“It’s devious how much we use the word,” Admin One said.

One post from Oct. 13 described the Snyder-Phillips dining hall as a “gladiator pit,” where on any given day one could run into an old elementary school classmate, a high school nemesis or a professor whose class you skipped that afternoon.

A Sept. 8 review describes Landon Hall’s apple cheese biscuit as “a slippery little bastard” and quotes a line from the Jurassic Park movie: “Your (chefs at Landon) were so preoccupied with whether they could that they didn’t stop to think if they should.”

All admins have access to the login, but the group enjoys bouncing ideas off each other and going out to eat together. They identified Admin Three as the funniest of the group and the driving force behind the distinct, ridiculing and pop-culture referencing tone their reviews have adopted.

Admin Three said they felt lucky all of their friends had the same sense of humor.

This summer, the critics became the admins of another successful MSU-specific social media account, Fake People @ Michigan State, which previously went viral for its TikTok videos of random people around campus paired with captions that imagined a backstory for them. The food critics took over this account after its previous owner graduated from MSU.

“TikTok’s a much larger audience, our food account is more niche,” Admin Four said. “The TikTok has to be a little less like that.”

The food critics have had their fair share of accidental reveals – Admin Four once accidentally followed fellow club members from the critic account by accident and had to confess. Admin Two’s roommate recognized a photo they posted in their room. Admin One was approached by an acquaintance she hadn’t seen since high school, asking them if they were behind the account.

Admin Four said they want to further expand their reviews outside of campus next year, when all six admins will be living off campus. Admin Two said they may start reviewing local bars when most of their team comes of age.

And when the admins are no longer living on campus, will MSU’s foremost campus food critic forever move past the dining hall walls? Will they quit, leaving students to wonder if the meal they are about to dig into is devious, tasty or maybe a little bit of both?

Not exactly.

“We’ll still eat there,” Admin Three said.

“It’s gonna change slightly, living off campus,” Admin Two said, “but I think we all plan to do it until we graduate. It doesn’t look like it’s going to get any less fun.”

Klancnik Jr.



Nicole Eustace

Nicole Eustace is a historian who is ""always interested in human beings in their messy multi-dimensionality,"" she told Seven Days by email. ""I think the greatest respect I can pay to my historical subjects is to engage with them as full people, and that means neither vilifying nor canonizing them but rather recognizing their humanity in all its complexity.""

Eustace's third and most recent book, Covered With Night: A Story of Murder and Indigenous Justice in Early America, is a winner of the 2022 Pulitzer Prize in history and was a finalist for the 2021 National Book Award. She will read at the Brattleboro Literary Festival on Saturday, October 15.

At New York University, where she is a professor of history, Eustace specializes in 18th-century North America, gender, culture, politics and the history of emotion — a growing field that combines historical analysis with psychology and the study of individual and mass behavior, power relations, and community formation.

She also researches and teaches the history of laws, which she called ""a culture's best attempts to codify the norms of conduct through which the members of society are to be governed."" In Eustace's view, laws reveal ""ideas, attitudes and values and are a great starting place to understand the spirit of a people.""

Covered With Night brings to the fore an obscure incident from 1722 and its repercussions, which Eustace believes are still felt today.

A native Seneca hunter named Sawantaeny was killed in a drunken argument with two brothers, the white traders John and Edmund Cartlidge. Colonial officials in Pennsylvania feared that the murder might set off a war with the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) federation, whose power at that time rivaled or exceeded the influence and military might of the English to their south and the French to their north. Therefore, the Cartlidge brothers were imprisoned, with the expectation that they'd be executed to appease their victim's people.

But the Indigenous people in the region took a completely different approach to justice in the case, as Eustace learned by poring over detailed contemporary accounts, including newspaper articles, minutes of government hearings, letters, diaries and records of treaty negotiations.

She tells the story of three intermediaries, speaking three different languages, who effectively coordinated a diplomatic breakthrough: the Iroquoian speaker Satcheechoe; the Susquehannock speaker Taquatarensaly, also known as Captain Civility; and Alice Kirk, an Anglo woman who could translate the Native language Delaware into English. Their method was an early example of what today we'd call ""restorative justice,"" a technique that replaces punishment with an apology, reparations and reconciliation.

The hundreds of citations in the back of Covered With Night confirm the breadth and depth of Eustace's investigative skills, but immersive scholarship alone can't account for the vigor and vividness of her storytelling. Eustace is a marvelous chronicler, and her book has the narrative power of a novel.

In an email exchange with Seven Days, Eustace shared how she discovered the 1722 incident and offered observations on the differences between European and Indigenous views of justice and the lasting significance of 18th-century treaties.

Covered With Night: A Story of Murder and Indigenous Justice in Early America by Nicole Eustace, Liveright, 464 pages. $20.

NICOLE EUSTACE: I set out to investigate how Enlightenment ideas about civilization and savagery impacted cross-cultural relationships between Anglo-American settler colonists in Pennsylvania and the Indigenous peoples of the Susquehanna River Valley. I began reading the Minutes of the Provincial Council of Pennsylvania, knowing they contained extensive records of what were then called ""Indian treaties,"" and that these could convey a great deal of information about Native perspectives on the encounter with Europeans. I discovered that the year 1718 marked a major turning point in Pennsylvania's criminal law codes, which were made much more severe after colony founder William Penn's death that year. I then stumbled on a 1722 murder case that tested those laws. Colonial fur traders brutally attacked a Seneca hunter, but Native people sought reconciliation rather than revenge. The detailed notes of their arguments drew me in, and I knew I'd lucked into a story that deserved to be told.

SD: Where did you first encounter the Susquehannock interpreter and diplomat Taquatarensaly, known as Captain Civility?

NE: The Native man known as Captain Civility took a central role in trying to explain Indigenous principles of justice to incredulous and uncomprehending settler colonists. He tutored colonists on Indigenous methods of conflict resolution, showing them that even a murder crisis could provide an occasion to strengthen ties of community.

Because I was interested from the start in thinking critically about settler colonists' claims to so-called civilization, coming across an Indigenous man called Captain Civility seemed extraordinarily significant. I found in my research that this was an Indigenous job title used by generations of Susquehannock diplomats tasked with bridging divides between different Native nations, tying disparate peoples together in civil society. Taquatarensaly's name incorporates the Susquehannock word ""attaqua,"" meaning ""shoes,"" which conveyed his role of walking between peoples, joining them in community.

SD: Which writers — historians and literary artists — have been your models for creating prose that's so engaging, both informative and exciting?

NE: I've long admired the historical method known as microhistory — small stories with big implications — first introduced by the historian Natalie Zemon Davis. Building on the research of my fellow scholars, especially Indigenous historians such as Alyssa Mt. Pleasant, Jean O'Brien, Michael Witgen and others whose work informed and enriched my analysis, I wanted to experiment with using techniques of creative nonfiction. The phenomenal writing of Hilary Mantel, an incomparable novelist with an intense commitment to history, helped me see the drama in history in a new way.

SD: You call the Great Treaty of 1722, which resolved the murder crisis, ""the oldest continuously recognized Indigenous treaty in Anglo-American law."" What is the lasting significance of those treaties negotiated and ratified between colonial and then federal governments and tribal nations?

NE: Treaties set out tribal rights of Native nations that remain key elements of their legal claims to national sovereignty and land tenure to this day. They are an essential aspect of Indigenous rights. They are also a repository of Native culture, intellectual history and political philosophy, containing intricate speeches delivered by Native speakers on the basis of community consensus. In Covered With Night I draw on treaty council records as a primary source for 18th-century Indigenous history and for Indigenous theories of justice specifically.

SD: In the story you tell, Native negotiators demonstrate tremendous ambassadorial skill, subtle philosophical reasoning and sophisticated political understanding. Yet you never idealize the Haudenosaunee people nor villainize their Anglo-American counterparts.

NE: As a historian, I am not interested in straw men or cardboard cutouts of characters. No matter who or what I'm writing about, I'm always interested in human beings in all their messy multi-dimensionality. Particularly in portrayals of Native people, polarizing stereotypes of cruelty versus nobility have been pernicious for centuries, to the point that Indigenous lives and experiences have been flattened almost beyond recognition. So, I think there's an extra ethical responsibility to try to portray Native people in three dimensions.

SD: The example of a historical ""truth and reconciliation"" process described by Covered With Night must be very relevant to those now questioning our reliance on incarceration and punishment, including the death penalty. Have you heard from readers who find this story especially meaningful in showing an alternative to punitive justice?

NE: Yes, I have heard from Native activists and advocates of criminal justice reform, as well as people working on racial reconciliation projects at every level, from local to national. This response has been absolutely the most rewarding aspect of writing the book. History can sometimes seem abstract; to know that my work is helping to inspire and support those taking active roles in progressive causes has made me feel that all the hours spent alone at the keyboard can have an impact out in the world.",Q4
https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2022/11/02/robber-is-sentenced-to-10-years-in-prison/,Robber Is Sentenced To 10 Years In Prison,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. – A Charlotte man who robbed three businesses was sentenced to 120 months in prison today, announced Dena J. King, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina. In addition to the prison term imposed, U.S. District Judge Kenneth D. Bell also ordered John Paul Gaddy, 35, to serve three years of supervised release after he is released from prison.

Michael C. Scherck, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Charlotte Division, Chief Bence Hoyle of the Huntersville Police Department, and Chief Josh Watson of the Troutman Police Department join U.S. Attorney King in making today’s announcement.

According to court documents and today’s sentencing hearing, between March and April 2021, Gaddy used a BB gun to rob three businesses. On March 12, 2021, Gaddy robbed the Lucia Food Mart located at 104 Killian Road in Stanley, North Carolina, followed by another robbery on April 25, 2021, of the Fast Phil’s convenience store located at 502 Gilead Road in Huntersville, North Carolina. Court records show that, during the second robbery, Gaddy pointed a BB gun at the clerk, giving her the impression that it was real gun, ordered the clerk to back up, and then grabbed cash from the register. The third robbery occurred three days later, on April 28, 2021. According to court records, Gaddy entered a Dollar Tree store located at 611 N. Main St. in Troutman, North Carolina. As with the previous robbery, Gaddy pointed the BB gun at the clerk, who thought it was a real gun, and said, “If you don’t put all of your money in the bag, I’m going to kill you.” As the clerk attempted to escape, Gaddy grabbed the entire cash register drawer and left the store.

On May 4, 2021, a Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD) officer conducted a traffic stop of a vehicle in which Gaddy was the passenger. Over the course of the traffic stop, Gaddy resisted arrest and fought with CMPD officers before he was detained.

On June 7, 2022, Gaddy pleaded guilty to Hobbs Act robbery. He is currently in federal custody and will be transferred to the custody of the federal Bureau of Prison upon designation of a federal facility.

In making today’s announcement, U.S. Attorney King commended the FBI, the Huntersville Police Department, and the Troutman Police Department for their investigation of the case, and thanked CMPD for their invaluable assistance.

Assistant U.S. Attorney David Kelly of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Charlotte prosecuted the case.",Q4
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/louisiana-amendment-one-seeks-prevent-noncitizen-voting,Louisiana Amendment 1 seeks to prevent noncitizen voting,"A joint resolution passed by both houses of Louisiana state government is up for vote in a December 10th statewide special election.

If it passes, Amendment 1 will codify in the Louisiana constitution that only American citizens can vote in any level of election statewide.

While noncitizens cannot vote in federal elections since 1996's Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, election laws regarding noncitizens at state and local levels are left for those jurisdictions to decide.

Over the past 26 years, progressive states and localities have pushed at those boundaries laid in the IIRIA.

COTTON PLANS TO BLOCK DC FROM ALLOWING ILLEGAL ALIENS TO VOTE: 'INSANE POLICY'

Municipalities like Montpelier, Vermont have allowed noncitizens to vote in local elections like school board through a technicality in the Green Mountain State's constitution.

Most recently, the Washington, D.C., city council proposed similar legislation permitting noncitizen voting for illegal aliens who reside in-district for at least 30 days.

There are the typical criticisms from the right, with Senator Cruz proposing to withdraw federal funding from D.C. government. But opposition is also coming from an unlikely source: The Washington Post Editorial Board.

Louisiana Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin defended citizen-only voting in a statement to Fox News Digital: ""This amendment is about common sense. Democrats and Republicans in the Louisiana Legislature, as well as the Washington Post Editorial Board, agree: noncitizen voting is antithetical to who we are as a republic.""

In order to qualify for the December 10th ballot, the amendment passed with a nearly unanimous vote in the Louisiana state Senate and another wide margin in the state House.

Secretary of State Ardoin testified on behalf of the amendment in both the Louisiana House and Senate last year ahead of the legislators' vote.

CRUZ FIGHTS DC PUSH TO LET ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS VOTE WITH BILL TO WITHHOLD FEDERAL FUNDING

As the law currently stands in the Pelican State, only American citizens can register as voters and vote in any election at state or local levels.

However, the same kind of loophole which is present in the Vermont constitution, that municipalities like Montpelier used to its advantage for noncitizen voting, is also present in the Louisiana constitution.

Amendment 1 closes this loophole in the Louisiana constitution if the majority votes yes on December 10.

Secretary of State Ardoin proposed a paper component to Louisiana elections for auditing purposes alongside state legislators like Sharon Hewitt late last year in the hopes to promote election integrity.

Joel Watson, Deputy of Outreach Services for Secretary Ardoin, shared in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital that he believes, ""Louisiana is a leader in elections because we have a top-down system, which means that the state controls elections while working with local partners in clerks of court and registrars of voters. We feel like that's a better system because the issues that people are concerned about in places like Arizona and in other states are related to the issues or failures at the county level. The top-down system is mandated in Louisiana law.""

Kyle Ardoin was nominated by his fellow secretaries of state to chair the non-partisan National Association of Secretaries of State or NASS in 2021 and completed his term this year.

U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher found that Michael Fisher, 47, was involved in what federal prosecutors described as a large-scale drug trafficking organization in 2019 and 2020, possessing or distributing approximately 120 kilograms of cocaine, 6.5 kilograms of fentanyl and 50 kilograms of marijuana. The finding at sentencing settled a dispute between lawyers over how much of the drugs were attributable to Fisher.

In August 2020, Fisher was arrested in Nevada after federal and state investigators surveilled him and Dwight Antonio Pitts, 47, of Hanover, listening to the two discuss drug transactions over the phone via a wiretap. Investigators later found that the men dropped off packages of drugs at post offices in California, bound for multiple locations in Maryland, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

Officers searched one Las Vegas residence and six Maryland locations they said were associated with Pitts and Fisher in August 2020, finding nine firearms at locations associated with Fisher and six firearms at locations associated with Pitts. Investigators seized 25 kilograms of cocaine, 6.5 kilograms of fentanyl and about 50 kilograms of marijuana, along with $1.5 million in cash.

Federal prosecutors said in a sentencing memorandum that Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed Fisher’s name is actually Mark Wilson. However, prosecutors continued to refer to him as Michael Fisher.

“He was born in Jamaica and was previously deported from the United States in 2003,” prosecutors said. “The defendant’s use of a false name is troubling, especially given the number of fake identification documents that were recovered from the defendant and his residence.”

Fisher pleaded guilty to drug distribution and possession charges last year, but later attempted to withdraw his plea, stating his attorney only provided him with a 30-page summary of thousands of pages of discovery material. Gallagher ruled against that request. Pitts pleaded guilty to drug charges and was sentenced to 15 years of incarceration in March.

Defense attorney Richard Bardos, who represented Fisher, submitted several letters from Fisher’s acquaintances describing him as a hardworking family man, willing to lend a helping hand at any time.

“I honestly don’t think I would have gotten in or through school without him,” wrote Sean Beswick, who said he has known Fisher for more than 30 years. He noted he had been incarcerated himself. “It was Michael encouraging me to do was right [sic] leave my past mistakes behind me and go back to school get a job to make myself a productive person in society.”

Bardos also asked the judge for leniency, writing in a sentencing memorandum that Fisher’s incarceration at the Chesapeake Detention Facility in Baltimore over the past two years has been “far more punishing and severe than if he had spent the equivalent time” at a federal prison. He noted that Fisher has contacted COVID-19 three times at the facility due to what he claimed were “unsanitary conditions.”

Federal prosecutors noted in a sentencing memorandum that Fisher had been convicted of a marijuana possession with intent to distribute charge in Anne Arundel County in 2016, saying the conduct “gave rise” to his conviction in the most recent case.

“This time, the defendant ramped up his illegal activity significantly and distributed substantially more narcotics and possessed many more firearms than he had in the past,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Anatoly Smolkin wrote.

Gallagher sentenced Fisher to 17 years and ordered him to forfeit over $61,000 seized from a Laurel residence associated with him, as well as eight firearms.",Q4

If disgraced Hollywood movie mogul Harvey Weinstein issued a statement condemning Bill Cosby’s alleged abuse of women, would you take it seriously?

I sure hope not. Weinstein is on trial in Los Angeles for alleged rapes after being convicted in 2020 of similar charges in New York. One sexual predator condemning another doesn’t really mean much.

I had a similar reaction Tuesday, when the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) condemned blatantly antisemitic comments by rap star Kanye West.

West promised to “go death con 3 on Jewish people,” in a social media post earlier this month. He followed that up by making statements about Jewish control of the media and other antisemitic conspiracies

“Kanye West’s antisemitic statements have contributed to the already alarming rise in antisemitism that we are seeing in our society and must not be tolerated,” CAIR’s Los Angeles chapter director Hussam Ayloush said in the statement.

But CAIR manages to tolerate it when the antisemitism involves Israel and Jews who support it.

In June, a “mapping project” by a group supporting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel was roundly condemned as dangerous antisemitism that could put people at risk. The map showed the exact locations for dozens of Jewish organizations and others who support Israel’s existence.

It was a case of “outright antisemitic bigotry, conspiracy theories and implicit invitations to violence,” wrote Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank. But when he called CAIR for comment, he was told it “is not an issue we’re dealing with at this time.”

“Why not?” Milbank wondered.

I explained why in detail. There’s something in CAIR’s DNA – it was born out of a Muslim Brotherhood-controlled Hamas-support network in the United States – that puts its opposition to Israel’s existence above everything else. Nihad Awad, CAIR’s co-founder and the only executive director in its 28-year history, was listed along with two other founding officials, in a roster of network members.

Last month, CAIR defended U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib after she told an anti-Israel group that people “cannot claim to hold progressive values, yet back Israel’s apartheid government.” The comment drew immediate rebuke from many of Tlaib’s fellow Democrats. And it came after Tlaib said she wants a “one-state solution” to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, which essentially results in the elimination of the world’s only Jewish state.

Her critics were the bigots, CAIR said in a statement: “The claim that she said something anti-Semitic is a blatant and dangerous lie.” The response “points to the need for Democrats in Congress to address the issue of Islamophobia within their own ranks.”

Repeat Offenders

And CAIR stood by San Francisco chapter director Zahra Billoo after she similarly warned an audience last year that “polite Zionists” were “enemies” behind “a well-funded conspiracy” to push “Islamophobia … to marginalize us, to imprison us, to deport us, to silence us.” She did nothing wrong, CAIR said. Again, it accused her critics of being the real haters.

It said that Billoo was the target of an “online smear campaign” by “Islamophobic, anti-Palestinian groups that use false allegations of anti-Semitism in a cynical attempt to silence American Muslims who speak up for Palestinian human rights.” Saying she “discouraged Muslims from working with Jewish groups at-large” was a lie.

But here is what she said on video:

“We need to pay attention to the Anti-Defamation League. We need to pay attention to the Jewish Federation. We need to pay attention to the Zionist synagogues. We need to pay attention to the Hillel chapters on our campuses, because just because they’re your friend today doesn’t mean that they have your back when it comes to human rights. So oppose the vehement fascists, but oppose the polite Zionists, too.”

In April, Billoo made it clear that she was, in fact, discouraging Muslims from working with Jewish groups at large.

“If you are pro-Israel and you are working actively to harm our community here and abroad, we don’t want to work with you,” she said. “We have so many other friends and partners to work with, so many other things that we can do. If you’re with the Anti-Defamation League, if you’re with the Jewish Community Relations Council, if you’re with the Jewish Federation, if you’re with any of these pro-Israel organizations, enough is enough.”

With apologies to Jeff Foxworthy, if you see the overwhelming majority of Jewish people as enemies not to be trusted, you might be an antisemite.

But CAIR doesn’t care. Billoo is still on the job and, as far as the public knows, faced no consequences for calling Jews “enemies” trying to harm Muslims.

“Billoo,” the Simon Wiesenthal Center said in January, “is but one of venomous professional Israel and Jew-haters who use non-existent dots to create phony links between Israel and US social crises. They always wrap their bigotry in the mantle of social justice. The goal is demonizing the Jewish state and silencing Israel’s supporters on campus and Capitol Hill.”

Tolerance and Excuses

Since the Wiesenthal Center placed it on a list of the world’s worst anti-Semites, CAIR has intensified a campaign to persuade people it has no problems with Jews.

It has issued at least 11 statements since Sept. 21 condemning antisemitic acts throughout the country. That includes West’s rants, but also the destruction of a mezuzah snatched off an Indiana family’s front door, a swastika scratched into a yard sign for congressional candidate Max Rose in New York, and the distribution of antisemitic flyers in southern California, Arizona, Wyoming, South Carolina, Virginia, Michigan, and North Dakota.

“Those targeting the Jewish community with antisemitic hate must be repudiated by all Americans,” CAIR national spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said in the Wyoming statement. “The mainstreaming of bigotry in any form must never be tolerated or excused.”

As we have shown, CAIR both “tolerates and excuses” antisemitism within its own ranks.

During a 2012 sermon, CAIR Michigan director Dawud Walid asked his audience, “Who are those who incurred the wrath of Allah?” Speaking in Arabic, he answered, “They are the Jews, they are the Jews.” Seven years later, Walid said that Jews “were specifically cursed, meaning Allah’s mercy was withheld from them because they saw the injustice, they saw the anti-social behavior, they saw the lewdness, and they just were complacent. They were cool with it. They didn’t speak out against it. They allowed it to become part of the status quo.”

Walid, like Billoo, still is a prominent CAIR official.

Meanwhile, we could find no CAIR news release in the wake of attacks by Palestinian advocates in the United States last year targeting random Jews. The attacks came during the May 2021 fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

In Los Angeles, diners sitting outside a sushi restaurant were beaten by men from a caravan of Palestinian supporters. In New York, at least five men attacked a Jewish man wearing a yarmulke near Times Square. They “knocked him down, punched, kicked and pepper sprayed him and hit him with crutches, while making anti-Semitic statements,” the New York Police Department said.

When news outlets asked CAIR for comment, it said, “As a civil rights and advocacy organization, we support everyone’s right to free speech, the right to assemble and rally in support of their respective political views.

“However, despite heightened tensions in Palestine and Israel, it is never acceptable for that conflict to spill over into our streets and cities. Violence and intimidation should be condemned, investigated, and if warranted, prosecuted.”

Similarly, Hooper told reporters, “While everyone has the First Amendment right to speak out on any issue they want, any act of hate speech, violence or intimidation, regardless of which side you are on, is inappropriate.”

Jews were beaten because they were Jews. But CAIR could not bring itself to acknowledge that the violence was motivated by antisemitism because it involved Palestinian supporters.

It is clear that CAIR is trying to fool the public. It is quick to issue releases condemning antisemitism by anonymous individuals who dump flyers in a neighborhood, or who get caught defacing a synagogue. But when it comes to conspiracy theories about Jews driving “a well-funded conspiracy … to marginalize us, to imprison us, to deport us, to silence us,” or condemning violence by Palestinian advocates against random Jews, the group is uncharacteristically reserved.

Pointing this out, they’ll likely argue, is Islamophobic.

The PTI has decided to approach the Supreme Court again for the verification of its MNAs' resignations after National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf allegedly delayed the matter on purpose.

The party’s legal team has started preparing for the case as it believes that the speaker was deliberately dragging his feet on the issue.

When the PTI announced that its MNAs would reach the assembly to tender their resignations again, the speaker had adjourned its session indefinitely.

PTI sources said when the party’s MNAs announced that they would appear before the speaker to have their resignations verified, Ashraf left on a leave.

The “delay tactics” being employed by the NA speaker have compelled the PTI to move the top court once more.

In a related development, President Dr Arif Alvi has convened a session of the National Assembly on Thursday (today) under Article 54 (1) of the Constitution.

The PTI MNAs had decided to appear before the NA speaker in person on Thursday to verify their resignations, which have been lying pending with him despite the lapse of several months and repeated requests from the party leadership to accept them.

On April 3, then NA deputy speaker Qasim Suri had rejected a no-confidence motion against then premier Imran Khan, saying that it was backed by a foreign state therefore, it was “unconstitutional” under Article 5 of the Constitution.

He then prorogued the session without the vote on the motion.

However, his ruling was struck down by the Supreme Court on April 7.

On April 13, Suri had accepted the resignations of 123 PTI MNAs before stepping down from his post.

Ashraf, after taking oath of his office later in the same month, had directed the assembly secretariat to deal with the resignations of lawmakers of the PTI afresh and present them before him so that they could be treated as per law.

The ruling of the 22nd speaker of the assembly came amid claims and speculations that some of the PTI lawmakers were now willing to retract and have been conveying messages that their resignations should not be accepted.

He later accepted the resignations of only 11 PTI lawmakers on July 27.

The PTI challenged the move in the Islamabad High Court on August 1.

However, the court dismissed the petition and declared that the acceptance of PTI lawmakers’ resignations by the then-deputy speaker was unconstitutional.

Subsequently, the party moved the apex court, requesting it to set aside the IHC order, terming it “vague, cursory, and against the law”.",Q4

CNN

By Nouran Salahieh and Rob Shackelford, CNN

A massive cross-country storm is producing damaging tornadoes in the South, where a child has died, and punishing blizzard conditions in Colorado and the Plains that have resulted in shuttered interstates and snarled travel.

The storm system moving east across the nation — currently lingering over the central US — is fueling severe weather felt throughout the country, with at least five confirmed tornadoes in Texas and multiple others reported. The storms left a path of destruction across Oklahoma and the Dallas-Fort Worth area Tuesday, flattening homes and injuring at least seven people.

In Louisiana, a child who was missing after a tornado touched down in Keithville Tuesday was found dead, and a search for the young boy’s mother is ongoing, the Caddo Parish Sheriff’s Office said in a Facebook post.

“A young boy was found deceased in a wooded area of Pecan Farms where his home was destroyed,” the sheriff’s office said.

About 100 miles away in the small Union Parish town of Farmerville, Louisiana, at least 20 people were injured after a tornado struck Tuesday night, according to Farmerville Police Detective Cade Nolan.

“It’s the worst damage I’ve seen in 17 years,” Nolan told CNN, describing seeing mobile homes lifted from their axles and frames and in some cases carried a quarter of a mile away.

First responders were still searching for people in the early morning hours Wednesday, Nolan said, adding several people were injured while traveling in cars.

Meanwhile, nearly 10 million people — largely in the north-central US — are under winter weather warnings or advisories, with blowing snow and power outages a key concern. Another 6 million people across the northeast will be under winter storm watches Wednesday.

As the storm continues its trek east, here’s what different regions can expect:

Tornadoes and damaging winds are possible Wednesday over parts of southern Louisiana, southern and central Mississippi, southern Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle.

There is an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms, and a risk of excessive rainfall over the Lower Mississippi Valley and Central Gulf Coast through Thursday.

Heavy snow, rain and freezing rain are expected over the Upper Midwest Wednesday

Freezing rain and sleet are expected to continue across the Plains and then shift into the Upper Midwest through Wednesday, making travel dangerous.

The storm over the Central Plains is expected to move northeast to the Upper Great Lakes, while a sister storm develops over parts of the Mid-Atlantic by Thursday, according to the Weather Prediction Center. Multiple days of heavy snow, strong winds and freezing rain will continue to stir up extreme weather across the north-central US through Thursday evening.

Tornadoes in the South

More than 3 million people across parts of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Arkansas were under tornado watches early Wednesday. The main threats continue to include possible tornadoes, hail and gusts up to 75 mph.

Since Tuesday, there have been multiple tornado and hail reports.

Videos showed downed power lines and destroyed homes in Decatur and Blue Ridge, Texas, as well as Wayne, Oklahoma, after the storm brought severe weather barreling through.

Just outside Dallas, storms left at least five people injured, Grapevine police said. Businesses including a Grapevine mall, a Sam’s Club and a Walmart were damaged, police said.

Another two people were injured, and homes and businesses were damaged, in Wise County Tuesday morning, northwest of Fort Worth, county officials said. One person was hurt when wind overturned their vehicle, and the other — also in a vehicle — was hurt by flying debris, officials said.

In Wayne, Oklahoma, a confirmed EF2 tornado knocked out power and damaged homes, outbuildings and barns early Tuesday, officials said, though no injuries were reported.

In Farmerville, Louisiana, Tiyia Stringfellow told CNN she was inside her apartment when a tornado hit. She was with her boyfriend and two young children and all of them survived without injuries, she said.

“We were in the kitchen closet,” Stringfellow said. “All we heard was whistling and my boyfriend got up to look outside of the window and he (saw) the tornado, the whole house was shaking and I (saw) my roof cave in and the house went dark.”

For Wednesday, parts of southern Louisiana, southern and central Mississippi, southern Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle still face an enhanced threat of severe weather.

Cities like New Orleans and Baton Rouge in Louisiana and Mobile, Alabama, could see a few strong tornadoes, damaging winds and large hail.

The storm could also bring isolated tornadoes, hail, and damaging winds to the area from the Texas-Louisiana border to the Panhandle of Florida north to central Mississippi, Alabama, and western Georgia.

By Thursday, the threat weakens to a slight risk for severe weather as the storm moves towards the East Coast.

In the North and Central US, blizzard conditions

Blizzard conditions in the Northern and Central High Plains are expected to make travel dangerous on snow-covered roads amid 1-2 inches per hour snow rates and winds gusting at 50-60 mph, according to the Storm Prediction Center.

The “one-in-five-year storm” worked its way through parts of Nebraska Tuesday and is expected to linger in the area through the end of the week, NWS metrologist Bill Taylor said.

Blizzard warnings are in place throughout parts of the state and the state’s Department of Transportation said several roadways are closed, including all roadways from Nebraska into Colorado.

Residents will be contending with near zero visibility making travel difficult, as well as possible scattered power outages.

In South Dakota, schools in the Rapid City area closed Tuesday and will remain shuttered on Wednesday due to the snow conditions in the area, the school district said on Facebook.

The wintry weather conditions caused a closure of both east and westbound lanes of Interstate 90 from Rapid City to the Wyoming state line on Tuesday, state transportation officials said.

Heavy snow and gusty winds will likely spread across the Northern Plains into the Upper Midwest Wednesday and Thursday, the Storm Prediction Center said.

Freezing rain and sleet are expected to continue across the Plains and then shift into the Upper Midwest through Wednesday, again making travel dangerous.

“Strong winds and cold temperatures will continue even after this storm ends, creating bitterly cold wind chills,” the National Weather Service said.

As the second storm develops over the Southern Appalachians and moves to Mid-Atlantic on Thursday, residents can expect heavy snow over parts of the Lower Great Lakes, Central Appalachians and the northern Mid-Atlantic.

The signers include racial justice groups, civil rights and civil liberties organizations, LGBTQ organizations, and labor unions.

You can read the entire letter here.

From the letter:



“SFPD’s proposal, if approved, threatens the privacy and safety of city residents and visitors. Police in the United States have killed 1,054 people in the last year. Black Americans are three times more likely than white Americans to be killed during police encounters. San Francisco is no exception; according to Mapping Police Violence, from 2013 to 2021, Black people were 9.7 times as likely and Latinx people were 4.3 times as likely to be killed by SFPD as a white person by population. According to Mission Local, from 2000 to 2021, over 30 percent of fatal police shootings in San Francisco killed Black people, even though Black people were only about 5 percent of the city's population. And despite California having one of the strongest laws governing police use of deadly force in the country, unarmed people and bystanders are killed with disturbing frequency. There is no basis to believe that robots toting explosives might be an exception to police overuse of deadly force. Using robots that are designed to disarm bombs to instead deliver them is a perfect example of this pattern of escalation, and of the militarization of the police force that concerns so many across the city.”





We thank all of the groups who signed onto this letter, and the many groups and residents who attended today’s Stop Killer Robots rally outside of city hall. We again commend Supervisors Walton, Ronen, and Preston for their continued leadership in support of civil rights and civil liberties issues.



The policy passed with a vote of 8-to-3 last week, but is not effective without another vote at the Board of Supervisor meeting on Tuesday, December 6. Responding to public outcry, Supervisor Mar announced he will be changing his vote. We thank him for doing so, and urge other members of the Board to do the same.



Residents must continue reaching out to their supervisors and tell them to vote against SFPD’s killer robots. You can find an email contact for your Board of Supervisors member here, and determine which Supervisor to contact here. Here's text you can use (or edit):",Q4

“Oklahoma’s open transfer law is what parental choice done right looks like,” McCall said. “We are now one of the best states in the country for parental choice that works, thanks to open transfer.”

According to a press release, nearly 11,000 transfer requests have been made since the law changed last year. More than 8,400 of those were approved.

The law requires interdistrict transfers be accepted as long as the receiving district has room and the transferring student’s behavioral and attendance records meet certain standards.

A separate law modified the state funding mechanism to more accurately reflect enrollment changes.

“In less than a year, Oklahoma is already seeing big success with open transfer,” said McCall. “Open transfer is equitably benefiting families in all parts of the state, regardless of geography or income level, without harming public school budgets.”

Another push for vouchers, or scholarships as proponents prefer, is expected next session, particularly if Gov. Kevin Stitt and his candidate for state superintendent of public instruction, Ryan Walters, win their Nov. 8 general elections.

Campaigns and elections: The Tulsa Press Club is holding a watch party for Wednesday’s 5:30 p.m. televised debate between Stitt and Democrat Joy Hofmeister.

The debate is presented by Oklahoma City’s KWTV and NonDoc, and is being held at the Will Rogers Theater in Oklahoma City. It is expected to be the only live public debate between Stitt and Hofmeister before the Nov. 8 general election.

Watch party reservations are recommended, and reserved tables with beverage packages are available. Contact becki@tulsapressclub.org.

Democratic state superintendent candidate Jena Nelson will speak at the Press Club at 5:30 p.m. Friday.

The Oklahoma Medical Association, which has often been at odds with Stitt, endorsed Hofmeister through its political action committee.

Americans for Prosperity-Oklahoma endorsed Republican state House of Representatives candidates Brad Banks (HD 70) and Paul Hassink (HD 79).

While some polling indicates the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe is tightening, it also shows Republican nominee Markwayne Mullin leading by 8-10 percentage points entering the last few weeks of the campaign. Mullin has not only avoided appearing with Democrat Kendra Horn and the other two candidates in the race, Libertarian Robert Murphy and independent Ray Woods, but he’s avoided most state media as well. He did spend some time in the Tulsa County Republican Party booth at the Tulsa State Fair and made an appearance on former South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy’s Fox News Radio program.

Mullin’s advertising campaign seems to mostly feature him and his family.

Horn, meanwhile, is trying to convince voters that Mullin is a self-dealing multi-millionaire with little interest in everyday Oklahomans.

The other U.S. Senate race is even more low-key. Incumbent James Lankford has a huge financial and name recognition advantage over Democrat Madison Horn, not to mention over Libertarian Kenneth Blevins and independent Michael L. Delaney, and seems to have a comfortable lead in the polls, too.

Former Kansas U.S. Sen. and Gov. Sam Brownback endorsed Lankford.

Dark times: The dark money machine is cranking again.

Unidentified sources of all stripes have already spent millions of dollars on Oklahoma primary and runoff elections, and now they are back at it as the general election approaches.

Stitt, who has been in the dark money crosshairs for more than a year, is the target of at least two mail pieces and one TV ad launched in the past weeks.

The TV ad is attributed to the Oklahoma Project, an apparently home-grown dark money organization that has been zinging Stitt since early 2021.

The mail pieces, which focus on Stitt’s education agenda, and particularly his support of using taxpayers’ money for private school tuition, say they are paid for by Leadership Action Fund Inc. at the Wilmington, Delaware, address of the Corporation Trust Center. The Corporation Trust Center is reportedly a one-story building that serves as the mailing address for more than 285,000 businesses worldwide.

On the other side of the dark money fight over school vouchers, mail pieces attacking state Rep. Melissa Provenzano and other opponents of such proposals have begun hitting mailboxes.

Who is behind the dark money campaigns won’t be known for more than a week at least, or quite possibly ever.

Independent and electioneering expenditures for the general election don’t have to be reported until the 14 days prior to an election, and those made prior to the 14 days don’t have to be reported until Oct. 31 — a confusing arrangement, to say the least.

Even then, the true source of the funds is often hidden behind private corporations and non-profit entities; in some cases, the expenditures aren’t reported at all.

We, too: Oklahoma Attorney General John O’Connor added Oklahoma to a couple more lawsuits filed by Republican attorneys general, including the long-running case of an Oregon bakery fined $135,000 because it refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.

That 2013 case, Klein v. Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries, is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, where it is being argued on First Amendment grounds.

“The government should protect religious freedom, not threaten it,” O’Connor said in announcing Oklahoma would be joining 16 other attorneys general in an amicus brief. “Every Oklahoman and American has the right to express their First Amendment rights without fear.”

O’Connor also announced he has added Oklahoma to a list of states objecting to a Transportation Department program to track and regulate greenhouse gas.

“We will not stand for this, which is why I am leading a coalition urging the U.S. Department of Transportation to decline to adopt Biden’s unlawful proposed mandate,” O’Connor said in a press release.

Meetings and events: The Republican Women’s Club South Tulsa United will meet at 9:30 a.m. Monday at Jenks City Hall, 211 N. Elm St., Jenks.

The Tulsa Area Republican Assembly will meet at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday at Golden Corral, 9711 E. 71st St.

Oklahoma Observer publisher Arnold Hamilton and Corporation Commission nominee Warigia Bowman will be featured at the Creek County Democratic Party meeting at 6 p.m. Thursday at La Margarita, 1215 New Sapulpa Road, Sapulpa.

Union School Board member Joey Reyes will speak to the Tulsa County Democratic Party meeting at 6:30 p.m. Oct. 27, at Baxter’s Interurban, 717 S. Houston Ave.

Bottom lines: Besides shifting Office of Management and Enterprises Services director Steven Harpe to Corrections director last week, Stitt appointed Oklahoma City energy executives John Laws as secretary of budget, the statewide chief financial officer, and John Suter as chief operating officer and interim OMES director. … Five Oklahoma communities have been awarded almost $1.2 million in Emergency Rural Health Care Grants by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. …Fourth District Congressman Tom Cole and 5th District Congresswoman Stephanie Bice are among those scheduled to speak Thursday at the Oklahoma Aerospace and Defense Innovation Institute Symposium in Norman. … State Rep. Logan Phillips, R-Mounds, who lost his June primary amid a deluge of dark money ads, ripped Stitt for vetoing American Rescue Plan funds for emergency management and improvements to the OETA system, which acts as the state’s emergency broadcast network.

It’s a strange and surreal place where up is down and black is white and the two Republican members of the Cochise County Board of Supervisors have lost their ever-living minds.

It seems Supervisors Peggy Judd and Tom Crosby had this bright this idea that if they just declined to certify the election results in their ruby-red county that …

Well, I’m not sure what they thought would happen, but their decision to essentially disenfranchise their own voters – most of them Republicans − seems to be a protest of Maricopa County’s election. A protest that, if it stands, could actually land the supervisors in jail and another Democrat in Congress.

2 prosecutors say supervisors should be jailed

Without Cochise County’s vote, Republican Juan Ciscomani would lose what should be his southern Arizona congressional seat to Democrat Kirsten Engel. The supervisors’ shenanigans also could flip the state superintendent’s race from Republican Tom Horne to Democrat Kathy Hoffman and dash Republican Abe Hamadeh’s chances of overtaking Democrat Kris Mayes when the attorney general’s race is recounted next month.

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

Geniuses, those Cochise County officials.

Experts:Assistant AG who blasted election should leave investigation

Former Attorney General Terry Goddard, a Democrat, and former Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley, a Republican, on Tuesday called for the pair to be criminally charged for refusing to follow state law and certify their county’s election.

“We believe deeply that the rule of law dictates that public officials be held accountable when they refuse to comply with their legal obligations – all the more so when those officials’ actions threaten to undo the proper administration and integrity of elections, disenfranchise thousands of voters, and potentially even alter the results of some races,” they wrote.

Naturally, MAGA land went nuts about that

Naturally, MAGA land blew up on social media, aghast all across America that anyone would dare suggest that the Cochise County supervisors should have to follow the law. It’s madness, they tell us.

“So in AZ, a Democrat county attorney told a Republican ELECTED member of the Board of Supervisors that if they did NOT vote the way they were TOLD TO VOTE, specifically to certify the CORRUPT election, that they would charge them with a Class 6 Felony,” tweeted one guy. “Something's not right.”

“That is known as extortion where I come from,” a Michigan “patriot” tweeted.

“Being told to vote a certain way or you’ll be charged with a felony?” a Louisiana woman added. “You honestly think that’s legal? Show me the specific law that makes voter intimidation legal.”

Leave it to Kari Lake to fan the flames of misinformation.

“Something's rotten in Denmark ... ,” her campaign replied.

It surely is, when you have a candidate so stuffed with sour grapes that she’s willing to burn down the state.

Arizona law is clear about certifying elections

For those still tethered to reality, ARS 16-642 says county supervisors “shall” certify the election within 20 days of the vote – meaning by Nov. 28.

It doesn’t say they can refuse to certify the vote to protest another county’s printer problems. It doesn’t say they can toss the ballots of their own 47,000 voters into the trash because they’re angry that Kari Lake and company lost the election.

It says shall.

Here’s another law. ARS 16-1010 says that “a person charged with performance of any duty under any law relating to elections who knowingly refuses to perform such duty … is guilty of a class 6 felony.”

Lake appears quite happy for those supervisors to become felons and spend some quality time behind bars.

“I wish somebody would say, ’You know what? Arrest me then. I don’t care,’ “ she said on Tuesday, on Steve Bannon’s podcast. “We need people with courage to say, ’class what felony? Go ahead, go for it, arrest me.’ Because this is a botched election.”

Private cash was outlawed, but who's counting?

Of course, Lake will have her chance to prove her claim that thousands of people were disenfranchised in Maricopa County – a place where turnout exceeded the state average. She can challenge the election results in court, but first there have to be official results to challenge.

That means after Dec. 5 or certainly no later than Dec. 8, the date by which the state must certify the results … without or without the Cochise vote. Secretary of State/Gov.-elect Katie Hobbs and others have sued Cochise County, asking a judge to order the supervisors to certify the election so that the county’s 47,000 votes will count.

A hearing is set for Thursday afternoon.

The Cochise supervisors, meanwhile, are looking to hire and attorney -- their own, having advised them that what they're doing is illegal -- and hoping someone will come forward to foot the bill. That would be yet another violation of law, given that Gov. Doug Ducey and the Arizona Legislature earlier this year barred the use of private funds for election purposes.

But, hey, what’s one more law trampled?

Let every GOP winner lose over sour grapes?

It goes without saying that a judge should order the Cochise County supervisors to certify the county’s election results.

Without that certification, Juan Ciscomani will lose what should be a Republican seat in Congress and Republican Tom Horne will not become Arizona’s next state superintendent. Without that, Republican Abe Hamadeh has no hope of winning a recount.

Meanwhile, Cochise County supervisors should be prosecuted – and recalled – for refusing to follow the law. Also, for demonstrating a level of crazy unparalleled anywhere in the state – and in Arizona, that is saying something.

As Republican Sen. T.J. Shope put it: “Imagine believing losing races after-the-fact was an actual “winning” strategy … Here we are as Republicans pinning our hopes on the Dem Sec of State to sue a Republican county to order them to do what Arizona Statute requires them to do. We live in an upside down world … ”

Upside down and curiouser and curiouser, with each passing day. Imagine a candidate for governor, urging county officials to flush away the elections of her fellow Republicans because she cannot accept the fact that she lost.

https://www.centralmaine.com/2022/12/20/maine-voices-a-sensible-gun-permit-law-exists-for-hunting-in-maine-its-time-we-expand-that-2/,Maine Voices: A sensible gun permit law exists for hunting in Maine. It’s time we expand that.,"Thank God that November’s active shooter scare in eleven Maine schools was a hoax.

Maine, however, is just one of a handful of states that has not had a mass murder tragedy like the shootings at Uvalde, Sandy Hook, UVA, Virginia Tech, Parkland or Columbine. A common theme in these shootings is that the shooters use semi-automatic firearms with large magazines, often bought with no permit-to-purchase requirement. The Uvalde shooter bought two AR-15 platform rifles and 375 rounds of ammunition off the shelf just days before the killing.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR Peggy McGehee is a recently retired Portland attorney, a 2022 adjunct professor at the University of Maine School of Law, a mother and grandmother.

Today in Maine any adult, no matter how unstable (absent a court finding of dangerous instability upon a doctor’s testimony), can buy and carry a semi-automatic firearm capable of firing dozens of rounds without reloading, with no background check, no permit, no waiting period. This is because, in Maine, no permit is required to buy or carry any gun – even AR-15 style guns with magazines of 15, 30, even 45 rounds.

What can we in Maine do to help protect our children from a shooter with a semi-automatic firearm capable of mowing them down in seconds?

We can support the passage of a law to require a permit to buy or carry any semi-automatic firearm that is already prohibited for hunting in Maine.

Maine law prohibits hunters from using “any autoloading firearm having a magazine capacity of more than 5 cartridges” (excepting small caliber and short-barrel firearms). Such a semi-automatic firearms permitting law could use Maine’s same permit application standards that are in Maine’s existing voluntary gun permit statute. So this would be a “homegrown” law fitting with Maine’s culture and laws.

Such a law would meet the constitutional requirements of the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association. vs. Bruen.

Justice Clarence Thomas’s decision in Bruen says the Second Amendment right to bear arms extends to “law-abiding, responsible citizens.” His decision thus distinguishes between New York’s unconstitutional “may issue for proper cause” permit statute and the constitutional “shall issue” permit statutes of other states.

A Maine “shall issue” semi-automatic firearm permit law would meet Bruen’s standards – and would be less restrictive than the “shall issue” permit statutes of other states, as it would apply only to semi-automatic firearms that are already not legal for hunting in Maine, and would not apply to any other guns. It also would not require permits for current owners of semi-automatic firearms to continue to possess them in their homes.

Can we all support the passage of such a law? We gun owners, hunters, Republicans, Democrats, parents and grandparents? If such a law were passed we would for certain reduce the risk of a mass shooting by a semi-automatic firearm in Maine.

This year, and particularly since Uvalde, there have been many letters to the Portland Press Herald pleading for Maine to do something to improve gun safety.

A semi-automatic firearms permitting law would not only avoid the legal obstacles presented by Bruen to other gun safety measures, but would be limited to semi-automatic firearms that are already prohibited in Maine for hunting, so it should have a chance at passage as a reasonable, and constitutional, measure.

Please contact your legislator in support of such a law and please sign up with the Show Up Network of Maine’s Gun Safety Coalition, in support of the gun safety bills already pending in the Maine Legislature. Let’s do what we can, for our kids and grandkids.",Q4

https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/10/were-fears-about-the-infodemic-overblown/,Were fears about the “infodemic” overblown?,"Ever since the earliest days of the Covid-19 pandemic, we — and we do mean “we” as in “literally all of us” — have been deeply concerned about the quality of information that people were consuming on the issue. Conspiracy theories have abounded since spring 2020, and despite the urgings of the UN secretary-general and the WHO, among others, information about the pandemic in general and vaccines in particular has continued to resemble a minefield.

But the availability of junk information by itself does not an “infodemic” make. There are other steps in the influence of low-quality information that have often been assumed but perhaps not yet sufficiently empirically tested: To what degree are people consuming that junk information compared with higher-quality news? To what extent are people being cocooned in echo chambers reaffirming existing Covid-19 beliefs? And what influence is that information having on their support for pandemic mitigation efforts?

We’re starting to get some solid initial data to answer those questions, with three studies on those issues published in the past six weeks. The answers from those studies are complex and nuanced (as always), but on the whole, things may not have been quite as bad as we feared.

First, Sacha Altay and two colleagues at Oxford’s Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, Rasmus Kleis Nielsen and Richard Fletcher, published a paper (available for free from the Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media) that sought to quantify the share of web traffic that went to untrustworthy versus trustworthy news sites in the pandemic’s early days.

They tracked web traffic and Facebook engagement in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and France before and after the pandemic began and found that a vanishingly small proportion of traffic went to untrustworthy sites (as rated by NewsGuard). Those untrustworthy sites drew much more engagement on Facebook, but were still dominated by trustworthy sources there as well. Facebook engagement and traffic to news sites were up about a quarter from 2019 to 2020 overall, with most of that increase going to trustworthy sites, rather than untrustworthy ones.

There were some asterisks to that good news: The study didn’t measure traffic or engagement for non-news organizations, which may have been a major source of untrustworthy Covid-19 information. And the reach of untrustworthy information was significantly higher in the U.S. and France than in the U.K. and Germany.

In a second study, a team of 19 international researchers led by Alon Zoizner looked at COVID-19 information consumption as it related to like-minded information. In a study published in the journal Political Communication, they used a massive two-wave survey of 14,000 people across 16 European countries plus Israel to determine whether and why people were people were consuming information that challenged their political views.

Zoizner and his colleagues reasoned that the uncertainty produced by a crisis like the pandemic would lead to a more acute need for useful information, which would increase consumption of information countering one’s political views (i.e., “cross-cutting information”). The results of the study bore that rationale out: Both like-minded and cross-cutting information consumption increased after the pandemic, especially for those among whom concern about the pandemic was greatest.

The connection between pandemic concern and cross-cutting information consumption was higher in countries where Covid was more severe, where the government response was more permissive, and where democratic institutions were weaker. This, the authors suggested, indicated that when the need for quality information was truly greatest, people were most willing to go beyond their like-minded sources.

Finally, Andrew Anderson and Joshua Scacco published a study in American Behavioral Scientist looking at the effects of all this Covid information consumption. Specifically, how did people’s Covid information sources influence their level of support for Covid mitigation policies?

To find out, they surveyed 600 Florida residents in April 2020, measuring their consumption of COVID-19 information from legacy news, cable news, Facebook, government sources, and personal sources. They found that, even after controlling for partisanship, TV news consumption played a significant role in support for mitigation strategies — Fox News viewership was associated with opposition to Covid mitigation, and CNN, MSNBC, and network news were associated with support.

The control for partisanship is a key factor here. It indicates that the influence of Fox News is not simply a product of conservatives being more likely to oppose mitigation and also more likely to watch Fox News. It suggests, instead, that the cable channels (and network TV news) may have had an influence apart from simple partisan audience self-selection. On the flip side, neither Facebook nor government communication (e.g., press conferences by Donald Trump and other elected officials) were significantly associated with views on mitigation.

Taken together, the studies present a handful of emerging data points in our picture of what information consumption looked like in the early days of the pandemic. And the picture they paint isn’t as bleak as we’ve tended to fear: News consumption was way up (as we might have expected, and as other studies have shown), but it was largely trustworthy sources, and often cross-cutting sources, that got much of the attention. It may be, though, that as we’ve seen previously, the greater effect on attitudes may have been Fox News viewership than social media sources.

Research roundup

“Stories that don’t make the news: Navigating a white newsroom as a Black female reporter.” By Tyra L. Jackson, in Journalism Practice. This powerful article tells a vital story, critically examines newsroom culture, and demonstrates why we need autoethnographies in journalism and media studies. How rare are autoethnographies, such as Jackson’s? A search on the website for Journalism Practice finds just two autoethnographies, Jackson’s and another from 2007, the journal’s debut year. Jackson writes that the purpose of her autoethnography is to tell her story of workplace bullying to “better white newsroom culture” and to ask “newsrooms to consider how the actions and culture of white newsrooms can negatively affect Black female reporters.”

Explaining her methodological choice, Jackson writes that autoethnographies “help me and others share our encounters with discrimination.” Autoethnographies permit researchers to view oneself in relation to culture. As Jackson writes, “my experiences might be applicable to similar experiences Black female journalists have in white newsrooms, as my emotional recollections can help others provide meaning to their experiences via this method.”

Jackson uses the lens of critical race theory to examine her experiences in a southern newsroom. She weaves relevant literature and personal reflection to provide an inside story about unethical behavior, workplace bullying, and discrimination (including racial microaggressions). “Although the bullying I experienced was not explicitly racist (i.e., the bullies did not use racial slurs, hate speech, or have a blatant disregard for Blacks), it engaged my position as a Black woman in a white newsroom,” Jackson writes. “This type of bullying can be understood as racially motivated, even when the perpetrators may not perceive themselves as ‘racist.’”

Jackson progresses through her experiences, first recalling her enthusiasm in starting at the organization. Early on, she felt that her new co-workers “would run into battle with me.” Soon, though, it just became a fight. Jackson writes about how two white female colleagues bullied her, lied to and about her, and claimed she stole their story ideas and assignments. They called her unapproachable and played to the stereotype of the angry Black woman. The managing editor, a white man and friend of the two white female colleagues, ignored the bullying and dismissed Jackson’s attempt at diplomatically resolving the issue. Jackson felt isolated.

One of the most poignant anecdotes from the piece is when Jackson writes about sitting silently during a story meeting. She had ideas flowing through her mind, but she knew it was pointless to open her mouth. “I isolated myself because I did not feel welcomed,” she writes. Even a meeting with the editor-in-chief about her colleagues’ behavior did not resolve the issue. Jackson eventually left for a public relations job: “I was happy to have a stable job and leave the newspaper behind.”

“An intersectional analysis of U.S. journalists’ experiences with hostile sources.” By Kelsey Mesmer, in Journalism & Communication Monographs. Hostility toward journalists and journalism has long been a challenge around the world, including in the United States. As the author notes in this piece, newspaper offices in the 19th and early 20th centuries often were ransacked or destroyed. However, incidents of animosity and violence against individual journalists have increased in recent years, and so has the academic attention to these issues. Studies have examined online and offline harassment of journalists, but mostly from people outside the journalistic process (e.g., social media users, television viewers, etc.). Less is known about hostility directly from journalists’ sources — the people the journalists interview for news stories.

For this study, Mesmer draws on 38 in-depth interviews with journalists who have faced hostility from sources. Using the theory of intersectionality, she categories four forms of hostility from news sources and examines editor/manager responses to the hostility and how the hostility affected journalistic routines and news products. She identifies four forms of source-based hostility as (1) stemming from a general distrust of the news media, (2) source boundary crossing, (3) safety-violating hostility, and (4) microaggressions.

First, hostility stemming from general distrust was experienced by all by one participant, a 67-year-old white freelance writer who conducts most of his reporting remotely. Examples included claims of “fake news,” accusations of bias, and having interview requests denied because sources did not trust the media. Second, participants experienced situations of boundary crossing that broke professional norms of engagement and made them feel uncomfortable and vulnerable. Such hostility only happened to female participants in Mesmer’s sample. Examples included sources repeatedly calling the journalists on their personal phones, going above the journalists to complain to their bosses, and posting defamatory content about the journalists on social media. Third, participants experienced cases of safety-violating hostility, either causing the journalists direct physical and/or emotional harm or threatening physical harm. Though rare, these were the most intense and dangerous examples of hostility. One female reporter faced unwanted sexual touching and advances, and another female journalist had a phone slapped out of her hand twice by a source. Fourth, journalists faced numerous examples of microaggressions, including condescending tone or being treated as inferior.

Mesmer also examined the journalists’ editors’ responses, which too often were a lack of response. Participants even said that when they reported threats and verbal abuses to their superiors, the leaders verbalized support but then did not take action or follow up on situations. In general, Mesmer found the news leaders did not “protect and defend their reporters” and that they “valued the story” more than the personal safety of the employees.

“How people integrate news into their everyday routines: A context-centered approach to news habits.” By Tim Groot Kormelink, in Digital Journalism. Since Bernard Berelson’s landmark 1949 study on what “missing the newspaper” means, the importance of audience habit has been explored by researchers. For instance, scholars have studied what compels people to subscribe to news, what news organizations do to promote habits, and how audience members’ habits change over time (for instance, during the pandemic). However, less is understood about the critical early days of a user’s new subscription and what that pivotal period means for potential habit creation.

Groot Kormelink, working with students from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, used a novel qualitative approach to address this issue. He conducted a qualitative study of 66 participants in the Netherlands who received a free three-week subscription (either print or digital) to a publication (ranging from national to regional publications) of their choice. Specifically, the study explores how participants adopt (or not) new subscriptions into their everyday habits and what assists or hinders this adoption in the early days of subscription. Or, put another way, Groot Kormelink explored why participants receive a free subscription yet do not use it.

The study’s key finding reveals visibility is vital. The study found participants, even those with positive initial experiences, tended to forget about their new subscription and that visibility, which generates repetition, is requisite for habit formation. Visual cues — app notifications, open browser tabs, social media posts, emails, or the printed newspaper — reminded participants to read their subscriptions. This was especially important for the digital formats, which lacked the obvious visual reminder of the printed newspaper itself.

Groot Kormelink found additional key obstacles for the participants in converting the free subscription into a habit. One obstacle is theirotherhabits. For instance, participants expressed a desire to form a new habit with the subscription but failed to do so because their existing habits (watching television or videos, etc.) were too strong and won their attention and time.

Another obstacle found was the cognitive commitment, the sheer mental work, of reading the newspaper — or even motivating yourself tostartreading the newspaper. Participants considered reading the newspaper a mental hurdle, viewing the process as a full commitment or one not to even attempt at all. In short, they found it hard to commit their time and energy to their free subscription. Ultimately, this research offers an insightful inside look at why initial news use either falters or fosters a potential news habit.

“War of the words: How individuals respond to ‘fake news,’ ‘misinformation,’ ‘disinformation,’ and ‘online falsehoods.'” By Edson C. Tandoc and Seth Kai Seet, in Journalism Practice. As the authors write in this brilliantly straightforward and important piece of research, “the terms people use matter.” That idea is at the heart of this survey-based approach to studying “fake news” and similar terms.

The term “fake news” peaked in usage (per Google search) in November 2016, around the time that Donald Trump was elected U.S. president. The term remains widely used, but academics have argued that it lost its meaning as it became politicized and weaponized. This study examines “fake news” as a concept and how the public reacts to it compared with other terms, such as “misinformation,” “disinformation,” and “online falsehoods.” The latter term is particularly important in Singapore, where the government uses the term “online falsehoods” and defines them as “false statements of facts.”

The authors, both from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, used an online survey of 1,015 people with a nationally representative adult sample. The participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups based on the wording used in the questionnaire, split virtually equally between fake news, misinformation, disinformation and online falsehoods. The participants answered the same set of questions (with the different terms) based on their perceptions of falsity, intentionality, general concern, seriousness and need for solutions.

The study found that the term “fake news” had the highest level of perceptions of falsity and intentionality and also rated the highest in level of concern, perceived severity, and requiring a solution. “Disinformation” was rated the lowest across the board in all five categories.

“Running up against a brick wall: U.S. metajournalistic discourse of gender equality in newsrooms.” By Margaretha Geertsema-Sligh and Tim P. Vos, in Journalism Studies. Journalism literature, both mainstream and academic, long has chronicled the industry’s failures with gender equality. An endless stream of stories highlight the lowlights — for example, that women journalists are underrepresented and marginalized in U.S. newsrooms, in particular in leadership positions.

However, as the authors here argue, there is “much we do not know about how journalists process this knowledge.” To address that, Geertsema-Sligh and Vos, drawing on institutional theory and feminist critiques, examine more than 500 online articles and blog posts in U.S. news industry publications during a 17-year period (2002-2019). Overall, the authors argue that “knowing how journalists make sense of journalism’s poor record on gender equality tells us much about the institution of journalism itself.”

The findings confirm ongoing concerns about the disadvantaged status of women journalists — attributed predominantly to workplace culture and inflexible hours. The texts analyzed do signal a need for organizational change, but the study also shows how an underlying stress is placed on individual women journalists to play the most important role in this change. As Geertsema-Sligh and Vos write, “newsroom culture was recognized as a problem, yet some of the solutions read like individual self-help advice suggesting that women have to change, not the organizations.”

Encouragingly, the analysis found that authors of industry-focused online articles and blog posts, in general, tend to challenge the institution of journalism for perpetuating gender inequality in newsrooms. They tie gender equality to larger audiences, higher revenue possibilities, and a reflection of more diverse societies. However, as Geertsema-Sligh and Vos also write, “despite these calls for change, journalism as an institution seems limited in its response to gender inequality in newsrooms.”

An RQ1 Read: Journalistic Autonomy: A Genealogy of a Concept, by Henrik Örnebring and Michael Karlsson

This is part of an occasional series of summaries by RQ1 readers of notable recent books on news and journalism. This month’s summary is from Will Mari, an assistant professor at the Manship School of Mass Communication at LSU. If there’s a recent research-oriented book on news or journalism that you’d like to write about, let us know!

In Henrik Örnebring and Michael Karlsson’s Journalistic Autonomy: The Genealogy of a Concept (University of Missouri Press, 2022), both authors tackle a tricky topic that has heretofore been either elusive or, at best, secondary to most journalism studies scholars and media historians. And while Örnebring and Karlsson point to some noteworthy exceptions (Helle Sjøvaag, Michael Schudson, Theodore Glasser and Marc Gunther, Michael McDevitt and John C. Merrill, among others), they are — though they would be reticent to say this themselves — exceptionally bold and clever (and winsome) in the hard work of carving out a new genealogical media history of the idea of autonomy — independence — for journalism and journalists.

They successfully make the case for its inclusion in the oldest Ur-terms (the “god-term” status of notions such as “facts,” “truth,” “reality,” “the public,” the “Fourth Estate” and, of course, “objectivity”) in journalism, building on the important scholarship of Barbie Zelizer, James Carey, David Mindich, and others. They are careful and historically grounded in making their case, and do so in intellectually rewarding and consistent ways. Their analytical approach is based on four vital ideas about the way autonomy works in journalism today, namely 1) that autonomy is relational, that 2) autonomy requires boundaries, 3) autonomy implies agency (and the use of that agency) and 4) that autonomy must have a reason — a purpose — for its existence, both within and without newsrooms, and in and out of the broader democratic, Western-centric, capitalism-funded context that it is often found.

It is difficult to overstate the importance of Örnebring and Karlsson’s project. They engage with autonomy in relation to what they identify as its key attributes or aspects, including independence from the state, political interests and the market, but also from sources, how it acts in the workplace and what it means for and in relation to journalism’s audiences, along with how it functions with regards to technology — but also, crucially, they talk about what that independence should be for or to what end it should act in a world where privilege is uneven and power often wielded by elites at the expense of the weak.

In this effort, they are inspired by Isaiah Berlin. Journalism and its practitioners, its scholars and its audiences, and even, if they were more honest, its enemies, should pay attention to what will be regarded, rightly so, as a seminal work in journalism studies.",Q4
https://www.jta.org/2022/11/14/culture/a-jewish-museum-exhibit-features-the-palestinian-flag-some-visitors-wonder-if-it-belongs,A Jewish museum exhibit features the Palestinian flag. Some visitors wonder if it belongs.,"(J. The Jewish News of Northern California via JTA) — Tucked in the far corner of a large, brightly-lit exhibition hall on the ground floor of the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco, there is a delicate-looking piece of art with a strong political message.

At first glance, it appears to be three circular vases with flowers in them. The ceramic vases sit on shelves attached to the wall, and colorful collages hang above them. On closer inspection, visitors will notice that the flowers are made out of paper and that affixed to each vase is an image of the Palestinian flag printed on foam board.

A nearby label written by the curators of the exhibit, titled “Tikkun: For the Cosmos, the Community, and Ourselves,” explains that the piece was inspired by a conversation the artist, Tosha Stimage of Berkeley, had with a Palestinian man. He told Stimage about the plants that are native to Palestine — “a place which he can no longer access due to the ongoing conflict in the region,” the curators write.

The label also includes a note about the flag: “Some may find its presence at The CJM troubling or confusing, while others may find it appropriate and forthright. Stimage recognizes the potential for these divergent responses and hopes to use them as a means of generating dialogue.”

On a Sunday afternoon in October, Maury Ostroff read the label and walked away without inspecting the artwork.

Asked how the presence of the flag made him feel, Ostroff, who is Jewish and lives in Muir Beach, in Marin County, replied, “Unhappy.”

Why?

“It’s not offensive to me in the same way that a swastika is. My skin is a little bit thicker than that. But I wish it weren’t here.”

He added, “What’s so Jewish about this? What’s so ‘tikkun olam’ about all of this?”

For the “Tikkun” exhibit, which opened Feb. 17 and runs through Jan. 8, the CJM invited both Jewish and non-Jewish Bay Area artists to contribute new works on the theme of repair, however they chose to interpret it. “No one is listening to us,” the piece by Stimage, who is not Jewish, is the first work of art featuring the Palestinian flag to be shown at CJM in recent memory; the museum could not say when or if the flag has been displayed on its walls before.

The piece prompted several internal conversations among CJM staff when it was first submitted and, since it has been on display, has generated a variety of responses from museumgoers who have left comments in a box at the entrance to the exhibit. Intentionally or not, Stimage has raised numerous questions with the artwork, including: Does a work of art that is sympathetic to the Palestinian struggle for statehood belong in a Jewish museum? And what is the role of a contemporary Jewish museum, anyway?

“To truly be a contemporary art museum, meaning embedded in the contemporary issues of our day, our job is to provide a platform for dialogue and to share a diversity of perspectives on our walls,” said Chad Coerver, CJM’s executive director since September 2021. “If any institution [like ours] took the path of withholding artwork that troubled our staff, our board or our community, it would be very difficult to mount exhibitions.”

CJM is a member of the Council of American Jewish Museums, a network of 76 museums across the country. CAJM does not have guidelines about the kind of art its member museums can and cannot display, according to Executive Director Melissa Yaverbaum.

J. reached out to several CAJM member museums in New York, Los Angeles and other places by email to ask if they had ever shown artwork with Palestinian iconography or works by Palestinian artists. The museums declined to answer or did not respond.

In recent years, two Jewish museums have been embroiled in controversy over issues relating to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Spertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership in Chicago staged an exhibit in 2008 on Israeli and Palestinian concepts of homeland that included maps and portraits of Palestinians. Following outcry from members of the local Jewish community who felt the exhibit presented Israel in a negative light, the museum decided to close the exhibit after only a few weeks. And in 2019, the director of the Jewish Museum Berlin resigned after the museum tweeted a link to a pro-BDS article in a German newspaper. (The museum previously came under fire for welcoming anti-Zionist scholar Judith Butler and representatives of Iran.)

In a joint interview with J., two CJM staffers who worked on “Tikkun” — co-curator Qianjin Montoya, who is not Jewish, and a Jewish senior curator who served in an advisory role, Heidi Rabben — shared the story of how Stimage’s piece came to be in the exhibit. (Montoya’s co-curator for the exhibit, Arianne Gelardin, no longer works at the museum.)

Since 2009, CJM has invited local artists from different backgrounds to create new work as part of the museum’s annual Dorothy Saxe Invitational. The idea for “Tikkun” was hatched before the pandemic put the planning process on hold. Once the CJM and Saxe — a local philanthropist and art collector — agreed on the theme, the co-curators invited artists “already engaged in healing through their relationship to community or in their practice of daily life,” Gelardin told J. last February.

The 30 artists who accepted the museum’s invitation were given only four months to conceive of and submit new works. That was likely the shortest timeline in the history of the invitational, which has been held 11 previous times, according to the museum. Each artist received a packet of materials compiled by CJM staff, with input from the Shalom Hartman Institute, a non-degree granting Jewish education center, to guide their thinking on “tikkun.”

Stimage was invited to participate because she is “very active” in the Bay Area and because “her work reflects ideas of community and connection,” Montoya said.

The curators said Stimage’s inclusion of the Palestinian flag in her submitted piece came as a surprise and prompted challenging conversations. However, they noted that they found the content of some of the other artists’ work surprising, too, and that it’s not unusual for contemporary artists to push the envelope in their work.

“I wouldn’t say we expected to receive a piece about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but we weren’t steering anyone away from that, either,” Rabben told J., adding that the submission guidelines did not place any topic off limits. “That’s a commitment from the museum to authentically represent the creative spirit of the artists that we’re working with,” she said.

Still, the curators said they engaged in a dialogue with Stimage in order to better understand each aspect of her piece and her overall intentions. Through those conversations, the curators learned that Stimage wanted to explore a moment of “rupture,” and that through her piece she hoped to communicate “that before healing or repair might happen, you have to first acknowledge that rupture,” Rabben said.

Coerver, who was involved in some of the conversations, stressed that “careful consideration” was given to including the piece in the exhibit. “We felt an artwork addressing the plight of the Palestinians was appropriate in an exhibition on healing and repair,” he said. (No work submitted as part of the Dorothy Saxe Invitational has ever been outright rejected, the museum said.)

Stimage did not respond to interview requests from J. According to a CV on her website, she was born in Jackson, Mississippi, and earned an MFA from California College of the Arts in 2016. She is a past fellow at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and was an artist-in-residence at Facebook in 2018. She also owns a floral gift shop in Oakland called Saint Flora.

Her work often touches on Black identity; she created a piece honoring Sandra Bland, an African-American woman whose 2015 arrest and death in a Texas jail cell sparked protests, and contributed to a 2019 San Francisco Art Institute exhibit on the Black Panther Party.

“I have a responsibility to create things that will, to the best of my present knowledge, do more good than harm, heal, inspire and uplift other humans,” she told the San Francisco Bay View National Black Newspaper in 2015.

Stimage’s precise views on Israel are unknown. CJM referred J. to her artist statement for “No one is listening to us,” which reads: “Olive, sage, and sumac are flowering plants native to the Mediterranean (including regions of Gaza and the West Bank) that have a direct relationship to contested ancestral land and affect the livelihood of so many Palestinian farmers and families caught in the conflict. They are positioned in the space of The Contemporary Jewish Museum as a metaphor for the ongoing conflict over land rights and the desperate need for restoration and healing of an age-old wound.”

The curators told J. that during their conversations with Stimage about her piece, they asked her why including images of the Palestinian flag was important to her but did not request that she remove them.

“We determined that none of [the piece’s] components in and of themselves signified something problematic or concerning,” Rabben said. “Of course, we had the awareness that the symbol [of the flag] will be read in a variety of ways by a variety of people.”

(Rabben pointed out that the exhibit includes other works with national symbols rendered in provocative ways, such as a black-and-white photograph of an American flag that was torn apart and partially reassembled by Mexican-American artist Jose Arias.)

The Palestinian flag — which contains the Pan-Arab colors of black, white, green and red — was adopted by the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1964. Since then, it has been the primary symbol of Palestinian nationalism.

For decades, the PLO was considered an enemy organization by Israel, and anything associated with it “had no place in Israeli public life,” said Eran Kaplan, an Israeli-born professor of Israel studies at San Francisco State University. Israel never went so far as to ban the flag. However, during the First Intifada, which lasted from 1987 to 1993, Israeli soldiers sometimes followed orders to confiscate the flag from protesters in the West Bank and Gaza.

With the signing of the Oslo Accord in 1993, Israel and the PLO recognized each other as negotiating partners. Yet the Palestinian flag remains a contentious symbol in Israel today. Kaplan noted that it recently served as a flashpoint during the funeral procession of Shireen Abu Akleh, the Palestinian American broadcaster who was killed in the West Bank in May. (The IDF conducted a review and admitted that the Israeli soldier who shot her had most likely misidentified her as an armed militant.) After warning Abu Akleh’s family not to display the flag, Israeli police attacked mourners in East Jerusalem, ripping flags out of their hands and off of the vehicle carrying her casket.

Today, the flag holds different meanings for Israelis and American Jews from different generations and political persuasions.

“There are large segments in Israeli society who view any form of Palestinian national identity as a threat to the existence of Israel,” Kaplan said. “There are others who view the PLO as legitimate partners in any form of negotiations [over the creation of a Palestinian state], but there’s an absolute split over those questions.”

Given the sensitive nature of Stimage’s work and others in the exhibit, the curators decided to solicit feedback from visitors via comment cards available at the entrance to the hall. Rabben said the museum has received a number of comments specifically about “No one is listening to us,” most of which were positive. “The majority of those comments were ‘Thank you for offering space for this topic at the museum,’” she said.

Last month, a security guard sitting in the “Tikkun” exhibition hall told a reporter that he had not witnessed any expressions of outrage or protest through the first nine months of the exhibit. “When we opened we were afraid of negative reactions, but they’re not stressed about it,” he said of visitors. “We have shown worse things here.” The guard, who has worked at the museum since it opened in 2008, mentioned a 2010 exhibit, “Our Struggle: Responding to Mein Kampf,” which included a copy of Hitler’s autobiography. “Some people were cussing us out” for displaying the book, he recalled.

Meanwhile, on the same floor as “Tikkun,” there is another, smaller exhibit containing potentially offensive art. A sign outside of the room warns visitors that inside is a Hitler marionette created by the parents of puppeteer Frank Oz. “Our intention in displaying this object is to keep the memory of the Holocaust alive through the objects and firsthand stories of those who experienced its persecution, and to encourage conversation and education about the ongoing horrors of antisemitism and authoritarianism today,” the sign says.

Coerver, CJM’s executive director, said he was proud that the museum’s three current exhibits — “Tikkun,” “Oz is for Oznowicz: A Puppet Family’s History” and “Gillian Laub: Family Matters,” which includes photographs that Laub took of her Trump-supporting relatives — are raising “challenging questions” and providing opportunities for both visitors and museum staff to “expand our horizons.”

“We’ve been wading into some issues that I think are a little thicker than maybe we’ve been confronting in the past,” he said, “and I hope that continues.”

There’s lots to love about the Sunshine State, but we’re also notorious for the craziest crimes. One Florida city even ranked in the top 15 for highest murder rates in America. It’s not really a list we love to see Florida on, but we can’t say we’re not surprised with all the insane stuff that happens here.

Our friends at neighboorhoodscout.com ranked the top 30 cities in the country with the highest murder rates per 1,000 residents. They condensed their research by including cities with 25,000 or more people. They collected their data by the number of murders reported to the FBI to have occurred in each city, and the population of each city. The city population data comes straight from the US Bureau of the Census at the time of each analysis. For instance, the 2022 list population uses 2020 population figures. The 2021 list uses 2019 figures, and so forth.

There were 14 new cities making the list this year. “The newcomer on this list with the highest murder rate is Saginaw, MI. The number of murders in Saginaw more than doubled from the previous year.” Thankfully (and surprisingly) only one Florida city was ranked in the research.

The 35-year-old Lyle, a Mexican telenovela star, faces up to 15 years in prison at sentencing.

Outside the courtroom, Lyle's family shared their hope that his sentence will be as short as possible.

A jury earlier this month found Lyle guilty of manslaughter in the 2019 road rage incident that left 63-year-old Juan Ricardo Hernandez dead.

A security camera video showed Lyle rushing up to Hernandez and punching him in the face. Hernandez died after hitting his head on the pavement.

Defense attorneys argued that Hernandez started the incident when he got out of his car and pounded on the window of the car Lyle was riding in at an intersection.

The family of 63-year-old Juan Hernandez said they lost part of themselves three years ago, when he was dealt a fatal punch by Lyle during the road rage incident.

They also argued that Lyle was defending his family against what he thought was a threat posed by Hernandez.

But prosecutors said Hernandez had walked away and was heading back to his car before the punch. They also said that three witnesses testified that Hernandez had his hands up in a defensive posture and that there was no reason for Lyle to hit him at that point.

As of Dec. 1, the lawyers have collected more than $847,000 by investigating, safeguarding and liquidating Murdaugh’s assets. That number is expected to reach $1.3 million when the group sells a plot of land he owns in Beaufort County in the Williams Islands and cashes in his 401(k) retirement fund, but it could grow by even more, the lawyers' representative said in court.

Circuit Court Judge Daniel Hall approved a request from the legal teams, called the receivers, to take 30 percent of the $847,000 already collected as well as from selling the island and liquidating Murdaugh's retirement account.

The attorneys requested more than $374,000 in fees for their work.

""(These) fees are much less than the gains they have brought to the receivership estate,"" said Amy Hill, the lawyer representing the receivers.

The hearing lasted less than 20 minutes. No other parties were present and no opposing filings were submitted to the court, Hall said.

The team of receivers is led by Columbia trial lawyer John Lay and former U.S. Attorney for South Carolina Peter McCoy.

The money. which the receivers tracked down, was generated to compensate creditors and victims harmed during a decades-long blitz of fraud, theft and betrayal. Though substantial, it won’t come close to covering the millions Murdaugh is accused of plundering.

Hill pointed to the work Lay and McCoy did in issuing nearly 70 subpoenas to law firms, banks, attorneys and other individuals and then reviewing the thousands of financial records they received in response.

They say they put a stop to efforts by Murdaugh and his associates to shift the 54-year-old’s assets to relatives and preferred creditors. And they tout their negotiations with Murdaugh’s lawyers, business partners and banks to resolve complicated legal disputes over what remains of his properties and wealth.",Q4

APP-BASED DELIVERY WORKERS WOULD EARN $23.82 UNDER PROPOSED PAY RATE: A first-of-its-kind proposed minimum pay rate would boost the hourly earnings to $23.82 per hour for NYC’s more than 60,000 app-based restaurant delivery workers. Making the announcement today, NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) Commissioner Vilda Vera Mayuga indicated that the pay hike — if fully implemented, would consist of a $19.86 base rate, $2.26 to cover workers’ expenses, and $1.70 to reflect the absence of workers’ compensation insurance, because the apps consider the delivery persons to be independent contractors rather than employees.

The proposed rate, which would be finalized after a public hearing and consideration of public comments, would be $17.87 upon taking effect, and would increase to $23.82, adjusted for inflation, when it is fully phased-in on April 1, 2025, and must be paid to delivery workers based on trip time—time spent delivering—and on-call time—time spent connected to the app, waiting for a trip offer.

GROUPS DEMAND RELEASE OF GANG DATABASE REPORT: The Legal Aid Society, G.A.N.G.S Coalition, elected officials, impacted New Yorkers and others, rallied outside of the Office of the Inspector General for the NYPD to demand the release of a long-awaited report on the New York City Police Department’s (NYPD) controversial gang database. The groups called on the New York City Council to pass Int. 0360, pending legislation that would abolish the database and preclude the NYPD from creating a replacement.

Advocates have long decried the NYPD gang database as discriminatory, over-inclusive, and full of erroneous data that results in surveillance and the questionable prosecution of Black and Latinx people. Cities across the country, including Chicago, Boston, and Washington D.C., have successfully challenged their local law enforcement’s gang databases in court.

REMAINS OF BROOKLYN WWII SOLDIER FOUND 77 YEARS LATER: The remains of a Brooklyn man killed during World War II have finally been accounted for, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency has announced. U.S. Army Staff Sgt. James Rotunno, 27, had been assigned in 1945 to Company K, 3rd Battalion, 157th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Division. Rotunno was killed during a mission while his unit was engaged with German forces during the Battle of Reipertswiller in France, but his body could not be recovered at the time because of the fighting.

Staff Sgt. Rotunno was accounted for in September, but his family only recently received their full briefing on his identification.

SENTENCED IN ATTEMPTED ARSON OF NYPD VAN: United States District Judge Dora L. Irizarry in Brooklyn federal court today sentenced Samantha Shader to 72 months’ imprisonment for using an improvised incendiary device, commonly known as a “Molotov cocktail,” in an attempt to set fire to a New York City Police Department (NYPD) at a protest in Brooklyn. Ms. Shader, who pleaded guilty to the charge in April, was involved in the May 29, 2020 protest following the death of George Floyd while he was in police custody.

Defendant told a co-conspirator of her intention to “go down to the city to cause some hell” during protests following the murder of George Floyd. Last year, Floyd’s murderer, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, was convicted and is serving a 21-year-prison sentence.

The charges also include carjacking causing serious bodily injury.

The federal court convicted 37-year-old Fernando Angel Puga, aka “Cholo,” of Las Cruces, for one count of kidnapping; one count of carjacking resulting in serious bodily injury; and one count of transportation of a stolen vehicle in interstate commerce in May, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas.

The U.S. Attorney’s office reported:

According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, on June 9, 2017, Puga and his co-defendant Sergio Ivan Quinonez-Venegas, 38, from Mexico, approached a man working at a food truck in El Paso. Puga and Quinonez told the victim their car had broken down and asked for a ride. While the victim was giving the defendants a ride to a nearby gas station, Quinonez pulled out a gun and advised the victim that this “was a kidnapping.” The victim was forced at gunpoint and knifepoint to drive the pair from El Paso to Las Cruces. Once in Las Cruces, the victim was struck and stabbed multiple times by a machete wielded by Puga, fracutring the victim’s skull and severely puncturing his body and hands.

A New Mexico state court’s jury found Puga not guilty of the attempted murder of Border Patrol Agent Lorenzo Hernandez in April, 2019, Breitbart Texas reported. The jury also found him not guilty on the charge of aggravated assault.

However, Puga’s co-conspirator Sergio Ivan Venegas-Quiñonez, a Mexican national, pleaded guilty to the state charge of attempted murder and received a sentence of up to nine years in prison.

Earlier this year, Venegas-Quiñonez pleaded guilty to the carjacking charged and received a sentence of 60 months in prison in September, the U.S. Attorney’s Office stated.

“I am thankful that this violent criminal will have a long time behind bars to reflect on his heinous actions while the community is made safer,” U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas Ashley C. Hoff said in a written statement. “I am also hopeful that the victim experiences healing and finds some solace in defendant’s removal from society. I laud the efforts of our law enforcement partners who worked to bring Puga to justice.”

FBI Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey R. Downey, El Paso Field Office added, “When faced with a deadly situation, the victim fought off the attackers and managed to escape. The courage and determination showed by the victim is awe-inspiring. The victim was not only able to escape but also assist law enforcement in the identification and arrest of the defendant and bring about the justice deserved in this violent abduction.”",Q4
https://www.postbulletin.com/news/local/rochester-man-sentenced-to-over-6-years-for-drunk-driving-crash-into-rochester-home,Rochester man sentenced to over 6 years for drunk driving crash into Rochester home,"ROCHESTER — A 49-year-old Rochester man was sentenced to 75 months in prison in Olmsted County District Court for a May 2021 drunk driving crash into a Rochester home.

Marcus Antwan Martin, Sr. has been incarcerated at various Minnesota prison facilities throughout the years for different impaired driving charges in several different counties. Martin has at least eight convictions for driving under the influence in Minnesota.

ADVERTISEMENT

District Judge Kathy Wallace credited Martin with 481 days for time served and ordered five years of probation following his release. His expected release date is Oct. 20, 2030.

Martin pleaded guilty to one felony count driving while intoxicated as part of a plea deal that dismissed two other impaired driving charges.

According to the criminal complaint:

Martin crashed his vehicle through a chain link fence and into a Rochester house on the 600 block of 14-1/2 Street Southeast the night of May 6, 2021. The front end of his vehicle had pushed through the wall of the home and was protruding into the lower level.

When Rochester police officers arrived, they noted Martin appeared intoxicated. When officers tried to bring him to a sqaud car, Martin became upset and punched the police vehicle.

Law enforcement learned that Martin had gotten into a physical argument with his son just prior to the crash at Martin's Rochester residence. The son left the scene and Martin got into his car and followed him.

""Martin got out of the car, argued with (his son), and got back into the car. (His son) saw Martin drive away and crash into the house,"" reads part of the complaint.

Martin had a .135 blood alcohol concentration, according to a preliminary breath test. He was taking to Mayo Clinic Hospital-Saint Marys by ambulance for treatment.

At the time of his arrest, Martin was on supervised probation for three different DWI convictions and his license had previously been canceled as inimical to public safety.",Q4

https://www.algemeiner.com/2022/12/05/with-her-hamas-comment-whoopi-goldberg-makes-a-fool-of-herself-once-again/,"With Her Hamas Comment, Whoopi Goldberg Makes a Fool of Herself Once Again","In February, when ABC suspended Whoopi Goldberg after making moronic comments about the Holocaust, one might have thought she would try to at least sound informed. On “The View,” she had said that the Holocaust was not about race, revealing extreme ignorance and narcissism.

“Let’s be truthful about it because the Holocaust isn’t about race,” she claimed. “It’s not about race. It’s not about race. It’s about man’s inhumanity to man.”

Co-host Ana Navarro pointed out that it was about white supremacists going after Jews. Bizarrely, Goldberg said the Holocaust was about “white people killing white people … y’all go fight amongst yourselves.”

I guess Goldberg didn’t fare too well on the analogy parts of the SATs or in her history class in school. But it is surprising, with her being an actress, that she never heard that the Nazis believed that Jews were an inferior race, and didn’t even watch one of the countless documentaries or dramatic films that showed this.

Last week on “The View,” in a discussion about comparing the US, Israel, Hamas, and the Taliban as terrorist organizations, as Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar (D-MN) once did, Goldberg didn’t dispute Omar’s claim, but said it “depends on who you talk to.”

That’s strange considering that it’s been proven countless times that Hamas’ charter calls for Israel’s destruction and the murder of innocent Jews, and because the United States and almost every Western government lists Hamas as a terrorist group.

You can find people who say the Holocaust didn’t happen and the Earth is flat. The Ku Klux Klan doesn’t consider themselves a terrorist organization. Should Goldberg interview one of their members to get their point of view? I doubt she will.

Maybe the women of “The View” should do a taping in Iran and ask the Revolutionary Guard what their thoughts are. After all, as Goldberg so brilliantly said, “it depends on who you ask.”

The public has ignorance fatigue — along with a healthy dose of anti-Israel hatred — so this comment by Goldberg has gotten far less attention than her comment about the Holocaust.

There has been no call for her to apologize for her asinine comment about Hamas. Perhaps she should interview the family of Vyachesalev Golev, 23, who was murdered by two Hamas terrorists in May. Why doesn’t she ask for their perspective?

If you go by the “depends on who you ask” route, you can go down any conspiracy rabbit hole imaginable because there are plenty of people who believe absurd things. Do you want to find people who say America is a terrorist nation? Maybe you can find people who say the Taliban has always been peaceful. Instead of just saying a nonsense line, why don’t you back it up and have them on your show as well?

We have sunk so low that it is hard to tell when someone is speaking out of ignorance or malice. In addition, there is a motivation to say controversial things to get ratings. To her credit, co-host Joy Behar pointed out that the US lists Hamas as a terrorist group.

One can only hope that Goldberg will at some point care about truth. But I wouldn’t bet on it.

https://www.counterpunch.org/2022/12/30/because-polygamists-are-queer-people-too-goddammit/,"Because Polygamists Are Queer People Too, Goddammit","Nicky, why can’t you just smile and join the pride parade? I must hear this refrain at least ten times a day from people both inside and out of my community. With all the progress, with all the popular approval, why can’t I just be one of those happy Queers you see on TV? Why must I insist on being such a fucking bummer? And sometimes I wish it was that easy too. That I could just put on a pair of heels and embrace the simple pleasures of mainstream inclusion. The only problem is that I know way too much about the history of Western Civilization to pretend that progress isn’t a fucking trap.

I can’t pretend that the globalized corporate culture that defines the collective West isn’t a moral desert defined by commercialism, conformity and assimilation. I can’t pretend that this culture isn’t the direct descendant of the White Anglo-Saxon Puritan culture that wiped out the pagan tribes who once revered my people for what made us unique, and I can’t pretend that being Queer isn’t defined by our long history of resistance to this culture and that allowing ourselves to be absorbed into it would be tantamount to genocide.

Every right that these people have given us has been rigged. We have the right to state protection from bigotry as long as we consent to recognizing the authority of an institution that violates the rights of more Queer people than every Bible Belt fag basher combined in the form of the Prison Industrial Complex. We have the right to serve openly in the straight man’s army as long as we consent to the wholesale slaughter of other marginalized people that defines its very existence. And of course, there is the most sacred right that a Queer person could possibly ask for, what every little trans girl dreams about, the right to marriage.

This was the right on full display just a few weeks ago when Joe Biden officially signed the Respect for Marriage Act into law. A bipartisan smash hit, this law codified federal recognition of same sex marriage as well as interracial marriage after the Supreme Court reminded us all of the unpleasant fact that the Founding Fathers were a bunch of sexist bigots like them with the overturning of Roe V. Wade.

Once again, I can’t pretend to be impressed by this thing called marriage. I’m an anarchist for Stirner’s sake. The state’s approval of who I love and how I love them is about as meaningful to me as receiving the blessing of the Mafia. But I have nothing against the institution in and of itself and consenting adults should have every right to enjoy it. Kali knows the weird shit that turns me on isn’t every Queer’s cup of tea. But there was something that just wasn’t quite right about this picture.

The sight of all these shiny, happy, camera-friendly Queers whooping it up on the White House lawn as Cindy Lauper belted out the hits couldn’t erase the fact that many of the Beltway ghouls who invited them to the party, including our hero Joe Biden, had long and economically fruitful careers defined by fucking us over with sickeningly bigoted laws like DOMA and FOSTA-SESTA. I mean, after decades of drowning us in pigs’ blood, the cool kids invite us to a party in our honor and this doesn’t seem weird to you?

I know, I know, Nicky is such a fucking downer. I’ve heard. But I can’t seriously be the only faggot asking, ‘what’s the catch?’ here. The answer to this million-dollar question can actually be found in the fine print of the bill itself. The Respect for Marriage Act codifies any marriage between two people into federal law. It also explicitly forbids the recognition of polygamy in no uncertain terms. In other words, our marriage rights come at the expense of someone else’s.

Who cares about a bunch of dusty old Mormon bumpkins, right? Well, you should if you have any respect at all for the cultural institution of Queerness. After all, what is a Queer person? A sexual and/or gender minority whose existence runs against the grain of the Anglo-Saxon Puritan order. And what is a polygamist? Say it with me now, people- a sexual and/or gender minority whose existence runs against the grain of the Anglo-Saxon Puritan order. Polygamy is a form of polyamory, love between multiple partners, that is as Queer as any lifestyle you’re likely to find at your local fetish ball.

The fact that your average American polygamist is a Fundamentalist Mormon fag basher shouldn’t matter anymore than the fact that your average radical feminist lesbian thinks that I’m a male chauvinist pig for having a prick under my dress. They are still our people whether they realize it or not and we can’t pretend to support marriage equality while we throw other consenting adults under the state’s bus.

America has been at war with polygamy for as long as it’s been at war with every other form of Queer love and the Mormons have been savagely persecuted for generations for once daring to recognize it. In 1838, the governor of Missouri chased them from their original homeland on the threat of extermination in what can only be accurately described as an act of Queer ethnic cleansing. A few years later, their founder Joseph Smith was lynched by an angry mob in Illinois and the Mormons escaped the Midwest to the deserts of the Great Salt Lake in search of a safe space where they could simply exist in peace.

Polygamy was officially banned by the federal government with the Edmund’s Act in 1862. When a few brave Mormons challenged this law as a clear violation of their constitutional freedom of religion in 1878, the Supreme Court upheld the law in the Court’s first decision to limit religious freedom with reasoning that is sadly still sited to this day. This reasoning included the justices referring to the practice of plural marriage as “odious” and claims that it offends polite society that should sound strangely familiar to all ears. It seems that constitutional rights like religious liberty are only sacred when the people practicing them conform to the puritanical confines of our slave-raping Founding Fathers. Who knew?

The Mormons attempted to peacefully secede and established their own sovereign communities in what is now largely modern-day Utah, but the United States government just wouldn’t let them be. President Buchanan invaded the Deseret with 2,500 soldiers to put down the “Mormon Rebellion” and forcibly confiscate church land. This persecution only received a brief reprieve during the Civil War but Abraham Lincoln’s bloody suspension of Habeas Corpus to keep the Union whole made it violently clear that secession was another institution that the American government was willing to kill to suppress. In 1890, the Church of Latter-Day Saints finally bowed to pressure and traded one of the founding principles of their faith in exchange for the safety of mainstream inclusion.

But all this carnage was about much more than just one guy shacking up with two wives. Much like with all Queer rights, the government’s animus had a lot more to do with social cohesion than anything else. Early Mormon society was far from utopian, but it was defined by a form of pious collectivism that placed the community before the state and every straight man’s favorite fetish, capitalism.

Families were larger and more powerful than any one government institution and women and children generally enjoyed more independence than the lesser captives of most 19th century monogamous communities. Any degeneration from sexual and gender mores poses a direct challenge to the carefully constructed western class system that evolved out of the rise of patriarchy during the agricultural revolution. This is why Queer people of all kinds are only ever left with two choices, conformity or persecution.

The Church of Latter-Day Saints chose conformity and lost a society that was nearly entirely autonomous from the wickedness of the western world that now ravages the streets of Salt Lake City with crime and addiction. The Mormons who chose to embrace this assimilation embraced the federal government that killed their ancestors as a divinely inspired institution while the few who chose to resist were chased by this divine institution into the shadows where they could be easily poached by rapacious creeps like Warren Jeffs.

Polygamy remains a felony on the books in all fifty states. Refugees whose ancestors have practiced this form of family values since long before Joseph Smith wore short pants are denied citizenship and deported. Families continue to be forcefully separated and shattered by the federal government in routine raids on polygamist compounds. These people cling to their faith because everyone but God has forgotten them. Speaking as a genderfuck outcast who spent the better part of her childhood at the mercy of Catholic creeps not unlike Warren Jeffs, I can’t help but to believe that my community owes these people a little better than this. Hell, we owe it to ourselves too, because polygamists are Queer people too, goddammit and if we don’t look out for each other, no one will. Certainly not Joe Biden.

The problem with mainstream inclusion is that it always comes at the price of the persecution of those who wish to live their lives outside of the confines of mainstream society. State-sanctioned marriage comes with benefits that should belong to all of us by birthright, regardless of how many people we love or how we choose to love them. If Queer people abandon our rebellious principles for this conformist sacrament, it won’t just be at the expense of a bunch of forgotten pioneers, it will be at the expense of our own sacred identity as renegades against puritanical conformity. Call me a fucking bummer ten times a day, but I would rather die like an odious apostate than dance on their graves for a White House photo-op any day of the week.",Q4

https://tribune.com.pk/story/2388792/4-dead-in-quetta-suicide-blast-targeting-police,4 dead in Quetta suicide blast targeting police,"At least four people, including a policeman and a woman and her son, died while more than two dozen others sustained injuries in a powerful blast in Quetta’s Baleli area on Wednesday that targeted a police patrol, senior police officials said.

Deputy Inspector General of Police, Quetta, Azfar Mehesar said that a police truck, carrying policemen, was hit in the attack. He gave the death toll from the explosion at four. Mehesar added that one policeman died inside the police truck, while a woman and her son died in another vehicle, while on way to Quetta.

A senior security official said on the condition of anonymity that initial police investigation suggested it was a suicide attack. The suicide bomber rammed his explosive-laden vehicle into the police truck. There was a huge blast in which the police truck was destroyed, the official said.

The blast was heard far and wide and caused panic in the area. Police and rescue workers were quick to reach the spot. The injured were rushed to the Civil Hospital Quetta and the Combined Military Hospital (CMH), where an emergency was declared to provide prompt medical treatment to the injured.

Wasim Baig, spokesperson for the Balochistan Health Department, told AFP that a policeman, a civilian woman, and two children had been killed in the blast. “The injured include 21 policemen and two children,” Baig added. Some of the wounded were in a critical condition, police official Abdul Haq told Reuters.

Read: TTP calls off ceasefire, orders terrorist attacks across Pakistan

The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack. In a statement, the TTP said that its fighter detonated a car bomb near a customs post to avenge the killing of its founding member Umar Khalid Khurasani, according to AFP.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack and directed for the best possible medical aid to the injured. He also paid tribute to the martyred police official. Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah also condemned the suicide attack.

Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Quddus Bizenjo strongly condemned the blast and directed the administration to submit a report about the blast. In a statement issued after the blast, Bizenjo said the perpetrators of the blast would be brought to justice. An important meeting was also held at the Balochistan home ministry.

The attack came two days after the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) announced the end of a ceasefire the banned outfit had agreed with the federal government in June this year. The group said on Monday it had ordered its militants to stage terrorist attacks across the country.

The government and the TTP had agreed to a truce earlier this year after Afghanistan’s new Taliban rulers took a prominent role in brokering peace talks, but negotiations made little progress and there were frequent breaches.

Also on Monday, the government launched a week-long polio immunisation campaign aiming to inoculate over 13 million children. Polio vaccination teams are routinely escorted by police, and the TTP has regularly ambushed officers in remote restive areas.

After his car had become stuck on the side of a dark mountain road, Glass — who appeared to be experiencing a mental health crisis — was too scared to exit his vehicle after seven responding officers from several different law enforcement departments arrived and was not compliant with orders to unlock his doors.

Though Glass had not committed any crime, the decision was made by officers at the scene to break his passenger seat window to remove him. At which point, Glass, an amateur geologist, brandished a short rock knife at officers and cut himself with it. Officers fired beanbags and then bullets at Glass, killing him.

An attorney for the Glass family, Siddhartha Rathod, previously told Insider that deputy Buen was the first to arrive at the scene and repeatedly escalated the encounter with Christian, ultimately firing the fatal shots that killed him.

Experts who analyzed the body camera footage released by the family told Insider a better course of action would have been to leave Glass alone after he refused help, rather than make the decision to break into his vehicle or shoot him.

An internal investigation into the incident is ongoing at the Clear Creek County Sheriff's Department, according to a statement by the department that acknowledged ""there were policy and procedural failures"" by responding officers.

""Nothing will bring Christian back to his family,"" read a statement the Glass family's lawyers emailed to Insider. ""Simon and Sally Glass are relieved appropriate charges have been brought against some of those responsible for the murder of their son. However, justice for Christian will require all those involved being held accountable. Christian's death is a stain on every officer who was present and failed to prevent the escalation and unnecessary uses of force.""

Sheriff Rick Albers and representatives for the Clear Creek County Sheriff's Department did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

No property was damaged, no one was injured and neither squeegee worker was charged in the incident, according to a police report. But U.S. District Court Judge James K. Bredar’s run-in with squeegee workers, and the ensuing police response, has renewed focus on squeegeeing and raised questions about the necessity of having law enforcement respond to certain situations.

“The fact of the matter is not every challenge should be met with policing and prosecution,” said Dave Jaros, who heads the University of Baltimore School of Law’s Center for Criminal Justice Reform.

Bredar and his wife were stopped Sunday afternoon at the intersection of North Avenue and Mount Royal Terrace when two squeegee workers approached their SUV and offered to clean the windshields, according to a police report. Bredar and his wife refused them, and the pair became hostile, with one of them giving the middle finger to Bredar’s wife, the report said.

Bredar, who was a passenger in the SUV, took a photo of that man, age 20, who then proceeded to spit on the car, the judge later told police. Bredar, who is white, reported that the other worker used his squeegee to spell out the word “racist” on the SUV windows.

After the couple drove off, Bredar called Baltimore Police, asking the department to send officers to the intersection. Once there, the worker who apparently gave the middle finger spoke with officers who gave him a warning and told him to stop squeegeeing at that intersection.

Judge James K. Bredar presides over the enforcement of Baltimore’s consent decree, which is designed to give the city a stronger police department that fights crime while it serves and protects the civil and constitutional rights of residents.

Only one of the workers was named in the police report.

Neither Bredar nor the named worker returned calls and texts seeking interviews. A spokesperson for the U.S. District Court in Maryland confirmed that Bredar called the police but offered no comments. The Baltimore Banner, an online news site, originally reported the interaction.

After this summer’s fatal shooting at an intersection in the Inner Harbor reignited the debate about whether squeegeeing should be allowed, Baltimore State’s Attorney-to-be Ivan Bates said he would have police get the workers off the intersections and into court-ordered diversionary programs meant to connect them with social services and vocational training. Activists feared Bates’ plan marked the possible return to a “clear the corners” style of enforcement that plagued Baltimore for years, culminating in the police department having to reach a consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice because of its unconstitutional policing of poor, Black neighborhoods.

Bredar, who presides over enforcement of the decree, addressed squeegeeing in the context of the decree in August, saying it did not prohibit “vigorous enforcement” meant to curtail such workers.

“Generally speaking, city leaders will decide whether enforcement action should be taken with respect to the squeegee issue,” he said, adding that “the terms of the consent decree will regulate how that enforcement action is carried out.”

While Bredar didn’t weigh in directly on what he thought the city should be doing about squeegee workers, his decision to call police Sunday indicates he thinks law enforcement should play a role, activists said.

“The judge has clearly shown that he is not a neutral party and believes that the solution to the challenges our city faces are solved by calling the police on Black men and boys — the key issue that forced the consent decree to exist,” said DeRay Mckesson, founder of the nonprofit Campaign Zero, which works to eliminate police violence.

Mckesson called for Bredar to be removed from oversight of the consent decree, saying he “no longer has legitimacy.”

Mayor Brandon Scott earlier this summer formed the “squeegee collaborative,” a group of local business, nonprofit and youth leaders and elected officials who are working to develop solutions to the squeegee issue. The group has met several times and will announce its strategy “in the coming weeks,” said Monica Lewis, a spokeswoman for Scott.

“Any enforcement strategy must strike a balance between the rights of all individuals soliciting and the government’s interest in public safety,” Lewis said Tuesday.

The Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 this week pointed to the incident involving Bredar as another example of city residents feeling unsafe.

“Judge Bredar, why do you travel through that intersection? You should go around it like most of us do every day. Glad you and your wife were unhurt,” the FOP posted on Twitter.

Sgt. Mike Mancuso, the union president, did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Leaders of the police officers union have complained that the department’s leadership is focused on the consent decree and not enough on reducing crime, and that officers feel discouraged from engaging in proactive policing measures.

A mainstay of major city intersections for decades, Baltimore’s squeegee workers are typically young, Black individuals experiencing severe poverty. Many see it as the best way to provide for their basic needs.

The squeegee debate reached a fever pitch this summer when Timothy Reynolds, a white, 48-year-old resident of Hampden in North Baltimore, got out of his car with a bat and confronted a group of Black workers at the Inner Harbor intersection of Light and Conway streets. The altercation ended with one of the workers shooting and killing Reynolds. One of the workers, who turned 15 the next day, is charged with first-degree murder; his attorneys have said he acted in self-defense.

Many drivers and downtown business owners consider the workers a nuisance and a handful have described fearful interactions resulting in vehicle damage or being tricked out of thousands of dollars. But such negative interactions are the minority, with thousands of drivers passing each day without incident.

Defense attorney Warren Brown, who is representing the teenager charged with murder in Reynolds’ death in July, said he understands how the workers’ presence can make many motorists, especially white ones, feel nervous, especially when they’re aggressively seeking tips.

“People understandably feel hostage when caught at the light and are swarmed by squeegee kids,” he said. “They’d probably feel less threatened if these kids were dressed in their blue blazers and striped ties.”

Brown, who is Black, said he sometimes avoids squeegee intersections because constantly tipping can be a hassle. However, he said he is disheartened when he is out in Baltimore County, where he lives, and hears people say part of the reason they avoid coming into the city is the workers.

“They view squeegeeing as an extension of crime,” Brown said.

Jaros, the law professor, said he understands why people might be inclined to call police when confronted by workers in a tense situation, but using police to address quality-of-life issues has failed across the country and actively contributes to the mass incarceration of poor people and people of color.

“We need to have the humility to recognize the criminal justice system is a blunt tool and its use can be counterproductive,” Jaros said.

Bredar himself said in April 2021 that people have “unrealistically expected” police to provide almost every essential social service that residents require, while also acknowledging a better alternative is not in place.

“The consent decree recognizes that it is inappropriate for the police department to try to function as an uber-social services agency, and the city is required to reconsider how it meets critical needs, especially in the area of behavioral health,” he said then.",Q4
https://atlantablackstar.com/2022/12/15/man-beaten-dragged-in-handcuffed-settles-lawsuit-for-130k/,"(VIDEO)’These Injuries Are Going to be Long-Lasting’: Black Man Beaten, Dragged While Handcuffed Settles Excessive Force Lawsuit with Miami Beach for $130K","A Black North Carolina man whose trip to Miami Beach turned into a ride to jail has settled an excessive force lawsuit for $130,000 with the city after he was seen on video violently arrested, beaten unconscious and dragged across the street by police in 2019.

“Why would it take multiple officers to have to seize him, tackle him, and start applying excessive force with punches, closed fists, etcetera and the words they used on the bodycam, just hyper-aggressive,” said Jordan Redavid, the attorney representing 29-year-old Cody Wade in the newly settled lawsuit that was filed in July 2021.

Wade was vacationing in the South Florida area from Charlotte on the day of his encounter with Miami Beach police. On the evening of June 29, 2019, Wade was inside the nightclub Mango Tropical Café, when “an incident occurred,” as the Miami Herald reported, that was later described as “disorderly behavior,” resulting in Wade being kicked out of the establishment.

“What led to them asking him to leave is disputed, but what isn’t disputed is what’s captured on the video. Even after he was asked to leave, he didn’t cause a scene, there was no threats of violence, he didn’t bother other customers,” Redavid said of Wade’s ejection from the restaurant.

“The video shows him very calmly still communicating with an employee of the business. The employee of the business gestures, almost to give directions, he leaves and comes back within a few minutes. He doesn’t do anything different other than re-asks it looks like the same question, he’s directed to leave, and he does,” Redavid added, describing what led to Wade’s run-in with Miami Beach police.

Body camera video shows Miami Beach Police Officers Alfredo Garcia and Agustin Rodriguez speaking with Wade for several minutes asking him to leave the area outside of the establishment in what began as a calm exchange of words that grew more intense as officers are heard using several profanities.

The officers accused Wade of being intoxicated. “You’re a little drunk,” one officer said. Another officer asked Wade, “why do you smell like weed?”

Wade denied being intoxicated or on any drugs and suggested he receive a breathalyzer test; however, none were given on bodycam. As they continued talking, the officers appear increasingly agitated as Wade prepared to leave.

In what appears to be a jump cut in the body camera video from the calm scene in front of the Mango Tropical Café to the next scene, Garcia and Rodriguez are shown walking toward an intersection where they encounter Wade again, this time running through the crosswalk.

Wade’s attorney didn’t explain why the 29-year-old was running, but a police report claims Wade tried to reenter Mango Tropical Café and he was “running to try to evade the officers as they sought to arrest him for trespassing,” the Herald said.

“He starts crossing the street in a crosswalk, and that’s when the police intercept him,” Redavid said in his description of how the encounter turned physical.

Cody Wade seen on bodycam video handcuffed and unconscious after violent arrest.

As Wade dashed, he bumps into the officers, which is captured on body camera video. The moment Wade and the officers collided the officers are seen tackling Wade to the ground to make an arrest. While Wade was being handcuffed, officer Garcia is seen delivering five punches into Wade’s body, although exactly where on his body is not clear based on the unstable body camera video capturing the action.

“This looks like because the bodycam is very close, but closed fist punches, multiple strikes, the type of vulgar language that suggests a brawl as opposed to some orderly process of the law,” Redavid said.

After being punched several times and arrested, Wade’s body appeared limp. Meanwhile, one of the officers is heard saying, “get up, or we’re going to drag you across the street.”

The officers follow through with their threat of dragging an unconscious Wade across the street while still handcuffed with his hands behind his back. In the lawsuit filed, it says Wade was left lying unconscious on the curb of the street for “several minutes,” while the Herald explicitly indicates Wade was unconscious in the street for 12 minutes until paramedics arrived.

“At one point, there’s a loss of consciousness and in this case, I wouldn’t say it was undisputed, but I think objectively looking at the facts including the video, that would be undisputed,” Redavid said.

After paramedics arrived, Wade was taken to the hospital and given Narcan, a medicine used to reverse the effects of a drug overdose, although Wade denied using drugs according to a deposition filed in court the Herald reported.

Wade was charged with resisting an officer with violence, a felony in Florida, resisting an officer without violence, and trespassing property after warning, both classified as misdemeanors. The felony charge was later dropped, and the misdemeanor charges were not pursued by prosecutors, according to court records.

“I often think about, what if there wasn’t [surveillance video] and all you were left with is the body camera that the police officers turn on when they decide to turn it on. Yes, that would have captured the force, but it wouldn’t have told the story of why they used it,” Redavid said of the importance of video in Wade’s case against police.

Redavid says Wade suffered injuries from the incident he is still dealing with currently, although he declined to reveal his client’s medical records in details.

“These injuries are going to be long-lasting, if not permanent,” Redavid said of Wade’s health.

The excessive force lawsuit also accused other officers of failing to intervene and alleges the Miami Beach Police Department has a “history of widespread abuse…of its officers’ extreme and reckless actions against the citizens and visitors of the City of Miami Beach.”

The lawsuit also called for more training for Miami Beach Police officers.

Excessive force lawsuit in the U.S. District Court Southern District of Florida Miami Division.

“When you see a lawsuit with not just the individual officers but also the agency they work for, often times you can safely assume, there’s some public records that reveal a pattern of course of conduct,” Redavid said.

The city of Miami Beach approved to settle Wade’s lawsuit during its Sept. 28 commission meeting.

Miami Beach police has other ongoing pending lawsuits accusing the department of excessive force including the July 2021 arrests of Dalonta Crudup and Khalid Vaughn. While Crudup was handcuffed, “officers kicked him and slammed his head against the ground,” Axios reported.

Vaughn was captured on body camera video recording Crudup’s assault by officers. It led to other Miami Beach police officers on scene to approaching and attacking him in a violent arrest. A third person was also arrested during this incident for recording police arresting Vaughn, the Axios report added.

The incident involving Crudup and Vaughn drew outrage among many in the local Black community. The Miami-Dade branch of the NAACP said in a statement, “We are angered that the beating of a man in custody and the beating of an innocent bystander.”

The civil rights group also added, “for the last two years, we have seen multiple incidents of improper treatment of Black tourists, and this most recent example reinforces the [same] terrible message, that Black people are not welcome on Miami Beach.”

The five Miami Beach police officers involved in Crudup and Vaughn’s violent arrests were later charged with battery. “If [any] of us would have done such an atrocity, you would have already seen our mugshot and seen us being walked away in handcuffs. We would be charged with more than a misdemeanor,” said executive director of the Circle of Brotherhood Lyle Muhammad during a press conference about the arrests.

Former Miami Beach police Sgt. Jose Perez, was the first of the five officers involved in Crudup’s arrest to close his case in July 2022. He accepted a plea deal and received six months’ probation.

“Under the plea deal, Sgt. Jose Perez will not serve a prison sentence. Prosecutors lowered the battery charge from a felony to a misdemeanor – and the conviction will not appear on his record,” Local Today reported.

Miami Beach also has another pending excessive force lawsuit on its hands stemming from a different arrest of a New York woman in July 2021. NBC Miami reports, Mariyah Maple claimed to be hit with an officer’s bicycle then the officer pepper-sprayed her because she was recording a traffic stop on her cellphone.

Redavid says the Miami Beach Police Department is not doing enough to root out behaviors that leads to excessive force.

“In our opinion, the administrative part of the agencies, coming down with appropriate remedies, including but not limited to extended leave, sometimes maybe termination, sometimes courses to correct the behavior, I don’t think we see adequate sanctions coming internally,” Redavid said.

Atlanta Black Star raised questions with the Miami Beach Police Department and the city on continued excessive force cases, the impact it is having on Black communities and costs for taxpayers. While a spokesperson with Miami Beach said she is working on our requests for answers, the police department did not respond to our inquiries.

“I don’t think anybody with a straight face can say that a monetary settlement is justice. It’s just simply the best version of justice our legal system could afford under these particular facts and for what was in Cody’s best interest. Is he satisfied with the outcome understanding what’s in reason that the law can offer him civilly, yes,” Redavid said of the excessive force lawsuit settlement.

Although Wade was not available to be interviewed directly, Redavid says he is in good spirits following the settlement.

“Mr. Wade is doing well considering the circumstances,” Redavid said.",Q4

Head was “the muscle” when a group of men robbed a drug dealer in Daytona Beach two years ago, according to a prosecutor.

But the robbery turned into a murder when one of Head’s accomplices shot the drug dealer’s girlfriend on Sept. 18, 2020.

Head, 23, is on trial before Circuit Judge Leah Case at the S. James Foxman Justice Center in Daytona Beach. A panel of 14 jurors, including two alternates, began hearing testimony in the trial on Tuesday.

The 18-year-old victim, Rachael Gasparini, was Kevin Berry's girlfriend; the pair lived together at the Eagle Point Apartments, 468 Brentwood Drive in Daytona Beach.

Head was charged with first-degree felony murder and robbery with a firearm. He was charged as a principal in Gasparini’s killing because he is accused of participating in the crime, although he did not pull the trigger.

Assistant State Attorney Andrew Urbanak, who is prosecuting the case along with Assistant State Attorney Boone Forkner, said in his opening statement on Tuesday that Head was ""the muscle."" Armonta Waters was the “set-up” guy who arranged to make the marijuana purchase from Berry, Urbanak said.

Jordan Graham was the triggerman and fired the gun that killed Gasparini, according to Urbanak.

Kimba Kimble was the getaway driver, Urbanak said.

Like Head, Waters, 22, and Graham, 20, have been indicted on charges of first-degree murder and robbery with a firearm. The three face mandatory life in prison if convicted.

Head and Waters are from Valdosta, Georgia, while Graham is from Hahira, Georgia, according to charging affidavits.

Kimble, 23, of Daytona Beach, was charged with third-degree felony murder with a firearm. Kimble did not enter the apartment; he remained in the car, according to Urbanak.

The four men are being held at the Volusia County Branch Jail.

Only Head is on trial this week. The cases against the others remain open.

Under questioning by Urbanak, Berry testified that he had been in a romantic relationship with Gasparini and had been living with her for two years.

A few days before the shooting, Waters had texted Berry about buying some marijuana.

Berry testified that he had about $2,000 to $3,000 worth of marijuana in the apartment. He said on the day of the shooting, he walked outside the couple's ground floor apartment to get an “exotic pack” – which he described as a small package of marijuana with little designs on the packs and a street value of $750 – from his car.

Once Berry walked back to the apartment, he waved the men inside. He said he was in the dining room showing them the exotic pack when Waters asked to use the bathroom.

'Put him to sleep'

Berry testified that Head then grabbed him. Berry said he yelled at Gasparini to get his gun, an AR-15, from the bedroom.

Berry said he fought with Head who put him in a choke hold. He said he managed to get out of the choke hold but Head kept hitting him.

Berry said he asked Gasparini to get his gun before he knew the men were armed.

Berry also testified that he saw Graham pointing a gun at him. Berry testified that he “possibly” saw Graham pull the trigger.

“I seen him pointing it, but he also pulled it back like it was on safety or he was trying to cock it,” Berry said.

Berry said he was still struggling with Head when he heard Graham tell Head to “put him to sleep.""

Berry said that on the street that meant to kill him.

Berry testified that Gasparini ran out of the bedroom, but she did not have his rifle.

“I was still tussling with Jaquez at the time,” Berry said. “I heard her run out of the room. She screamed and that’s when I heard the gunshots.”

Berry said he was pleading with the men and saying he wanted to check on Gasparini. He said he told the men to take what they wanted.

Berry testified he didn’t think Gasparini had been shot because she was still talking. Berry said he grabbed his AR-15 from the master bedroom, ran outside and spotted one of the men getting into the car.

Berry said he shot at the car multiple times, several bullets hitting the driver’s side door.

But none of the men inside were hit.

Urbanak played a police body camera video for the jury of an officer arriving at apartment. The video showed some neighbors who had heard the commotion trying to help Gaspirini.

She was on her back on the floor moving her head some from side to side. The video had no sound. She died later that day.

Not yelling to shoot her?

During cross-examination, Head’s defense attorney, Philip Massa, referred to Berry dealing drugs. Berry responded he no longer dealt drugs and instead works as an electrician.

Massa asked Berry whether police had charged him with any crime.

Berry said he had not been charged.

“No one was expecting anyone to get shot that day?” Massa asked.

“No,” Berry replied.

“Objection; calls for speculation,” Urbanak said.

“Sustained,” Case said.

Berry said he received the AR-15 as a birthday present.

Berry said he was in a separate room fighting with Head at the time of the shooting.

“He’s not participating in the shooting at all, is he?” Massa asked Berry about Head.

“No, sir,” Berry replied.

“He’s not yelling to Graham ‘Shoot her, shoot her,’ is he?” Massa asked.

“No,” Berry said.

“He's not encouraging Graham to shoot her, is he?” Massa said.

“No,” Berry said.

Agbi, who pleaded guilty in May, expressed remorse.

Coldsmith lost her only child, but she was not alone in the courtroom. Members of Surviving Our Ultimate Loss surrounded her. But unlike her, most of them have never been able to see the dealer – the person who sold their child the fatal dose of fentanyl – in a courtroom.

WOBURN, MA — Former Woburn police officer John Donnelly was involved with extremist groups, which ultimately lead to involvement with the deadly “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Va. in 2017, city officials said on Friday, citing an internal investigation.



Woburn Mayor Scott Galvin announced the news alongside Police Chief Robert Rufo Jr. just over a week after saying police had begun an investigation into alleged ties between Donnelly and white supremacist groups. Officials vowed to complete an internal investigation. That investigation, they said on Friday, has since sustained a number of allegations against Donnelly.

Rufo and Galvin said they will submit the results of the investigation to the state Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission with the recommendation that Donnelly be decertified under the regulatory body’s authority. Donnelly, who resigned from the Woburn Police on Monday, would be barred from working as a police officer in Massachusetts if he is decertified.

READ: Woburn Cop Resigns Amid Investigation Into Charlottesville Rally Ties Writing on Friday, officials said the investigation into Donnelly revealed that he went under the alias of “Johnny O’Malley” in person and online.

The investigation showed Donnelly did in fact “attend, help plan and provide security for leadership of the Charlottesville event,” according to officials. He associated with the group Identity Evropa, which has been described by the Anti-Defamation Leauge as a white supremacist group, as noted in the statement from Rufo and Galvin on Friday.

Officials said Donnelly used “racist and antisemitic language” and was seen in photographs and video recordings providing security in Charlottesville for white nationalist leader Richard Spencer, who was a prominent figure at the Charlottesville rally. Events in Charlottesville initially came in response to plans to remove a local Confederate statue. Several people were then injured in clashes between white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups and counter protestors. One person died and still more were injured when a man rammed his car into a crowd of counter protesters. Two state troopers died when the helicopter they were using to monitor events crashed. Allegations against Donnelly surfaced last week hours before HuffPost published a lengthy investigation into Donnelly and his links to various extremist groups. Woburn officials put Donnelly on paid-administrative leave and announced an investigation into his conduct before Donnelly submitted his resignation earlier this week.

Officials said on Friday that Donnelly refused to be interviewed as part of the investigation into him. Ultimately, officials said, Donnelly was found to have violated “a number of Woburn Police Department rules and regulations including policies governing membership in organizations, outside employment, conduct unbecoming an officer and improper associations, as well as violations of the Woburn Police Department social media policy.” While his police investigation is now complete, Donnelly is also under review by the Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office, which is looking into all local cases linked to him over his law enforcement career to identify possible exculpatory evidence that should be passed along to defense attorneys. District Attorney Marian Ryan announced her office’s review on Friday of last week. She then convened an emergency meeting of her office’s Anti-Hate Anti-Bias Task Force on Thursday of this week.

While the event focused on a larger trend of white supremacist and neo-Nazi sympathizers entering law enforcement agencies, Ryan said prosecutors with her office have been in touch with defense attorneys regarding cases involving Donnelly. She said Donnelly’s name has additionally been added to a list that her office maintains of officers that potentially represent exculpatory evidence in various cases. Ryan said officials are moving carefully with their review with a focus on fairness. “To do that right takes time,” she said. “We don’t want to miss anything.” As the district attorney’s review progresses, and as the Woburn Police Department’s internal investigation report now heads to state oversight officials, representatives of the Committee for Public Counsel Services on Tuesday said in a letter that they will work to dismiss every case linked to Donnelly, according to WBUR and MassLive. The news agencies reported the story on Wednesday, with WBUR sharing a copy of the letter, which the Committee for Public Counsel Services sent to Rufo.

The committee represents public defenders in Massachusetts. In the letter, as shared by WBUR, lawyers said media reports beginning last week regarding Donnelly “caused a wave of disgust” among local public defenders. The committee requested a batch of records from the Woburn Police Department that they said will help in upcoming efforts and proceedings. Woburn officials have responded to allegations against Donnelly in recent days. ""There is no place for hate in Woburn or in the ranks of the Woburn Police Department,"" Galvin said on Monday after Donnelly resigned.",Q4
https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/11/05/plastic-pfas-chemical-health-dangers/,States take on PFAS ‘forever chemicals’ with bans and lawsuits,"“Forever chemicals” are everywhere. The thousands of chemicals in the group known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are found in cookware, packaging, cosmetics, clothing, carpet, electronics, firefighting foam and many other products. The chemicals don’t naturally break down and are so widespread that they’re found in the blood of 97 percent of Americans. Some PFAS compounds may decrease fertility, cause metabolic disorders, damage the immune system and increase the risk of cancer.

As they wait for regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency, some states have banned the use of PFAS in certain consumer products. Others have issued stronger water quality standards or empowered state agencies to speed up regulations. Many are pursuing cleanup and remediation efforts, with states suing polluters for compensation ranging from tens of millions to nearly a billion dollars.

Safer States, an alliance of environmental health groups focused on toxic chemicals, has tracked 203 recent bills in 31 states related to PFAS issues.

“I have heard from legislators that testing has been a driving force for them,” said Mara Herman, environmental health manager with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “It’s being found in so many places, it’s not really an urban issue or a rural issue.”

But advocates want federal action to hold multinational companies accountable for past contamination, clean infected waterways and impose sweeping bans on PFAS in new products.

“State by state is just absolutely ridiculous,” said Laurene Allen, co-founder of Merrimack Citizens for Clean Water, a New Hampshire group that has pushed the state to act on PFAS. “The progress you have shouldn’t be determined by your Zip code.”

The EPA has proposed a rule to regulate two common PFAS chemicals under the Superfund law.

Industry advocates, meanwhile, are lobbying on the federal level and in statehouses, arguing that attempts to regulate PFAS broadly could end up banning harmless chemicals that are crucial for important products and industries.

PFAS compounds were long seen as a chemistry “miracle” due to properties that made them nonstick, stain-repellent, waterproof or fire-resistant.

“The most problematic pieces of legislation include inappropriate and overly broad definitions of PFAS that pull in many potentially unintended substances and products,” the American Chemistry Council, a trade association, said in a statement sent by Tom Flanagin, senior director of product communications.

Flanagin’s email cited a category of fluoropolymers used in renewable energy, health care, electronics and other industries as critical to many products while carrying a low safety risk.

PFAS bans

Lawmakers in several states point to Maine’s 2021 passage of a law banning PFAS in all new products as a landmark moment. The measure, which will take effect in 2030, bans any intentionally added PFAS, but allows for exceptions in products that are essential for health, safety or the functioning of society and don’t yet have a PFAS-free alternative.

Many other states have enacted laws targeting PFAS in food packaging, cosmetics, firefighting foam or textiles. Colorado, for example, passed a law this year covering many products, while also ending its use in oil and gas production.

Colorado state Rep. Mary Bradfield, a Republican who co-sponsored the bill, said other lawmakers wanted to pursue an economywide ban as broad as Maine’s, but she said she thought the targeted approach — which includes carpets and rugs, food packaging and children’s products — was more achievable.

In Hawaii, legislators passed a ban on PFAS in food packaging and firefighting foam this year. And California passed laws this year to ban PFAS in cosmetics and textiles, while requiring companies to report data on other products containing PFAS.

In some states, agency officials have led the response to PFAS contamination. In Michigan, for example, regulators crafted rules over the past several years for levels of some PFAS compounds in drinking water, groundwater and surface water. The state also brought together seven state agencies to form the Michigan PFAS Action Response Team, known as MPART, which serves as a coordinating group for testing, cleanup and public education efforts. The state has conducted extensive testing to identify contaminated sites.

“If we've got a source [of contamination], we're going to find it in groundwater, so that's the easiest way to define and start those compliance actions,” said Abigail Hendershott, MPART’s executive director.

Now that it has a better handle on testing and regulating water, the state may turn its attention to consumer products, she said.

Cleaning up

Banning products and setting regulations may help prevent future contamination. But states still have much work ahead to address the forever chemicals found in their water, soil and residents.

This year, Florida legislators passed a bill requiring the state Department of Environmental Protection to establish rules by 2025 for target cleanup levels of PFAS if the EPA has not set a national standard by then.

“There will be state, federal and local funding that will need to come into play to address the problem,” said state Rep. Toby Overdorf, a Republican who co-sponsored the bill. “We are going to be educating municipalities and letting them know they need to develop a plan to get a hold of this so they can deliver clean drinking water.”

New Hampshire set aside $25 million this year to bolster a loan fund for PFAS remediation of public water systems and wastewater facilities. And lawmakers in Vermont gave residents the right to sue chemical companies for medical monitoring costs if they’ve been exposed to PFAS.

Meanwhile, 15 state attorneys general separately have sued companies alleged to be responsible for PFAS contamination, seeking damages for the harm caused by the pollution. Minnesota settled with 3M, which produced nonstick chemicals that polluted groundwater in the Twin Cities area, for $850 million in 2018. Delaware also reached a settlement, but the other lawsuits are still ongoing.

But some industry leaders think it’s unfair to hold PFAS manufacturers accountable for every instance of contamination.

“It’s not the person who manufactured it who caused the spill or leak, it’s the person on whose property the leak occurred,” said Scott Manley, executive vice president of Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, a pro-business lobbying association.

The group opposes a lawsuit brought by Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul, both Democrats, seeking nearly $1 billion from 18 companies state leaders say failed to protect the public.

Manley noted that his group has supported efforts to create a grant funding program to help local governments deal with PFAS hot spots.

But in some states, leaders would rather see polluters than taxpayers pay for cleanup.

“These chemicals are very difficult to clean up, and it's very expensive,” said Minnesota state Rep. Ami Wazlawik, a Democrat who sponsored a bill that banned PFAS in food packaging. “The taxpayers of Minnesota are not responsible for putting these chemicals there.”",Q4

“My blue family is way too important to continue to sit idly by and watch them be scrutinized, disrespected and murdered. It is time to start celebrating heroes and stop victimizing felons,” Oberheim said during her husband's funeral in May 2021.

That call to action was captured on a video that was shared Wednesday morning with those who attended the 10th annual Mount Zion Community Prayer Breakfast at the Mount Zion Convention Center.

Oberheim, the president and founder of Peacemaker Project 703, was the featured speaker at the event hosted by the Mount Zion Chamber of Commerce.

The Peacemaker Project 703 was created after Champaign police officer Chris Oberheim was fatally shot May 19, 2021, while responding to a domestic disturbance at a Champaign apartment complex.

Chris Oberheim was a Decatur native and was a member of the city's police force before taking a job in Champaign. His brother continues to serve in the Decatur department.

“I’ve heard her speak before and it’s always meaningful, but it’s probably more meaningful today than before,” said Decatur Mayor Julie Moore Wolfe, a Mattoon native. “Her message is very powerful.”

Moore Wolfe's slight change in perspective follows an Oct. 12 officer-involved shooting in Decatur that left two officers wounded and the suspect, Jamontey O. Neal, 32, dead.

Moore Wolfe’s son, Macon County Sheriff's Deputy Travis Wolfe, was among the officers involved in the Decatur shootout. He was unhurt, a status he shared with his mother via phone soon after the incident.

Also in the audience was Mandy Moore, who brought students from the Mount Zion Illinois CEO, an entrepreneurship program for junior and senior high schoolers.

“They learned the value of community and turning adversity into solutions,” Moore said.

Moore said she understands the students have their own struggles in life. “And God will meet us there,” she said. “We have to rely on our faith.”

Christian County Sheriff Bruce Kettlekamp greeted Oberheim with a hug after the breakfast.

“I want to support her because she is so supportive of law enforcement,” he said. “We appreciate all that she does.”

Peacemaker Project 703 provides support for law enforcement officers and their families through community outreach, reform and education. The number, 703, was Chris Oberheim's badge number.

For Oberheim, the support and strength runs deep through law enforcement and her faith. Oberheim said she finds strength each time she views the video of her eulogy for her husband.

“I woke up that morning and told the girls, today is going to be an epic day,” she said, recalling the day of the funeral after her presentation. “I had energy and felt good.”

Oberheim gave God the credit for her positive outlook. “We played party tunes in the car on the way over to the funeral home because we know that’s what Chris would have wanted,” she said.

The pain suffered through the weeks that followed the shooting was channeled into positive intentions, Oberheim said.

“We’re making a purpose out of pain,” she said. “Some of the most powerful moments in my life have come after losing my husband.”

Even the creation of Peacemaker Project 703 was an afterthought, prompted by the negative reaction to the image of her husband's killer, who was shot to death by a second Champaign police officer who responded to the call with Oberheim, shown on a local television station with angel wings and a halo.

Oberheim said social media posts encouraged businesses to pull their advertising from the station and instead put it toward a Go Fund Me account created for the Oberheim family. The family, in turn, decided to use the money to advance the call to action she made during the funeral.

“That’s how Peacemaker Project 703 came into existence,” Oberheim said.

The death of her husband came at a time when the family was already dealing with a health challenge involving one of their four daughters.

In May 2020, the child began suffering from debilitating headaches without a diagnosis. “No matter how hard I tried and how many things we attempted, I could not fix her,” said Oberheim, who has a medical background as a nurse practitioner.

After more than two years of hospital and doctor visits, the child recently underwent a surgery to remove a cyst in her brain. Oberheim became emotional as she shared a photo of the daughter in a hospital bed offering a thumbs up and news that she recently under went surgery. While it is still early, Oberheim said the prognosis is good.

Throughout her recent life challenges, Oberheim said she would hear the words “Fear not” in her head.

She often wondered why those words kept resonating in her thoughts, eventually finding her answer in the Bible. The verse, Isaiah 41:10, reads: “Fear not for I am with you ... I will strengthen you. I will help you.”

Oberheim said she continues to use the same encouragement, as well as God’s direction, while continuing to use a tragic event to bring positive change and support for police and other first responders.",Q4
https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/epa-super-sizes-proposal-to-crack-down-2142995/,EPA Super Sizes Proposal to Crack Down on Methane from Oil and Gas Sector,"This article is the second in a two-part series analyzing recent proposals by federal agencies to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas production. The first article addresses the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) Proposed Rule.

On December 6, 2022, EPA published a supplemental proposed rule (Proposed Rule) to reduce methane and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from oil and natural gas facilities, including first-time presumptive standards for existing oil and gas facilities. 87 Fed. Reg. 74,702. The Proposed Rule, which follows an initial proposal and request for comment on November 15, 2021, will have important (and costly) implications for oil and gas operations if finalized as proposed. Comments are due on February 13, 2023.

This rulemaking is proposed under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and builds upon existing New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for emissions of methane and VOCs from oil and natural gas sources that are constructed, modified, or reconstructed after November 15, 2021 (NSPS OOOOb) while setting aggressive presumptive standards for methane emissions from existing sources (EG OOOOc). EPA’s proposed approach includes the following major elements that would apply to both new and existing sources, which are discussed in more detail below:

Fugitive Emissions : Ties fugitive emissions monitoring requirements to the types and amount of equipment at a site rather than to estimated emissions and increases frequency of monitoring for all sources.

: Ties fugitive emissions monitoring requirements to the types and amount of equipment at a site rather than to estimated emissions and increases frequency of monitoring for all sources. Alternative Monitoring : Allows facilities (and regulators) a wider selection of methane detection technologies for fugitive emissions monitoring in lieu of OGI surveys or EPA Method 21.

: Allows facilities (and regulators) a wider selection of methane detection technologies for fugitive emissions monitoring in lieu of OGI surveys or EPA Method 21. Well Closure : Imposes ongoing fugitive monitoring requirements until wells are plugged according to well closure plan submitted to permitting authority.

: Imposes ongoing fugitive monitoring requirements until wells are plugged according to well closure plan submitted to permitting authority. Flaring: Restricts flaring to times when there is no other feasible route to a sales line or other beneficial use.

Restricts flaring to times when there is no other feasible route to a sales line or other beneficial use. Super-Emitter Response Program : Creates a new program requiring owners and operators to undertake a root cause analysis and take prompt corrective actions when an approved third party detects large methane emissions events.

: Creates a new program requiring owners and operators to undertake a root cause analysis and take prompt corrective actions when an approved third party detects large methane emissions events. Pneumatic Controllers, Pneumatic Pumps, and Centrifugal Compressors: Requires the use of zero-emissions pneumatic controllers and pumps at both new and existing facilities. Pneumatic pumps at an affected facility could not be driven by natural gas.

NSPS OOOOb

The Proposed Rule follows up on EPA’s earlier NSPS regulations for the oil and natural gas sector at 40 CFR part 60, subparts OOOO (“Quad O”) and OOOOa (“Quad Oa”), which imposes various requirements depending on the date of construction, modification, and reconstruction.

EG OOOOc

The Proposed Rule also includes the first nationwide emissions guidelines for states to limit methane from existing oil and gas facilities under EPA’s authority to establish standards of performance for existing sources in CAA § 111(d). The Proposed Rule would create a new subpart OOOOc (“Quad Oc”) requiring states to regulate methane from existing oil and gas facilities. States would be required to submit plans to EPA within 18 months after final guidelines are published in the Federal Register. State would then be required to impose a compliance deadline on existing source no later than 36 months after the plan is due. EPA states in the Proposed Rule that compliance with the state or Federal plan implementing Quad Oc would constitute compliance for sources currently regulated by Quad O and Quad Oa, since the proposed presumptive standards would result in the same or greater emission reductions.

Major Elements

Totaling 146 pages with another 600 pages in regulatory text (NSPS OOOOb and EG OOOOc) available in the rulemaking docket, EPA’s Proposed Rule contains extensive provisions to reduce emissions of methane and VOCs from the oil and natural gas sector. Along with similar regulatory actions, the Proposed Rule is a crucial part of the Biden Administration’s agenda to combat climate change and reduce emissions from the oil and natural gas sector.

The key requirements of the Proposed Rule include:

Fugitive Emissions

EPA’s Proposal Rule would expand on the 2021 proposal by requiring regular inspections of all wellheads, no matter their input. The Proposed Rule ties fugitive emissions monitoring requirements to the types and amount of equipment at a site rather than to estimated emissions. Under the Proposed Rule, single wellhead-only sites would be required to undergo quarterly audio, visual and olfactory (AVO) inspections. Wellhead-only sites with two or more wells would be required to undergo quarterly AVO inspections and semi-annual monitoring using optical gas imaging (OGI) surveys or EPA Method 21.

For centralized production facilities or sites with major equipment, EPA would require AVO inspections every other month and quarterly monitoring using OGI or EPA Method 21. Compressor stations would require monthly AVO inspections and quarterly monitoring using OGI or EPA Method 21. Well sites and compressor stations on the Alaska North Slope would be subject to a different annual monitoring requirements to account for the weather.

The Proposed Rule also includes deadlines for leak repairs depending on the how the fugitive emissions are identified. Owners and operators would be required to complete repairs of leaks identified through AVO inspections within 15 days after the first repair attempt. Leaks identified through OGI surveys would have slightly longer, with first attempts at repair required within 30 days and final repairs to be completed in 30 days from the first attempt.

Alternative Monitoring

EPA’s Proposed Rule would allow facilities a wider selection of methane detection technologies for fugitive emissions monitoring in lieu of OGI surveys or EPA Method 21. As an alternative, EPA has proposed a screening “matrix” which would specify several different screening frequencies corresponding to a range of minimum detection levels. Additionally, EPA’s Proposed Rule would allow facilities the option of using continuous monitoring systems as an alternative to periodic screening. The Proposed Rule would also establish a streamlined process for EPA to approve alternative test methods. Once EPA approves a technology and technique, owners and operators would then have approval to use it going forward.

Well Closure

EPA’s Proposed Rule would also require fugitive emissions monitoring to continue for the life of the well until it was properly closed. Owners and operators would be required to submit a well closure plan, which would entail a plan for plugging all wells, documentation of financial assurance, and a schedule for completion. The Proposed Rule would require owners and operators to conduct a final OGI survey to ensure no continuing emissions and make repairs, if necessary. Once the OGI survey confirms no emissions are present, EPA would consider the site closed and fugitive emissions monitoring would cease.

Flaring

EPA’s Proposed Rule would also greatly restrict flaring by limiting it only to times when there is no other feasible route to a sales line or other beneficial use. Associated gas could not be routed to a flare unless an operator demonstrated that all options were infeasible due to a technical or safety reason and the demonstration was approved by certified professional engineer. EPA’s Proposed Rules would also require continuous monitoring to ensure the pilot was burning at all times.

Super-Emitter Response Program

Based upon recent studies showing that the very largest methane emissions events (super-emitters) at sources (often cause by malfunctions or abnormal operating conditions) are responsible for the majority of total emissions, EPA is proposing the creation of a super-emitter response program to prevent, detect, and repair these super-emitter events (defined as quantified emissions of 100 kg/hr or greater of methane).

The new response program would allow EPA-approved third parties to identify these super-emitter events using specific remote detection methods (i.e., remote-sensing aircraft, mobile monitoring platforms, or satellite) and then notify owners and operators when an event is detected. Once notified, owners and operators would be required to perform a root-cause analysis within five days and take corrective actions within 10 days if the event is caused by a malfunction or abnormal operation. Corrective actions taking longer than 10 days would require submittal of a corrective action plan to EPA or the state agency. By harnessing citizen-led enforcement and advanced technology, this new initiative is part of a broader and fundamental change in how industry is regulated.

Pneumatic Controllers, Pneumatic Pumps, and Centrifugal Compressors

Lastly, EPA’s Proposed Rule establishes standards for pneumatic controllers, pneumatic pumps, and centrifugal compressors at both new and existing facility. Since the Proposed Rule will also apply to existing facilities, owners and operators would be required, in some cases, to retrofit facilities.

Under the Proposed Rule, pneumatic pumps at an affected facility could not be driven by natural gas. Owners at sites with no onsite power would have to route emission from gas-driven pumps to a process on site unless infeasible. If infeasible, emissions control requirements would depend on the number of pumps on site. For pneumatic controllers, the Proposed Rule updates the definition of a pneumatic controller-affected facility from a single controller to a collection of natural gas-driven pneumatic controllers at a well-site. Self-contained natural gas pneumatic controllers, as well as controllers routed to a sales line or used for onsite, would still be permitted but would not be allowed to directly emit methane and VOCs. Finally, the Proposed Rule sets requirements for new and existing dry seal centrifugal compressors by requiring owners or operators to maintain the volumetric flow rate at or below 3 standard cubic feet per minute.",Q4
https://thebeatofthecapital.com/2022/12/20/jackson-neighbors-express-concerns-about-capitol-police-during-forum/,Jackson neighbors express concerns about Capitol police during forum,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – During a community forum Monday night, Jackson city leaders and community members sat down to discuss their biggest complaints and concerns about the Capitol Police Department.

The forum was held at New Jerusalem Church with one main topics of discussion, Capitol police.

“We are not against the Capitol police. We are not against policing. We are for proper policing and good policing,” said New Jerusalem Church Pastor Dwayne Pickett.

Several residents claim they’ve had unpleasant run-ins with officers from the department. The family of Jaylen Lewis, the man who was shot and killed by Capitol police in September, also spoke out. His sister rushed to the crime scene when she found out her brother had been shot.

“I was handcuffed that night for trying to record what was going on. The man claimed that it was because I was standing in the middle of an intersection and it was for my safety, which I don’t believe,” she stated.

While the overall goal for leaders is to make Jackson safer, they believe there should be more accountability and transparency from the recently expanded law enforcement agency.

“To best serve a community, you must understand the community that you serve, and we must be transparent so we can avoid meetings such as this,” said Jackson Police Chief James Davis.

“I told you what I would do if it was a JPD matter. This is a different circumstance, and it is a bit more troubling because we don’t have direct responsibility or any influence over the Capitol Complex Police,” said Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba.

Pickett said Capitol police agreed to meet with him and other community leaders, and he plans to take all of the concerns from this forum to the Capitol Police Chief.

WJTV 12 News reached out to the Mississippi Department of Public Safety (DPS) about the concerns from the forum.

“We have plans that we’re working on to add community resource officers to be in the community and work closely with community leaders, and we’re willing to have these conversations anytime and want to have them,” said DPS Commissioner Sean Tindell.",Q4
https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/education/north-carolina-professor-fired-criticizing-critical-race-theory-lawsuit,North Carolina professor was fired for criticizing critical race theory: Lawsuit,"

A professor is suing the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction after he was allegedly fired for criticizing critical race theory while teaching at a state-organized summer program for incoming high school seniors.

The lawsuit, filed by the conservative free speech law group the Alliance Defending Freedom, says David Phillips, an English professor from North Carolina, was abruptly fired from his summer teaching job at the Governor’s School, a four-week program for high-performing high school seniors in North Carolina after he openly criticized critical race theory.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY DEEMS ‘AMERICAN’ HARMFUL LANGUAGE

Phillips had taught at the Governor’s School for eight years, the lawsuit says. On June 28, 2021, at the conclusion of an optional seminar on viewpoint diversity in higher education where Phillips noted that the presence of critical race theory and other similar ideas contributed greatly to a culture of monolithic thought, audience members peppered the professor with questions and criticized him for objecting to progressive ideas on race and culture.

The lawsuit says that Phillips “calmly” responded to questions for more than an hour and even offered to discuss the issues raised further in private meetings.

But the next day, Phillips was summoned by the administration of the Governor’s School and promptly fired. When he inquired about the reason for his termination, an administrator allegedly told him that he could not share that information.

In a press release, Alliance Defending Freedom senior counsel Hal Frampton said that academic environments should not be hostile to a diversity of opinions and that “no teacher should be fired for offering a reasoned critique of critical theory.”

“There is no lawful explanation for the way North Carolina public school officials treated Dr. Phillips,” Frampton said. “He was beloved, respected, and regarded by both students and faculty as an advocate for students who felt that their voices weren’t being heard and their perspectives weren’t welcomed at the Governor’s School. By firing him, the Governor’s School violated his constitutional right to free speech and unlawfully retaliated against him for deviating from the Governor’s School’s ideological orthodoxy.”

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/10/07/illinois-congressional-map-gerrymandering/,Illinois Democrats drew new maps. The changes pushed the GOP to the right.,"The state’s congressional redistricting illustrates how gerrymandering hollows out the political center and strengthens the fringe, experts say. It also helps explain Kevin McCarthy’s downfall.

TAYLORVILLE, Ill. — On a warm Friday night in the St. Mary’s Catholic Church parking lot, sweating men sipping cold beers dipped fish fillets into bubbling deep fryers as children played on the bouncy castle. This down-home fish fry used to be a regular stop for U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis, a moderate Republican who grew up in this former coal town in Central Illinois. But that was before new district lines drawn in 2021 pushed him into far more conservative terrain — and into competition with a fellow GOP incumbent.

Skip to end of carousel Imperfect Union A series examining the ways Americans feel unrepresented by a political system struggling with a collision of forces both old and new. Read more about the project here. End of carousel To keep his job in Congress, Davis had to square off with Rep. Mary E. Miller, a member of the right-wing Freedom Caucus who closely aligned herself with former president Donald Trump. In the primary campaign, she assailed Davis for his willingness to compromise with Democrats and to acknowledge Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election. Miller, the hard-liner, won the 2022 race. Davis, the consensus-seeker, was out. The bitter Republican feuding was not merely a symptom of the broader civil war in the national party. Rather, it was prompted by the actions of Illinois Democrats, who used their supermajority in the legislature to redraw district lines in a way that would strengthen their already titanium-solid lock on power. The strategy worked, adding one Democratic seat to the Illinois delegation and trimming two Republican ones as GOP voters were packed into a smaller number of districts.

The new map also accomplished what experts say gerrymandering does with ruthless efficiency, regardless of whether Democrats or Republicans are responsible: hollowing out the moderate political center and driving both parties further toward the ideological fringes.

“Gerrymandering undermines a key element of democracy, which is competition,” said Harvard University government professor Steven Levitsky.

Politicians representing more-evenly split districts fear general election competition and therefore tend to govern more moderately, Levitsky said. But those in lopsided districts worry more about primary challenges and become responsive to the extremes in their party.

The consequences were on vivid display during the past couple of weeks in Congress as a small group of hard-right Republicans drove the government to the brink of a shutdown and then expelled Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) from the post of House Speaker, the first speaker in the nation’s history to be ousted by members of his own party. The eight GOP members who voted to reject him represent districts that are safely Republican, with little to fear in general-election contests against Democrats.

Miller was not among those eight dissenters, but she was part of a larger group of hard-right Republicans that had earlier blocked McCarthy’s spending plans — forcing him to work with Democrats to avert a government shutdown, a collaboration that helped to seal his fate.

Levitsky, a co-author of the book “Tyranny of the Minority,” said the push to the extremes has been particularly evident in the Trump-led Republican Party and that gerrymandering is one cause among many.

“What’s really new about our politics today is that the radical fringe on the right, who are pretty authoritarian and pretty nativist, are now exercising outsize power,” Levitsky said.

But for both parties, the primary election — dominated by the most ideologically committed voters — has become more important as districts with competitive general elections have dwindled. Over the past quarter-century, the number of House swing seats, as calculated by the Cook Political Report, has been cut in half — from 164 in 1999 to an estimated 82 in next year’s election. Only 25 incumbents — 6 percent of the House’s 435 seats — were defeated in 2022. Sixteen of them lost in primaries.

Gerrymandering isn’t the only factor driving that phenomenon; geographic sorting, in which cities have become bluer and rural areas redder, has contributed mightily.

Drawing lines to favor your own party also is not a new dynamic. But it has become more common and aggressive with the rise of supermajority state legislatures and a 2019 Supreme Court ruling that federal courts have no role in policing partisan efforts to rig district maps.

In recent years, Republicans have used their dominance at the state level to create highly favorable maps in large states, such as Texas and Florida, as well as smaller ones, including Tennessee and Utah. But where Democratic legislators control the process, they’ve proved equally adept at creating maps advantageous to their party.

The Princeton Gerrymandering Project, a nonpartisan group that studies the issue nationally, gave the Illinois map an “F” rating and classified none of the state’s 17 congressional districts as competitive.

Although Democratic voters unquestionably outnumber Republicans in the state — Biden defeated Trump by 17 points in Illinois in 2020 — the effect is exaggerated by district lines that have helped to give Democrats a 14-3 advantage in the state’s congressional delegation. In a comparison with a baseline map with no partisan advantage, Princeton researchers found that Illinois Democrats had given themselves three additional seats — a total matched only by Republicans in Texas.

Illinois’ new district lines for 2022 made the few GOP districts that remained even redder, which created a problem for two moderate Republicans. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an outspoken Trump critic who was certain to have drawn a strong primary challenge in 2022, opted to leave Congress. Davis fought to stay but found his moderate record used against him in his reelection bid against Miller.

His willingness to reach across the aisle had made him a favored partner of Democrats and had helped him win general elections in his politically balanced district. But that instinct for compromise, he said in an interview, became a liability under the new Democratic-drawn map.

Davis said he was hammered in the primary for “pictures with Biden. Pictures with Obama. Not Trumpy enough. Voted for common sense immigration reform, etc., etc., etc.”

Davis called the gerrymandering and Miller’s attacks on him unsurprising.

At the Taylorville fish fry, some of Davis’s former constituents were more pointed.

“Rodney got screwed,” said Bob Davis, 88, a retired school administrator having dinner with his family at a picnic table. “I think it should be illegal. When you intentionally draw the lines for political reasons, I think that’s wrong.”

The cost of bipartisanship

Manipulation of voting districts has been around since at least 18th-century England. It became known as “gerrymandering” in 1812 when Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry approved a district whose odd shape reminded people of a salamander.

The new 13th District in Illinois more closely resembles a snake. It squiggles across 175 miles of lightly populated and Republican-leaning farmland and connects the more urban and Democratic-leaning areas of East St. Louis, Springfield, Decatur, Champaign and Urbana.

It is a safely Democratic district, which was won in 2022 by first-time candidate Nikki Budzinski, a longtime labor union official who also served in the Biden administration.

Taylorville had been part of the old 13th District, which was split fairly evenly between Republicans and Democrats, with just a four-point GOP advantage, according to the Cook Political Report. Davis won the district first in 2012 and was reelected four times, serving 10 years largely as a center-right moderate.

Then, in the most recent redistricting, Taylorville was moved into a new 15th District, a largely rural and conservative bloc that almost completely surrounds the 13th and that had been made significantly more Republican by the shifting lines, giving it a 22-point GOP edge.

As Davis fought to stay in Congress last year, he stressed his Republican bona fides: Campaign materials reminded primary voters that he had been “proud to work with President Trump,” and he sought the former president’s endorsement.

But his opponent, Miller, was quick to note that Davis had also voted to certify Biden’s 2020 election victory, which she called “tainted,” and supported the creation of a congressional commission to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.

In a matchup of Republican incumbents, it wasn’t even close: After Trump came to the district to campaign for Miller, she cruised to a primary victory, 57 percent to 43 percent.

In sharp contrast to Davis’s approach, which he describes as “principled compromise,” Miller is rated by Voteview, a nonpartisan research group that tracks congressional voting and ideology, as more conservative than 98 percent of current House members.

She has called for the impeachments of Biden and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and a ban on further funding for Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion.

Miller did not vote to remove McCarthy when he was ousted from the job Tuesday, explaining in a statement that she wants her party to be “focused on stopping the radical Democrats.” But she has repeatedly sided with a small group of hard-right Republicans that frequently sparred with McCarthy and ultimately doomed his speakership.

Miller, whose office did not respond to requests for an interview, voted against McCarthy’s getting the job of speaker in January. In June she voted against suspending the debt ceiling. Then she voted against the bill that averted the government shutdown.

Political scientists and analysts said that when state Democrats packed so many conservatives into a single district, they created the environment for Miller to win despite holding views that are out of step with most general-election voters in Illinois and even with most GOP House members.

“Gerrymandering really disincentivizes reasonableness and bipartisanship,” said Riley Berg, a senior adviser at Country First, a nonprofit organization founded by Kinzinger after the Jan. 6 attack. “We end up with choices in the general election that are not representative of the vast majority of the electorate.”

Davis said the impact of unchecked gerrymandering was simple and stark: “The cost is Congress not working as our forefathers intended Congress to work.”

“You have people in Congress, in both parties, who are rewarded for not working with the other side,” he said.

Gerrymandering was given a boost in 2019 by the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled 5-4 that partisan redistricting is a political question that must be decided by legislators, not federal courts. The court upheld earlier precedents when it ruled this year that gerrymandering for racial reasons still violates the Voting Rights Act, even as Republican-dominated Southern legislatures, such as Alabama’s, have resisted making maps that comply with the court’s orders.

In most states, the legislature is responsible for drawing district maps. In many of the growing number of states where one party holds a supermajority in the legislature — enough votes to override any veto by the governor — the process of drawing districts for federal and state offices has become increasingly partisan.

At present, 19 Republican states and nine Democratic states have supermajorities. That includes Illinois, where the governor, both U.S. senators and two-thirds of the state legislature are Democrats.

Democrats in the state deny that the lines drawn in 2021 amount to gerrymandering.

“I would say it was a fair and equitable process,” said state Sen. Robert Peters (D). “We took feedback from stakeholders in the community throughout the entire state. And we held hearings all over the state and followed the guidelines to create the map.”

Republicans dismiss such defenses, saying that Democrats used their political supermajority to muscle through a blatant gerrymander.

“Illinois Democrats will tell you they believe in gerrymandering reform, then laugh all the way to drawing districts that eviscerate Republicans,” Davis said.

The parties have different stances on how to address gerrymandering. Democrats have pushed for federal legislation that would require that maps be drawn by independent commissions; Republicans have largely resisted those calls.

For the redistricting process that followed the 2020 Census, 10 states had independent or bipartisan commissions to draw legislative districts, according to the Cook Political Report. They included Democratic-dominated California and Colorado and the key swing states of Arizona and Michigan. Other states had commissions that answered to a partisan legislature.

In states that did not have commissions, Republicans controlled redistricting in 17 and Democrats in seven.

As both parties focus on shoring up their bases, fewer Americans are identifying with either. According to Gallup, close to 50 percent of Americans now consider themselves political independents, while only about a quarter identify as Republicans or Democrats. Two decades ago, independents, Republicans and Democrats each had about a one-third share of voters.

“The middle in America wants its voice and choice back,” said Kent Thiry, a former executive in the health-care industry who runs a group called Unite America that is fighting to reform gerrymandering and the primary voting system. Change is needed, he said, in a political system where “if you cross the aisle, you are not reelected.”

‘Bring dollars back’

Davis, 53, was born and raised in Taylorville, a town of 11,000 people about 25 miles southeast of Springfield, the Illinois capital. Many storefronts along the central square are empty, but a few restaurants and shops are busy. One building still lists the office of “Congressman Rodney Davis” as a second-floor tenant.

When coal was king, the town was pro-union and a Democratic stronghold. But in recent decades, Taylorville has shifted further toward the Republican Party. Mayor Bruce Barry said the town’s strong history with both parties made it fertile ground for a centrist Republican such as Davis.

Miller’s hard-line views, by contrast, don’t “really represent Taylorville,” said Barry, whose position is nonpartisan but who considers himself a centrist Democrat in a moderate Republican town.

“We’re strong Republicans down here, but I don’t think we’re out there way right,” he said. “We look more for common-sense decisions.”

Barry said the town is feeling the sting of Davis’s absence as an advocate for its interests in Washington. Davis, a longtime congressional staffer before he ran for office, was instrumental in getting a $650,000 federal grant for a new industrial park on the edge of town, as well as $2.5 million to resurface West Main Street, a key local thoroughfare, Barry said.

“These are projects that we depend on. We don’t have the tax base that others do,” Barry explained. He expressed frustration that Miller has not applied for funding for local projects in her district.

The House Freedom Caucus, of which Miller is a member, wants a ban on such “earmarks,” often called “pork-barrel” projects. The caucus believes that government spending is out of control and that earmarks represent a lack of fiscal responsibility in Washington, according to its public statements.

“Earmarks facilitate federal overreach by spending taxpayer-dollars on personal pet projects of lawmakers and lobbyists. Earmarks also extend Congress’s power of spending beyond items genuinely connected to the nation’s welfare,” according to the caucus’s rules.

Seth McMillan, a Taylorville native and a former chairman of the Christian County Republican Central Committee, said Davis had been positioned to rise in House leadership and “could have gotten some things done for Central Illinois.”

“People can debate the federal budget all day long, but your job as a representative is to bring dollars back to your district,” McMillan said.

Lamenting the lost center

Oakland is a 90-minute drive east of Taylorville on roads dotted with silos cutting through vast fields of corn and soybeans. In this town of 739 people, residents said they have to drive 20 minutes to get to the nearest large grocery store.

Many storefronts on the small central square have closed, and one features a sign that says, “Pritzker Sucks,” a slam on Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker and a hint at the town’s conservative leanings. Coles County, which includes Oakland, voted 62 percent for Trump in the 2020 general election.

The Millers, a prominent local farming and political family, have lived in the Oakland area for decades.

Mary E. Miller, 64, originally from the western Chicago suburbs, is a longtime area resident who is married to Chris Miller, a Republican state representative and fourth-generation local farmer. They raise cattle, corn and soy on the family farm.

According to her website, “Mary is a wife, mother of seven, grandmother of twenty, and local farmer who serves as a voice for families and farmers ignored by D.C. insiders in the swamp.”

In the most recent redistricting, Oakland was shifted from the 15th Congressional District, represented by Miller, into the 12th Congressional District, which stretches about 200 miles to the southern tip of the state.

But Hindsboro, a town six miles west of Oakland where a Miller spokeswoman said the congresswoman and her family moved earlier this year, is in the 15th.

The district is widely considered the most conservative in the state. After beating Davis in the primary, Miller crushed a Democratic challenger in the general election with 71 percent of the vote.

“I have conversations with Mary quite a bit, but we can’t elect her,” said Oakland Mayor Jack Turner, a Republican who has known the Miller family for decades. “That was taken away from us, and I think that’s unfair.”

Turner, 57, with a bushy gray beard and a sleeveless T-shirt that said, “Stars and Stripes Since 1776,” said that Miller’s conservative politics represented the town well and that he believed the community was harmed in losing her to a partisan gerrymander.

But he also lamented the loss of the moderate center in both parties and expressed disappointment in the Republican rebellion that ended in McCarthy’s removal as speaker.

“Now you’re either way left or way right,” he said in an interview in the town’s tiny municipal building. “There used to be a middle road, and the middle road was fine. Why does it have to be this extreme?”

Voters reward GOP for economics, but culture wars pull us apart.","Editor's note: This is the fourth in a series of columns exploring the future of the Republican Party and the conservative movement.

Are Americans dividing – not just ideologically but also geographically – over politics? That appears increasingly to be the case.

An Axios poll conducted in late July found that 58% of Republicans and 55% of Democrats have “thought about moving to a state where the government better reflects their political and policy values.” And 69% of Democrats and 65% of Republicans have “considered moving to a state that’s a closer match with their cultural and social values.”

In 2021, a Redfin survey found that about 15% of respondents who had recently moved said they would not live in a place where abortion is fully legal, and that 17% said they prefer not to live in a state where abortion is fully legal. On the other side, 12% of respondents said they would live only in a place where abortion is fully legal; 28% said they would prefer to live in a state without legal restrictions on abortion.

Combined, 72% of people surveyed said they would consider relocating based on a state’s laws regulating abortion. And that was months before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this June.

Urban vs. rural split is severe

Voting patterns already reflect this trend. Not a single city in the United States with a population of more than 1 million people is led by a Republican mayor. Long gone are the days when Republicans Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg served as mayor of New York.

In America's rural areas, home to a combined 46 million people, it's Democrats who have become an endangered species.

Red states and blue states increasingly are moving in opposite directions on education policy, tax rates and, of course, abortion. The nation's second most populous state, Texas, has now effectively banned abortion. In contrast, the most populated state, California, has become a self-proclaimed sanctuary for women seeking abortions.

Where do our growing divisions, and our growing geographical segregation based on politics, lead us? Are we becoming Red America and Blue America instead of the United States of America?

Polarization leads to extremism

I'm worried. A psychological phenomenon called group polarization involves “the tendency for groups to show a shift toward the extremes of decision-making when compared to decisions made by individuals.” In other words, when in a like-minded group, individuals tend to become more extreme.

Imagine what this might look like at the state and national levels as we self-segregate based on ideology. Toxic polarization will become even more difficult to defuse once we are surrounded by people who share the same ""enemies list"" as ours.

Are you a traditional conservative or a Trump Republican? Take our quiz

Yet there's hope – and an opening for Republican leaders – based on economics. The Axios poll found that economic reasons such as cost of living and jobs remain the primary reason people move from one state to another.

And it's red states such as Florida and Texas that tend to have lower taxes, fewer regulations and a much friendlier business environment. It's not by accident that companies such as Caterpillar, Citadel, Hewlett Packard, Oracle and Tesla have left deep blue California and Illinois for better opportunities in the Republican havens of Florida and Texas.

In a 2022 poll conducted by Chief Executive, about 700 CEOs and business owners ranked Texas as the best state for business, a ranking the state has held every year since 2001. Texas has no personal income tax, no corporate income tax, low regulation and a low cost of living. Among those moving to Texas from other states, the top reasons listed are jobs, less expensive land and homes, and lower taxes.

Florida, which also boasts of no state income tax and less regulation, was No. 2 on the Chief Executive list of best states for businesses. California was dead last.

Red and blue America don't trust each other. And that's driving us dangerously apart.

It's not just corporations that are flocking to red states. Millions of Americans are as well. Six of the 10 fastest-growing states in the nation, including Florida and Texas, are dominated by Republicans. And in two other states on that list, Arizona and Nevada, several statewide GOP candidates appear poised to win in November.

Republicans surge in Florida

Even as Florida's population has grown rapidly, it has become more conservative. Only one Democrat, Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, holds statewide office in Florida. Republican voters now outnumber Democratic voters for the first time in Florida's modern history.

Democrats continue to hold out hope of one day returning Texas to its historical position as a blue state. But for now, not a single Democrat holds statewide office in the Lone Star State.

Goodbye, San Francisco. Hello, Nashville:Americans are fleeing dysfunctional cities.

As long as economics remains the dominant reason for state-to-state migration and voter loyalty, Republicans and the conservative movement have a bright future.

But the tendency of some prominent Republican leaders to dwell on hot-button cultural issues could hurt the party's long-term chances. How many business leaders had second thoughts when Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis took on ""woke"" Disney this year. How many people, especially younger women, grew more hesitant about living in Texas now that it has a near total ban on abortion?

Beyond state level considerations, I fear that a further balkanization of the nation into red America and blue America will make our politics at the federal level even uglier and more dangerous.

If neither side is willing to live with one another, let alone talk to each other, then every election will seem more and more critical and wins and losses harder to accept. Already, we've seen supporters of former President Donald Trump storm the U.S. Capitol because they refused to acknowledge his election loss.

A Republican Party and conservative movement that champion individual liberty, the rule of law and economic growth can compete anywhere and against anyone. But a party and movement that wage culture wars and appeal only to voters who share the same values will pull us further apart.

Americans are free to choose, of course, if they want to move to places that best represent their values. But let’s not forget that we still share a country together.

https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2022/11/09/694621.htm,Washington AG Investigating ‘Possible Discrimination’ for Insurers Using Credit Scores,"Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced that a Thurston County Superior Court judge rejected an attempt by PEMCO Mutual Insurance Company and subsidiaries of the Progressive Corporation to stop his office’s investigation of potential race discrimination against Washington drivers.

The companies both use consumer credit histories to decide whether to sell, and at what price to sell, their auto insurance products. This is despite evidence that this practice disproportionately harms people of color, according to Ferguson’s office.

Washington Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler tried to ban credit scoring by insurers, but a judge in late August ruled he exceeded his authority when he issued a permanent rule banning the use of credit-based insurance scores.

PEMCO and Progressive have a significant presence in Washington, and both companies use credit history or credit-based insurance scores to decide who they will provide coverage to and at what price.

According to Ferguson’s office, PEMCO charges people with low credit scores as much as triple those with high credit scores, and Progressive significantly increases premiums for individuals with negative credit histories.

The companies brought the matter to court to fight the office’s investigation.

Spokespersons for both companies have been reached out to for comment.

A Progressive spokesperson replied to an email requesting comment with the following statement:

“Progressive seeks to price each policy to reflect expected driving behavior and related losses using factors that are objective, predictive, permitted by state law, and approved by state regulators. Insurers are prohibited from using factors like race, income, religion or ethnicity, and we do not use any of these factors or other variables as proxies for those characteristics or attributes. We are fully compliant with all applicable laws and regulations in Washington State, and we do not engage in or condone race discrimination of any kind in any of our business practices.”

Mark Sektnan, vice president for state government relations of the American Property Casualty Insurers Association, said insurers are prohibited from using race as a rating factor, and that consumers benefit from the use of insurance underwriting factors that are directly predictive of losses like credit scoring because those factors make protection more affordable and available.

“Credit-based insurance scores have greatly enhanced insurance availability and are demonstrated to have a direct correlation with driving behaviors such as hard-braking and hard-acceleration. Numerous studies have proven they are highly predictive,” Sektnan said. “The use of credit- based insurance scores is expressly allowed in statute and has been affirmed by the courts. Multiple studies by a variety of subject matter experts and government entities have shown that credit-based insurance scoring is highly predictive of the risk of future loss resulting in the most accurate rates without discriminating based on race. The Washington Legislature has rejected legislation to ban or limit its use several times.”

The Attorney General’s Office is seeking information about PEMCO and Progressive’s compliance with the Washington Consumer Protection Act and the Washington Law Against Discrimination as part of its investigation.

The Washington Law Against Discrimination prohibits discrimination in insurance transactions on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, citizenship or immigration status, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, or honorably discharged veteran or military status.

Actors Emma Thompson, Penelope Cruz, Kate Winslet, Ian McKellen and directors Ken Loach and Mike Leigh were among a host of luminaries to sign an open letter demanding the star of The Salesman be freed.

“As members of the international arts community, we demand the immediate release of Academy Award-winning actress, mother and activist Taraneh Alidoosti, who was arrested on 17 December 2022 and has been taken into custody at Evin prison, Iran, where many other political prisoners also remain,” the letter says.

Alidoosti, 38, was arrested on Saturday, official media said, after making a string of social media posts supporting the protest movement — including removing her headscarf and condemning the execution of protesters.

The actor is one of the most prominent figures arrested in a crackdown by Iran’s hardline regime that has seen the detention of lawyers, cultural figures, journalists and campaigners.

“The Iranian authorities have strategically chosen to arrest Taraneh before Christmas to ensure her international peers would be distracted,” the letter continues.

“But we are not distracted. We are outraged. Taraneh Alidoosti, like all citizens of Iran, has a right to freedom of expression, freedom of association, and freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention.

“We hereby stand in solidarity with her and demand her immediate release and safe return to her family.”

The Islamic republic has been shaken by protests since Amini’s September 16 death in custody after her arrest by the morality police for allegedly violating Iran’s strict dress rules for women.

At least 14,000 people have been arrested since the nationwide unrest began, the United Nations said last month.

The United States on Tuesday condemned Alidoosti’s arrest as “part of the regime’s effort to sow fear and suppress these peaceful protests.”

The open letter comes after “The Salesman” director Asghar Farhadi took to Instagram to demand Alidoosti’s freedom.

Alidoosti appeared in two of Farhadi’s earliest films before he won international renown, Beautiful City (2004) and Fireworks Wednesday (2006).

She then appeared in the 2009 film About Elly, which earned Farhadi the Silver Bear for best director at the Berlin film festival, before reuniting for The Salesman in 2016.

This is the first report of neoadjuvant T-DXd for patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-low, localized breast cancer. It could provide the groundwork for future studies with antibody-drug conjugates, including T-DXd, for patients with early-stage breast cancer."" Aditya Bardia, MD, MPH, attending physician at Mass General Cancer Center and director of breast cancer research and associate professor at Harvard Medical School

Patients with localized, high-risk breast cancer are often given chemotherapy before undergoing surgery. However, when such tumors express the estrogen receptor and/or the progesterone receptor, the pathological complete response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is less than 5 percent, necessitating new treatment options, Bardia said.

T-DXd is an antibody-drug conjugate that is internalized into cancer cells upon binding to HER2. Once inside, it releases a cytotoxic payload that causes DNA damage and kills the cancer cell. It is currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat several types of tumors that overexpress HER2, and it was recently approved to treat metastatic breast cancer with low HER2 expression.

""While T-DXd demonstrated impressive efficacy in metastatic HER2-low breast cancer, to date, no trial has evaluated T-DXd in localized, early-stage, potentially curable HER2-low breast cancer, which led us to design this neoadjuvant clinical trial,"" said Sara Hurvitz, MD, medical director of the Clinical Research Unit at Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, a professor of medicine in the Division of Hematology/Oncology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and co-author of the study.

Bardia, Hurvitz, and colleagues conducted the phase II TRIO-US B-12 TALENT clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of T-DXd when used as a neoadjuvant treatment, either alone or in combination with the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole. At the time of first data cutoff (10/05/2022), 17 patients had completed the planned eight cycles of T-DXd, and 16 patients had completed the planned six cycles of T-DXd plus anastrozole.

According to Bardia, the primary endpoint for the study was a 5 percent pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, defined as complete tumor regression and no lymph node involvement at the time of surgery. At the time of first data cutoff, no patients had experienced a pCR in the combination treatment arm, and one out of 19 patients (5.3 percent) had experienced a pCR in the solo treatment arm.

As of the data cutoff, 33 patients had completed neoadjuvant treatment and undergone surgery, seven patients were awaiting surgery, and 13 patients were still undergoing T-DXd treatment. Among the response-evaluable population, in the solo treatment arm, the overall response rate was 75 percent, including 11 partial responses and one complete response. In the combination treatment arm, the overall response rate was 63 percent, including 10 partial responses and two complete responses.

The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were hypokalemia, diarrhea, neutropenia, fatigue, headache, vomiting, dehydration, and nausea, each of which occurred in fewer than 6 percent of patients. One patient developed grade 2 interstitial lung disease, which resolved after treatment discontinuation.

Total patient numbers and efficacy data are immature and will be updated at the time of the meeting.

Hurvitz stressed that the clinical outcome results, including pCR and overall response rate, are not mature, as not all patients had scans or underwent surgery by the time of data cutoff. Overall, the tolerability and overall response data were encouraging and may warrant future studies on T-DXd in this patient population, Hurvitz said.

""The study demonstrated that T-DXd was relatively safe in HER2-low, hormone receptor-positive, localized breast cancer. It provides translational framework for future studies, including combination regimens in the neoadjuvant setting to further improve clinical outcomes,"" Bardia said.

Bardia, Hurvitz and colleagues aim to follow up on this work by analyzing potential biomarkers from tumor tissue and blood samples taken before, during, and after treatment. Bardia hopes these biomarkers will help researchers more accurately assess HER2 status, predict which tumors will have the best responses to T-DXd treatment, and illuminate potential mechanisms of T-DXd resistance.

Limitations of this study include a small sample size characteristic of phase II studies, which did not allow for a formal comparison of the two treatment arms. Additionally, the primary and secondary endpoints of this study assessed response but did not evaluate long-term survival.

The study was conducted as an investigator-initiated study by the Translational Research In Oncology (TRIO)-US network. Funding for this study was provided by Daiichi Sankyo.

THREAD: THE TWITTER FILES PART FIVE.



THE REMOVAL OF TRUMP FROM TWITTER. — Bari Weiss (@bariweiss) December 12, 2022

Weiss' thread picked up the story on January 8, 2021, when Trump had ""one remaining strike before being at risk of permanent suspension from Twitter"" and he fired off two tweets in the early morning hours. One, a message to those who voted for Trump in the 2020 election, and the second announcing his decision not to attend the inauguration of Joe Biden.

As Weiss explained, ""Twitter had resisted calls both internal and external to ban Trump on the grounds that blocking a world leader from the platform or removing their controversial tweets would hide important information that people should be able to see and debate."" That was a stated position of the company, Weiss pointed out. In 2019, Twitter wrote that its ""mission is to provide a forum that enables people to be informed and to engage their leaders directly"" in order to ""protect the public's right to hear from their leaders and to hold them to account.""

Previous installments of the Twitter Files have shown how calls for Trump to be excised from Twitter's platform grew louder, especially after January 6, 2021, but that didn't mean that everyone within Twitter was gung-ho on banning Trump.

One conversation Weiss tweeted is from an employee who is ""from China"" and said ""I deeply understand how censorship can destroy the public conversation."" Still, Weiss noted, ""voices like that one appear to have been a distinct minority within the company"" and ""many Twitter employees were upset that Trump hadn't been banned earlier.""

7. There were dissenters inside Twitter.



“Maybe because I am from China,” said one employee on January 7, “I deeply understand how censorship can destroy the public conversation.” pic.twitter.com/LtonK0gfS3 — Bari Weiss (@bariweiss) December 12, 2022

What followed — and Weiss documented in her latest dispatch on the ""Twitter Files"" — was a concerted effort as ""Twitter employees organized to demand their employer ban Trump."" Those efforts included claims that Trump was trying ""to thread the needle of incitement without violating the rules.""

10. “We have to do the right thing and ban this account,” said one staffer.



It’s “pretty obvious he’s going to try to thread the needle of incitement without violating the rules,” said another. pic.twitter.com/9vgvSgqJBB — Bari Weiss (@bariweiss) December 12, 2022

Those employees' efforts resulted in an open letter being published by The Washington Post on January 8 that was signed by more than 300 Twitter employees calling for then-CEO Jack Dorsey to pull the trigger and ban Trump.

However, Twitter employees ""quickly concluded that Trump had *not* violated Twitter's policies,"" Weiss explained. Employees apparently struggled to build the case that Trump's tweets from earlier on January 8 constituted ""incitement."" At least one employee on the Twitter policy team reported that a review of the latest tweets from the president did not find any violations by Trump.

Even more explicitly, she said ""Safety has assessed the DJT Tweet above and determined that there is no violation of our policies at this time.""

The same conclusion was reached later that morning about Trump's other tweet. ""It's a clear no vio[lation],"" they concluded. ""It's just to say he's not attending the inauguration.""

18. Next, Twitter’s safety team decides that Trump’s 7:44 am ET tweet is also not in violation. They are unequivocal: “it’s a clear no vio. It’s just to say he’s not attending the inauguration” pic.twitter.com/zdxSsG1UBS — Bari Weiss (@bariweiss) December 12, 2022

Despite the findings of Twitter employees, executive Vijaya Gadde looked for a workaround, an excuse, to ban Trump anyway by suggesting Trump's not-in-violation tweets were actually ""coded incitement.""

26. Less than 90 minutes after Twitter employees had determined that Trump’s tweets were not in violation of Twitter policy, Vijaya Gadde—Twitter’s Head of Legal, Policy, and Trust—asked whether it could, in fact, be “coded incitement to further violence.” pic.twitter.com/llJRMfpOPi — Bari Weiss (@bariweiss) December 12, 2022

Gadde's efforts were escalated by others within Twitter, who suggested reading Trump's tweet out of context could allow them to slap it with a violation of the company's ""Glorification of Violence"" policy.

27.

As this was all growing out of control among Twitter's nearly entirely homogenous ideological bent, Twitter leaders call an all-staff meeting where CEO Dorsey and Gadde answer questions from the employees had gotten themselves worked up into a frothing mess. As it turns out, according to internal chats tweeted in Weiss' thread, the meeting did not tamp down the growing anger of the mob.

Some employees, including Yoel Roth, grew worried that Dorsey was preparing to share the reasoning behind Twitter's suspension of Trump.

Shortly thereafter, Twitter announced it had banned the President of the United States, to which employees reacted jubilantly, as the leftist thrill of virtue signaling coursed through their veins after putting another feather in their cap in their intolerant campaign to silence those with whom they disagree.

https://news.yahoo.com/akron-community-protests-8-officers-234931061.html,Akron community protests after 8 officers involved in Jayland Walker shooting return to work,"Protesters took to Highland Square on Wednesday evening, one day after the Akron Police Department announced that the eight Akron police officers who are under investigation for their involvement in the June shooting death of Jayland Walker have returned to work in the office.

The protest in Highland Square around 6:20 p.m. entered West Market Street and blocked all traffic for several minutes. The protesters then moved into the lot next to the Highland Square branch of the Akron-Summit County Public Library, chanting obscenities about police.

The officers, who have been on paid administrative leave since Walker's death June 27, are being reassigned to administrative duty due to staffing issues within the department after several officers have left, said Akron Police Chief Steve Mylett.

The officers, whose names haven't been released due to what the department said are safety concerns, won't be in the community on patrol, but will provide ""internal support"" until the investigation is complete, according to the police department. They aren't in uniform and aren't responding to calls.

Protesters take to Highland Square in Akron on Wednesday, Oct. 12, 2022, one day after the Akron Police Department said the eight involved in Jayland Walker's shooting death have returned to work in the office.

Walker, 25, was fatally shot more than 40 times by Akron police after an attempted traffic stop for minor equipment violations. After a car and foot chase, Walker was shot by police, according to body-camera footage released by the city.

He was unarmed during the shooting, but officials said he fired a shot from his vehicle less than a minute into the chase. A handgun was found in his vehicle.

Jayland Walker officers return to work:8 Akron officers involved in shooting death of Jayland Walker return to desk duty

Walker’s death has led to multiple protests over the last nearly four months in downtown Akron as demonstrators demand justice and accountability for the eight officers involved in his death.

Community response to officers returning to work

The NAACP has asked U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to open a federal civil rights investigation into Walker's death.

The announcement about the eight officers returning to work came one day after a rally was held for Walker, during which his mother, Pam Walker, told people ""please don't give up on us.""

“I am disappointed, but I'm not surprised,” Akron NAACP President Judi Hill said Tuesday of the officers returning to work. “I just think the timing of this is very interesting, after we just had a unity march.”

Hill said she questioned whether returning the eight to office duty will help maintain police services.

“There are some people who feel like they're getting paid to sit at home and it’s a vacation,"" Hill said. ""My take has always been I would prefer them not be in that building.""

Jayland Walker rally:Organizers gather in Akron to continue push for police reform, justice for Jayland Walker

The Freedom BLOC in Akron released a statement on social media Tuesday condemning the decision to allow the officers to return to work. The officers should not be working in the Akron Police Department, the group said.

""This is unacceptable, and our community is outraged,"" the statement read in part. ""That is the exact opposite of what the Walker Family and our community have been demanding for the past 106 days. ... This is not justice for Jayland Walker. ... Police do not keep us safe. We keep us safe. This is exactly why we need a civilian review board, which is just the first step in moving toward a world where there is real accountability and justice and where every one of us can life full and healthy lives, no exceptions.""

Jayland Walker's family, attorney react to officers returning to work

Walker family attorney Bobby DiCello retweeted the Freedom BLOC statement to his Twitter followers.

Beacon Journal news partner News 5 Cleveland said Ken Abbarno and DiCello, the Walker family attorneys, released the following statement in which they said the officers should be placed back on leave:

""The planning behind the decision to reinstate the police officers involved in this summer’s tragic killing of Jayland Walker is callous and ignores the Walker family’s needs for a fair process.

Advertisement Advertisement

""The decision to reinstate these officers — even to desk duty — fails to take into account a pending investigation into their actions that culminated in Jayland’s brutal shooting and unjustifiable death resulting from a barrage of more than 90 bullets. This decision undermines the legitimacy of the investigative process the Walker family has been asked to follow and which BCI has led to this point. On behalf of the Walker family, we call on the City of Akron to do the right thing and place the officers back on leave until the investigation has been completed.""

Police department's reasoning for bringing officers back

The police department said it ""consulted"" with ""various community leaders and other stakeholders"" in recent weeks before bringing the eight officers back to work. Mylett said two advisory councils — one made up of community leaders and another consisting of pastors and others in the religious community — agreed independently from one another that the decision to return the eight officers to work ""was the right decision for this moment.""

""The consensus of these conversations was an agreement that this step would provide needed relief and support to ensure there are no interruptions in the services we provide to the community,"" the police department said.

The Ohio Attorney General’s Office and the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation are continuing to conduct an investigation. The case then will be submitted to the Summit County grand jury. The police department's Office of Professional Standards and Accountability will also conduct a separate internal investigation, with the results given to Mylett and the Akron police auditor for their review.

Kalani Smith, 24, from Nashville, Tennessee, has 2.2 million followers on TikTok, where he shares videos of his paranormal investigations, including his recent trip to Denton, Texas.

Last month, he spent the night at Old Alton Bridge, an eerie landmark better known as 'Goatman's Bridge' thanks to local lore about a half-man, half-goat creature that haunts the area.

Ghost hunter Kalani Smith, 24, from Nashville, Tennessee, recently visited Old Alton Bridge in Denton, Texas, which is better known as 'Goatman's Bridge'

Smith has 2.2 million followers on TikTok, where he shares videos of his paranormal investigations, including his investigation of the historic bridge last month

'This is rumored to be one of the most haunted places in all of America, and its dark history could really feed into that,' Smith explained in his now-viral video, which has been viewed more than 17.1 million times.

The bridge is believed to be linked to the horrifying death of an African American goat farmer named Oscar Washburn, who was said to have settled with his family near the bridge in the 1930s.

Washburn became known as the 'Goatman' because of how he earned his living, but he was allegedly lynched by local members of the Ku Klux Klan after he posted a sign on the bridge that said 'This way to the Goatman.'

According to legend, the Klansmen kidnapped Washburn in August 1938. They secured a noose around his neck that was attached to the bridge before throwing him over the side.

'This is rumored to be one of the most haunted places in all of America, and its dark history could really feed into that,' Smith explained in his now-viral video

According to local legend, an African American goat farmer named Oscar Washburn was lynched by local members of the Ku Klux Klan on the bridge in 1938

When the Klansmen looked down to see if he was dead, the rope was empty and his body was never recovered. They then allegedly went to his home and murdered his wife and children

However, when they looked down to see if he was dead, the rope was empty and his body was never recovered. In a panic, the Klansmen went to his home and murdered his wife and children.

Since the alleged murder, locals have reported creepy experiences and sightings at the bridge. Some believe that the Goatman haunts the location, ready to exact his revenge.

Knocking on the bridge three times or driving over it with your vehicle's headlights turned off is said to be enough to summon the spirit.

Others think it is shrouded in evil due to satanic rituals that are still allegedly being performed underneath the bridge and the surrounding area.

When word got out that Smith was visiting Goatman's bridge, dozens of people joined him as he livestreamed his investigation.

A follow-up video from the night shows them all knocking on the bridge at the same time in an attempt set a record for the number of people knocking on the landmark at midnight.

'Once my presence was known at the bridge, hundreds of people showed up, and we had someone fire rounds at us from the road nearby,' Smith told Need To Know.

The paranormal expert also claimed that he may be haunted by the Goatman himself after spending a night at the location.

'After my visit to Goatman's Bridge, a variety of psychics have seen an attachment on me that resembled a goat-man figure,' he explained. 'What's interesting about this is some of these people didn't even know that I ventured to Goatman's Bridge.

'This gets even weirder because on [my other] investigations after Goatman's Bridge, the name Goatman keeps coming through my equipment, and I get activity when I mention his name.

'The last thing I found a little spooky is that the location is still used for dark ritualistic practices to this day,' he added.

'A group of three individuals had items that I had never seen before, and they disappeared into the woods to perform a ritual.'

Smith, who also explored the nearby woods, alleged that 'the location is still used for dark ritualistic practices to this day'

He claimed that he saw a group of three individuals head into the forest carrying items he didn't recognize to perform a ritual when he was there

'Even if nothing paranormal was attached to this bridge, you would still need to exercise caution from the people that show up,' he explained

Smith said that ghost hunters should be cautious when visiting the bridge, explaining that the structure and surrounding forest present more than just ghostly dangers.

'Even if nothing paranormal was attached to this bridge, you would still need to exercise caution from the people that show up,' he explained.

Smith admitted that he didn't see the infamous Goatman, but he did detect some electromagnetic field (EMF) activity on the bridge.

He also heard strange noises coming from the woods while with his team.

'It was hard to determine if this was paranormal or people, but it still had a very eerie feeling and it definitely seems like there's some sort of presence,' he said.

'After venturing through the woods, we found weird markings and animal carcasses, this could potentially be from the ritualistic practices.'

Smith's videos documenting the visit creeped out a number of viewers on TikTok.

'All I can hear is ""I am on your bridge GOATMAN,""' one person wrote, while another added: 'Not me having a family photo shoot on that bridge.'

https://www.abc15.com/news/state/us-medal-of-honor-recipient-hiroshi-miyamura-dies-at-97,US Medal of Honor recipient Hiroshi Miyamura dies at 97,"PHOENIX — Hiroshi ""Hershey"" Miyamura, the son of Japanese immigrants who was awarded the U.S. Medal of Honor for holding off an attack to allow an American squad to withdraw during the Korean War, has died.

The Congressional Medal of Honor Society announced that Miyamura died Tuesday at his home in Phoenix. He was 97.

Born in Gallup, New Mexico, Miyamura's parents operated a 24-hour diner near the Navajo Nation where the family interacted with the diverse population of miners and travelers who passed along Route 66.

Miyamura's mother died when he was 11 and his father never talked about Japan, Miyamura said in later interviews. He would earn the nickname ""Hershey"" because a teacher couldn't pronounce his first name.

Miyamura worked as an auto mechanic during high school. He joined the U.S. Army late in World War II after the federal government lifted restrictions on Japanese Americans serving. Miyamura was allowed to join the 442nd Infantry Regiment, composed almost entirely of ""nisei"" — those born in the U.S. to parents who were Japanese immigrants.

After the war, Miyamura met Terry Tsuchimori, a woman from a family who had been forced to live at the Poston internment camp in southwestern Arizona following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. They married in 1948 and had three children.

Miyamura continued to serve in the Army Reserves and was called into action during the Korean War.

On the night of April 24, 1951, near Taejon-ni, Miyamura's company came under attack by an invading Chinese force. Miyamura ordered his squad to retreat while he stayed behind and continued to fight, giving his men enough time to evacuate.

Miyamura and fellow squad leader Joseph Lawrence Annello, of Castle Rock, Colorado, were captured. Though wounded, Miyamura carried the injured Annello for miles until Chinese soldiers ordered him at gunpoint to leave Annello by the side of a road. Miyamura refused the orders until Annello convinced him to put him down.

Annello was later picked up by another Chinese unit and taken to a POW camp, from which he escaped.

Miyamura was held as a prisoner for two years and four months.

Upon his release, he was presented the Medal of Honor by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It had been awarded in secret while he was still a prisoner of war.

""I never ever thought I would receive the Medal of Honor for doing my duty, which I thought that's all I was doing, was my duty,"" Miyamura said in the 2018 Netflix documentary ""Medal of Honor.""

Miyamura and Annello later met up and remained lifelong friends. Annello died in 2018.

After the Korean War, Miyamura returned to Gallup as a hero. More than 5,000 people came to meet his train. He spent much of the rest of his life working in town as an auto mechanic.

In his Living History documentary in the Congressional Medal of Honor Society library, Miyamura reflected on the soldiers who deserved recognition but never received it.

""There are so many Americans who don't know what the Medal represents or what any soldier or servicewoman or man does for his country. And I believe one of these days — I hope one of these days — they will learn of the sacrifices that a lot of the men and women have made for this country,"" he said.

Miyamura remained active in veterans' issues and gave annual summer lectures to military members in Gallup, New Mexico. The talks drew hundreds of servicemen and servicewomen over the years.

In 2019, an aide announced that Miyamura had likely given his last public talk due to declining health.

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Navajo Nation Vice President Myron Lizer both called Miyamura a hero, saying he will be missed by many who are forever grateful for his service.

Miyamura is survived by numerous family members. Funeral arrangements are pending.",Q4

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.""

Netflix just released another installation of the streaming network’s Crime Scene docuseries, and it’s an intense one. Over the course of three episodes, Crime Scene: The Texas Killing Fields tells the true story of the unsolved murders of several young women that occurred in Texas between 1984 and 1991.

The docuseries details how the bodies of victims were dumped in an oil field, called the Calder Road oil field, that was part of a 50-mile stretch of highway-adjacent land connecting Houston, Texas, to nearby Galveston, Texas. In fact, so many bodies were found along the miles and miles of land over the years that the area was dubbed ""The Killing Fields.""

The show dives into the lives and deaths of four victims: Heidi Villareal Fye, Laura Miller, Audrey Lee Cook, and Donna Prudhomme. But more than 30 bodies—of mostly young women and girls—were found in ""The Killing Fields"" between 1971 and 1999, per The New Zealand Herald, The Washington Post, and CBS News. This has raised a lot of questions about who, exactly, is behind these murders. Here’s what you need to know.

Who are the suspects?

Detectives worked hard to find potential suspects over the years, but they've struggled to get anywhere, the documentary shows. Plus, there are no known witnesses for the four Calder Road field murders, the FBI reported back in 2019.

The first major suspect was a felon who falsely confessed to the Calder Road oil field murders from jail in 2001, according to The Washington Post. Another suspect was a man who owned a horse stable in a nearby lot. However, there wasn’t enough evidence to press charges against either one.

A man named Clyde Hedrick, who was found guilty of murdering another woman, Ellen Beason, in the area, is still a suspect, according to Bustle. An assistant district attorney actually says in the docuseries that Hedrick confessed to murdering Fye, and raping and murdering Miller, but Hedrick has publicly stated (in a letter to The Guardian) that he’s innocent. While there's not enough evidence to prove the case, the District Attorney says he hasn’t been ruled out as a suspect just yet.

Another man, William Reece, recently confessed to murder in three other cold-cases linked to the ""Killing Fields,"" per Click2Houston and the New York Post.

Have any killers been caught?

There have been several arrests in connection to the scores of murders that took place along the ""Killing Fields.""

Kevin Edison Smith: Smith was arrested in 2012 for the murder of 13-year-old Krystal Jean Baker, 16 years after her death, according to Newsweek. Baker’s dress was submitted for a DNA analysis, and it matched Smith, who was arrested for a minor drug offense in 2010. He was sentenced to life in jail.

John Robert King and Gerald Peter Zwarst: King told police in 1987 that he killed 19-year-old Shelley Sikes while she was in her car, per Newsweek. He also said that he raped and murdered her with the help of Zwarst. Both men died in prison.

William Lewis Reece: Reece was arrested in 1997 for the kidnapping and attempted murder of 19-year-old Sandra Sapaugh, Click2Houston reports. (She escaped by jumping out of his truck as he drove down a highway.) His DNA matched the evidence in the death of 19-year-old Tiffany Johnson back in 2015. Johnson was murdered in Oklahoma in 1997. Reece confessed to killing Jessica Cain, 17, and Kelli Cox, 20.

Where is Clyde Hedrick now?

Hedrick was released on parole in 2021, even though he allegedly told jailhouse informants that he killed several other people, including Fye and Miller, Click2Houston reports.

It's unclear where exactly he is now. But, one of the ""Killing Fields"" victims' dads, Tim Miller, has been investigating Hedrick in relation to his daughter's death, even visiting his old house in Florida, speaking to Hedrick's ex-wife, and cleaning out his home, per USA Today.

Where is William Reece now?

Reece is in jail and has been transferred to Texas, where he has pleaded guilty to the murders of Cain, Cox, and Laura Smither, per Click2Houston. He received a life sentence for each of the three cases, The New York Post reported.

So, who is the killer?

There's no quick answer to this one. Since there were so many bodies found along the stretch of land, there are likely many different people involved. Several suspects have been convicted or charged in different cases over the years, and other names have also been put forward without evidence to support any charges, per Newsweek.

Want to read our e-Edition? Here are some tips for getting the best experience.

Frits van Eeden, an artist who splashed color and creativity across Brevard for more than 40 years, died Sept. 30 in the Netherlands. He was 78.

""He just elevated the whole art community,"" said Melbourne artist Renee Decator. ""He was an encourager for sure. Young artists, older artists, it didn't matter.""

Born in Tilburg in the Netherlands, van Eeden was invited to join the Pulchri Art Society of The Hague and studied painting and sculpture. While on a visit to Florida in 1979, he entered two life-size sculptures of horses into a juried competition at the Artist Forum of the Brevard Art Center and Museum of Melbourne. He won best-in-show, and Brevard County won his heart of and loyalty.

For the next 43 years, van Eeden lived and worked on the Space Coast, creating art, fostering the talent of other artists and supporting numerous non-profit organizations.

""He was very inspirational for the Brevard community,"" said longtime friend Arsenio Lobosco. ""He never asked for anything, but he was a very giving person. He always donated paintings to all kinds of causes in Melbourne or in Florida.""

Darcia Jones Francey, a native Brevardian and philanthropist, agreed.

""Frits was the most prolific artist in Brevard County. He was the most loved artist in Brevard County, and he was the most generous artist in Brevard County.""

Van Eeden donated countless paintings and sculptures to various charities, and frequently turned his work into performance art, painting on stage at Brevard Symphony Orchestra concerts and Sheriff Wayne Ivey's Dancing for the Space Coast fundraiser.

In 2003, he moved into the Brevard Museum of Art and Science, which later became the now-defunct Foosaner Art Museum, for a week. He slept, ate and painted at the museum for a week. The resulting works were auctioned off at a cocktail party to support the museum.

The list of organizations benefiting from his talent included the Brevard Humane Society, Habitat for Humanity of Brevard, Sally's House, Prevent of Brevard, the Foosaner Art Museum, the Women's Center, Health First and the King Center for the Performing Arts.

""Passage,"" a 22-foot steel and glass sculpture he donated to the Foosaner in 2015, now resides at the Ruth Funk Center on the Florida Tech campus.

More:22-foot sculpture installed at Foosaner Art Museum

Those who knew van Eeden loved him for more than his talent and giving nature.

""He was one of the most tender souls I've ever met,"" said Pam Harbaugh, who wrote about the arts for FLORIDA TODAY for more than two decades. ""It was a real joy knowing him. He was just very kind and very patient and extremely dedicated to his art and to the artistry of others. He liked to champion other people's artistic expressions and the work that they did.""

Decator learned that firsthand. She already was a working painter selling her art when she met van Eeden.

""When I came to Brevard 27 years ago, I had never heard of Frits,"" she said. ""A couple of friends said Frits was returning to town. Everybody was talking about him.""

She met him at the Art Students Guild in downtown Melbourne and decided to attend a demonstration he was conducting at the Eau Gallie Library.

""It was, for an artist, sort of life-changing,"" she said. She came from a background with strict rules. Van Eeden followed his own rules.

""He started this painting from a big, white, blank canvas,"" she said, ""and he started slopping paint on it. Everybody was quiet. I think it started making him nervous. He started painting behind his back.""

Within an hour, he had created a beautiful still life.

""I thought, 'This is just fun.' I decided I wanted to have this kind of experience when I was painting,"" she said.

Decator said she's grateful for foundation she received in her early years as a painter, but she credits van Eeden with teaching her to express herself.

""He really forced me to loosen up,"" she said. ""He made me so much more comfortable exploring. He gave me the freedom to make mistakes.""

Van Eeden split his time between Florida and his native country, but he moved back to the Netherlands for good this summer.

""I survived bone cancer. And I'm 77 in the meantime. I just want to spend some time with my family,"" Van Eeden said, in a June 2021 interview with FLORIDA TODAY about his ""Fare Thee Well"" exhibition at Upside Gallery in downtown Melbourne.

Van Eeden was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a bone marrow cancer, in 2012. He received treatment in the Netherlands and said he had been cancer-free for about two years.

Harbaugh and Decator both described van Eeden as a charismatic man who drew people to him.

""Everybody who ran into him would always want a hug,"" Decator said. ""He is really going to be missed.""

Harbaugh talked about his hugs, too.

""He was bigger than life, and you just wanted to be in his embrace all the time,"" Harbaugh said. ""You can say that both literally and figuratively. That embrace was a metaphor for his spirit.""

Francey hosted birthday luncheons for van Eeden every March at Dove III in Melbourne.

Harbaugh was at the last birthday celebration this spring.

""He sat there amidst probably two dozen adoring women, of whom I was one,"" she said. ""He was quiet. He smiled. You could tell how he felt so beloved. And he was so beloved.""

Francey said she'll miss those luncheons, and she'll miss her friend.

""He gave from his heart,"" she said. ""He never applied strings. He loved his family, his friends, his colleagues and his adopted community of Brevard County.""

CNN, WDSU

By Nouran Salahieh, Holly Yan, Monica Garrett and Brandon Miller, CNN

The massive storm system that pulverized homes, killed three people in Louisiana and brought blizzard conditions to northern states will inflict a new wave of brutal weather starting Thursday.

Significant ice and heavy snow will smother parts of the Mid-Atlantic and New England, forecasters said.

Ice storm warnings are in effect for the central Appalachians of western Virginia, eastern West Virginia, the Maryland Panhandle and parts of central and western Pennsylvania — where up to a quarter inch to a half inch of ice could stack up by Thursday evening.

Already, freezing rain and snow are covering parts of the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic. A quarter inch of ice was reported Thursday morning in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia and Maryland, and about a tenth of an inch had built up in parts of Virginia.

And over the next two days, 6 to 12 inches of snow could pile up from central Pennsylvania northward to upstate New York. Places with higher elevations could get walloped with up to 2 feet of snow.

The intense snowfall will spread into interior New England on Friday, with up to a foot expected there.

The mammoth storm system that plowed across much of the country this week will morph into a nor’easter that will spread ice, snow and rain to the Northeast.

Major cities including New York and Boston will likely get doused with 1 to 2 inches of rain into the weekend from the nor’easter. Winter weather advisories are in effect for Baltimore, Washington and Philadelphia due to the possibility of freezing rain.

‘More devastating than initially expected’

The tornado that shredded much of Gretna, Louisiana, on Wednesday may have damaged up to 5,000 structures, the mayor said.

“Unfortunately, now that the sun is up, it is more devastating than initially expected,” Mayor Belinda Constant said Thursday.

“There are more houses that will probably have to be condemned or just demolished based on such damage,” she said. “It’s about a mile-and-a-half stretch that is completely just inundated with destruction.”

Despite the devastation in Gretna, only three injuries were reported, the mayor said. “This is not the place where we normally have tornadoes. So our reality of a safe house is not what it is in other parts of the country. But people survived in bathtubs,” she said.

“We’re a resilient people and this is the type of thing that don’t choose locations.”

Widespread power outages in the cold

From tornadoes in the South to blizzard conditions in the Upper Midwest, more than 130,000 homes, businesses and other electricity customers in the US had no power Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us.

Most of those outages — about 115,000 — were in Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota. Ferocious winds from blizzard conditions knocked down power lines in the Upper Midwest, and temperatures in some areas without power plunged to near or below freezing.

In the South, which was hit by multiple tornadoes, about 10,000 power customers were in the dark Thursday morning. About 9,000 outages were reported in Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia.

A mother and child were killed and found far from their home

The same storm system now slamming eastern states left a trail of devastation in Gulf Coast states.

At least 50 tornado reports have been made since Tuesday in Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, Texas Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma.

At least three deaths in Louisiana have been linked to the storm.

Yoshiko A. Smith, 30, and her 8-year-old son, Nikolus Little, were killed Tuesday when a tornado struck Caddo Parish and destroyed their home, local officials said.

Their bodies were found far from where their house once stood, officials said. Autopsies have been ordered for both, the county coronor said.

In St. Charles Parish, a 56-year-old woman died after a tornado hit her home, the Louisiana Department of Health said Wednesday.

In Texas, a tornado struck Wise County near Paradise and Decatur on Tuesday, officials said. Video showed homes splintered, with roofs ripped off in Decatur.

And in Wayne, Oklahoma, a tornado damaged homes and barns Tuesday, officials said. No injuries were reported, but homes were flattened or had roofs torn off, according to footage from CNN affiliate KOCO.

‘All we could hear was glass popping everywhere’

In the Louisiana town of Farmerville, at least 20 people were injured when a tornado struck Union Parish on Tuesday night — demolishing parts of an apartment complex and a mobile home park, Farmerville police Detective Cade Nolan said.

Patsy Andrews was home with her children in Farmerville when she heard “rushing wind like a train” outside, she told CNN affiliate KNOE-TV.

Her son told her not to open the door when she went to investigate. But it was too late.

“All of a sudden that wind was so heavy, it broke my back door,” Andrews said. “The lights went off and all we could hear was glass popping everywhere.”

Andrews said she and her daughter hit the floor, crawling into a hallway as glass shattered around them and water leaked through the roof. They ended up hunkering down in their bathroom.

“We just got in the tub and we hugged each other. We just kept praying and I just kept calling on Jesus,” Andrews said. Her family survived the storm but was left with a damaged home.

A tornado reportedly touched down in New Iberia, damaging several homes, the New Iberia Police Department said.

Iberia Medical Center “sustained a significant amount of damage,” police Capt. Leland Laseter said on Facebook. CNN has sought comment from the medical center.

In Jefferson Parish, Councilman Scott Walker said he saw at least a mile-long path of debris.

“Power lines down, homes severely damaged, rooftops ripped off,” he said in a video shared online describing the scene. “It is an extensive damage scene and a long path of destruction here on the west bank.”

And in Arabi, Louisiana, Cindy DeLucca Hernandez thought she could beat the storm while driving home with her 16-year-old son after school. Then she found herself facing a tornado.

Hernandez shared video with CNN that showed a tornado blowing through Arabi, kicking up debris and taking out power lines.

“We started seeing debris and we got hit a couple of times by it,” she said. “That’s when I put the car in reverse.”

Hernandez and her son made it home safely.

But “it was extremely scary,” Hernandez said. “I’ve never ever been through anything like that.”

Leilani Simon, 22, was supposedly high on drugs when she used an unidentified object to beat her two-year-old son which caused 'serious bodily injury' and led to his death, prosecutors revealed on Wednesday.

The mother of three was under the influence had met with her drug dealer right before the October murder, according to the indictment charges. The 22-year-old then dumped his body at the Azalea Mobile Home Park.

She previously told police that her son was abducted by an intruder who broke into her Savannah home. Leilani was arrested in November but investigators haven't disclosed the details that led to her arrest.

Leilani was indicted on 19 counts and faces charges including malice murder, felony murder, concealment of death and making false statements to police about Quinton's death.

Leilani Simon, 22, was 'high on drugs' when she beat her two-year-old son with an unidentified object which lead to his death in October

Quinton Simon's remains were found in a Georgia landfill on November 18, and Leilani was arrested three days later

Leilani reported her son missing from her home on October 5, but Chatham County Police Chief believed she was the suspect since the start of the investigation, according to Fox News.

A Chatham County grand jury handed down the indictment against Leilani on Wednesday after discovering Quinton's missing body in a Georgia landfill on November 18 - three days after Leilani was arrested.

It says that Leilani 'did maliciously cause her son, Quinton Simon, a human being and a child under the age of 18 years, cruel and excessive physical pain... and the accused did, in the commission of this offense cause Quinton's death,' WJLC reports.

The mother of three faces charges of malice murder, felony murder, concealment of death and making false statements to police

The indictment revealed that Leilani left her Buckhaulter house on October 4 to meet her drug dealer and left the next morning on October 5 to dump his body.

Quinton was last seen alive on October 5 by Leliani's boyfriend, Daniel Youngkin, who saw him in a pack-n-play at 6am.

Three hours later, Leilani reported Quinton missing from her home. She claimed to have woken up at 9.30am and found the door of the house open with her son gone.

'These are the cases that keep us up at night, these are the cases that need justice,' District Attorney Shalena Cook Jones said in a news conference on Wednesday.

'We have the evidence to bring these charges because of the hard work of the investigators, agents and rangers who worked on this case.'

She added that the criminal investigation is ongoing, and would not disclose what evidence police have found that led to Leilani's arrest.

Chatham County District Attorney Shalena Cook Jones would not disclose what evidence officers have received that led to Leilani's indictment and said the case is ongoing

Leilani was spotted with Billie Jo Betterton Howell, her mother, at Sting Ray's, a beach bar near Tybee Island, drinking tequila about two weeks after Quinton went missing.

DailyMail.com revealed that the two were at the bar downing Patron shots for three hours.

Prior to her arrest and following weeks of media scrutiny, Leilani had checked herself into a treatment center, according to a report.

When she informed her mother that she was planning to check herself out of the program, it was Howell who made the decision to let the FBI know her daughter's next move.

'Her mother had to make one of the hardest decisions of her life, and call the FBI agents and let them know that she was signing herself out,' said a family friend who has been staying with Howell since Quinton's disappearance.

The friend said that Howell at the request of the FBI, retrieved Leilani from the treatment center and spent the latter's last few free hours with her.

She then took her daughter to the Savannah FBI office where she was ultimately arrested and charged with her son's murder.

Billie Jo Howell, 45, had custody of young Quinton Simon, when he was reported missing on October 5. She was away at the time, and the boy was staying with his mother

Howell was arrested Monday on Contempt of Court charges and is now on suicide prevention watch at the Chatham County detention center

Before Quinton died, Leilani had lost child custody of Quinton for an unknown reason.

Quinton was in Howell's custody before he went missing, but she was out of town when he disappeared.

Howell was also arrested Monday on Contempt of Court charges unrelated to Quinton's case and is now on suicide prevention watch at the Chatham County detention center after she claimed she 'lost everything.'

Leilani's two other children were removed from her custody a week after Quinton was reported missing.

She has pleaded not guilty to the charges filed against her and will appear in court on January 11.",Q4

SEATTLE — After the University District in Seattle saw an uptick in crime, some students were left wondering who else lived near them.

A man is accused of breaking into a University of Washington (UW) student’s home and assaulting her early Sunday morning. Police are still searching for him.

“That's really scary because it was just up the block from us,"" said Maddy Jenson, a UW student. ""That could have easily been our house.""

Last week, another Seattle man was arrested for the brutal murder of an Indigenous woman. Court documents show he lives on the same street as Sunday’s break-in.

Following the recent crimes, one student decided to learn more about who was living in the area.

""I did a national predator registry search to see how many registered sex offenders live in this area and there's like 25 within a mile of my house, which put me even more on edge,” said Kevin Baker, a UW student.

There are 10 registered sex offenders living on the 4700 block of 18th Ave NE, according to the National Sex Offender Public Website.

The man accused of killing Mavis Nelson is not one of them.

The street is filled with college students and Greek life housing.

“They can easily find a way in and just being so close to home it's like do I even want to go out tonight and you're looking over your shoulder going to class because you just never know,” Jenson said.

While it's near a university, most sex offenders are free to live where they want.

“I'm not aware of anything in our laws, the revised code of Washington or any municipal or county status that would prohibit that,” said Capt. Tim Meyer with the King County Sheriff’s Office (KCSO).

The sheriff’s office said there are instances where sex offenders live in the same house or area.

Records show most of the offenders living on the 4700 block of 18th Ave. NE are Level 2 or Level 3, meaning they have a risk to re-offend.

The King County Sheriff’s Office oversees offender compliance with housed and unhoused offenders.

Unhoused Level 2 and 3 offenders must check in with the sheriff’s office weekly. Housed offenders must check in less so.

“If you're a Level 1 sex offender, you’re going to see the sheriff’s office at least once a year, Level 2 will be checked every six months, Level 3 will be done quarterly by one of our commission members,” Meyer said.

According to the Department of Corrections (DOC), two offenders have been approved to live on the street through court-ordered supervision.

The DOC said it will approve an address that ensures they are not housed in violation of their court-ordered or DOC-imposed conditions or placed somewhere at the risk of reoffending.

The DOC requires supervised individuals to report to the department at least once a month but it could be upwards of three or more times a month depending on their assessed risk level.

The KCSO assists with offender assessment.

The DOC said it has no information about previous issues with UW students on that street.

“I understand the frustration of folks and the concern you have,"" Meyer said. ""Those that have children who are in college or about to be in college this causes us pause and understandably so.""

A UW spokesperson released a statement that read:

“Under state law, sex offenders who are meeting the terms of their parole or release may reside where they choose, as long as they register. The University of Washington is aware that there are registered sex offenders living in the areas around the Seattle campus, and we understand this can cause concern in the community. The UW has no jurisdiction or ability to limit their proximity to campus. Anyone perceiving a threat or in an emergency should call 911 immediately.”

The KCSO is encouraging people to be vigilant and check its sex offender registry to be mindful of who lives nearby.

Seattle police have added emphasis patrols to the U District neighborhood from Wednesday to Sunday.

LOUIS — A boy shot in his hands, with a bullet lodged in his jaw, escaped the St. Louis school attack Monday by jumping out a window and scaling a fence, his aunt said.

Brian Collins, 15, was released from the hospital Tuesday night.

“The bullet to his jaw was centimeters from a major artery, so it’s truly an act of God that he didn’t die and didn’t require surgery,” Brian’s godmother and aunt, Stephanie Malia Krauss, told the Post-Dispatch on Wednesday.

Shortly after 9 a.m. Monday, a gunman armed with an AR-15-style rifle burst into Brian’s health class at Central Visual and Performing Arts High School in south St. Louis.

The gunman, Orlando Harris, fatally shot Brian’s teacher, Jean Kuczka. The teacher stepped in front of the gunman to protect her students, Kuczka’s daughter was told.

Gunfire hit Brian’s hands and his face.

“A heroic student somehow opened the window in the middle of all of that, and that is how Brian was able to get out,” Krauss said.

Funeral plans for Jean Kuczka Jean Kuczka, 61, the St. Louis teacher killed Monday in a school shooting will be buried next week, according to a local funeral home. The funeral will take place at Kutis Funeral Home at 9 a.m. Monday, followed by a funeral Mass at Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis at 10 a.m. The educator who taught health, personal finance and physical education in St. Louis and St. Louis County schools is survived by her husband, two sons and three daughters. One of her sons is a Eureka police officer. She also had six grandchildren.

The rampage killed Kuczka and 15-year-old Alexzandria Bell, who was found dead in a hallway. Authorities haven’t said if the shooter, killed by police, was targeting victims or firing randomly.

Brian was treated at St. Louis Children’s Hospital and is home recuperating, Krauss said. He has a long recovery ahead. The bullet remains in his jaw.

Krauss has organized a GoFundMe to raise money for Brian’s family, to help cover his immediate and long-term medical costs and other expenses, such as clothes that are easy to pull on and occupational therapy. Brian’s long-term recovery needs are undetermined, Krauss said.

In addition to Brian, police said two other 15-year-old boys suffered gunshot wounds, including one boy who underwent surgery. A bullet grazed a 16-year-old girl. Police have not released updates on the injured. Two more students had abrasions, and one broke an ankle.

The student who opened the window in the third-floor health class was among the shooting victims; he is a 15-year-old boy who is Brian’s friend, Krauss said.

Brian transferred to Central high school earlier this fall. His mom, older brother and older sister all graduated from Central, which is at Arsenal Street and South Kingshighway near Tower Grove Park. Central shares a campus with Collegiate School of Medicine and Bioscience.

Brian came to Central because of his love of art. Brian is an incredible artist with pencil charcoal drawings showing fine details, Krauss said.

“He has both arms in splints from the fingers all the way up past the elbow,” she said. “There’s no way of knowing the extent of the injuries until follow-up appointments and the swelling goes down. We’re not going to know for a couple of weeks.”

Brian also is considering a culinary career. His signature dish is cheesecake.

“In our house, he is the pancake flipper and the egg maker,” Krauss joked.

Another of Brian’s hobbies that takes finger dexterity is gaming. He worked at the science center over the summer and saved money to buy gaming equipment.

Krauss said her son, 9, thinks Brian is a superhero for his escape out a window and over a fence after being shot.

Police rushed into the school minutes after getting the “active shooter” call, confronted Harris on the third floor and killed him in an exchange of gunfire. Police said Harris, 19, was a former student who left behind notes describing himself as a loner with no friends. Authorities haven’t said where Harris got the gun or the 600 rounds of ammunition.",Q4

The Jamestown City Council on Monday, Nov. 7, read the first reading of an ordinance to amend the district map to change the zoning of a general multiple dwelling district to a local commercial district where Dollar General plans to locate at 424 4th Ave. NE.

Dollar General requested a change in zoning to a local commercial district to allow for the construction of a new retail store. The property affected is lot 1, block 1 of the Hope Apostlic Addition.

The zoning change is contingent on the removal of an access from 4th Avenue Northeast. If the zoning change is approved, the removal of the access would not apply to the next tenant of the lot.

Homer Township residents concerned about sizes of lots

Property owners in Homer Township are concerned with the size of the lots near their neighborhood that a property owner wants to sell.

A request to the Homer Township Board to deny a replat of a lot in Homer Township brought up questions about density and character of an area on Wednesday, Nov. 2, at Homer Township Hall. Rickie Poseley, a resident of Homer Township who lives in Buchholtz Ranch Subdivision, said a majority of homeowners who live in close proximity to lot 1 of the Buchholtz Ranch Subdivision, which is the RR Qual Acres Subdivision, oppose the replat of the property that is divided into 14 5-acre lots.

The RR Qual Acres Subdivision maps have been plotted and recorded at the Stutsman County Courthouse, said Nancy Thompson, clerk/treasurer of Homer Township.

Discussions were held on how Homer Township residents could work on changing the township’s ordinance by defining low density and character of neighborhoods.

The minimum lot size in Homer Township is 5 acres, according to its zoning ordinance.

Poseley said the Quals purchased their property in 1994, three years after the Buchholtz Ranch Subdivision was established. She said the density of the established neighborhood in the Buchholtz Ranch Subdivision and Buchholtz Ranch Second Subdivision is about 12 acres.

She said the established low-density neighborhood is protected by the North Dakota Century Code, Stutsman County’s zoning ordinance, Homer Township’s zoning ordinance and residential area covenants for Buchholtz Ranch Subdivision.

Lawsuit filed against Jamestown man in fatal crash

A wrongful death lawsuit has been filed in U.S. District Court in Fargo against a 78-year-old Jamestown man who was driving a pickup that struck and killed a 20-year-old man riding a bicycle in June about 10 miles north of Jamestown.

James Charles Lees is accused of negligence and wrongful conduct that resulted in the death of Timothy Wayne St. John, 20, North Brook, Illinois, according to the complaint filed by Jeffrey and Julie St. John on Monday, Nov. 7. The lawsuit states Jeffrey and Julie St. John are demanding a jury trial and damages of $150,000 or more.

Timothy St. John was riding a bicycle southbound on N.D. Highway 20 near mile marker 10.5 shortly after 12:30 p.m. June 19, while Lees, who was driving a 2016 Chevrolet Silverado southbound on Highway 20, failed to yield to the bicycle and struck the rear tire, pushing the bicycle and rider into the west ditch, the North Dakota Highway Patrol said in a news release about the accident in June.

The patrol said Lees left the scene but returned and located the cyclist. The cyclist was declared dead at the scene after emergency personnel arrived.

No citations were issued by the patrol.

Serving in military opens up other opportunities for veteran

Veterans Day is about honoring veterans and the U.S. flag for a Goodrich, North Dakota, native who was a school teacher when he was 19 years old before he was drafted into the U.S. Army.

Warren Papke, 92, who now resides in Jamestown, hoped to see the American flag flying in everybody’s yard on Veterans Day, Nov. 11.

“When you look at that, you think of freedom, you think of the men and women that didn’t come home,” he said. “You think of the ones that are crippled. It was not in vain. It was freedom.”

Papke was drafted at age 20 in 1951 during the Korean War. After his training at Fort Riley in Kansas, he served two years in Big Delta, Alaska, during the Korean War. At that time, Alaska was not a U.S. state yet, so he was able to say he served overseas.

Papke became a chaplain’s assistant.

""People I know who work for the government are normally given government phones and computers and they have devices that they're only expected to use for work performance. But as is often the case, they get a brief, [and then] they look at it as a free phone and often use it for their personal reasons,"" Thomas W. Pauken II, author of 'US vs China: From Trade War to Reciprocal Deal' and Beijing-based consultant on Asia-Pacific affairs and geopolitical commentator, told Sputnik. ""From a certain angle, it is understandable that they shouldn't really be using Tik Tok on their government devices.""The No TikTok on Government Devices Act came after half a dozen US states enacted bans on the use of the app by state employees. Last month, Kristi Noem, a Republican governor of South Dakota, banned TikTok on state government devices with GOP governors in Maryland, Texas, and South Carolina following suit.The aforementioned Republican state officials claimed that China uses information that it ""gathers"" on TikTok to ""manipulate"" the American people. TikTok is owned by Chinese company ByteDance which is currently headquartered in Singapore. According to the US press, US armed forces have also blocked the app from their military gadgets.On December 8, TikTok issued an official statement, announcing that it is creating ""a Trust & Safety team within US Data Security (USDS) to build further trust and confidence in the protection of US user data and compliance.""""The newly created USDS Trust and Safety team will work on compliance, safety strategies, and moderation for content involving US users' private data,"" the statement said.The US media also quoted the TikTok leadership as saying that they store all US user data in the US with a backup in Singapore.Nonetheless, cross-party US senators came up with the anti-TikTok bill which is now set to be discussed in the House of Representatives. The lower chamber would need to pass the Senate bill before the current congressional session ends. Only after that, the legislation will go to US President Joe Biden's desk. Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, tried to ban the app altogether in the US during his presidential tenure.Pauken suggested that a TikTok ban obviously comes in handy for US Silicon Valley giants, which could fill the Chinese app's niche if it is prohibited altogether in the US.At the same time, TikTok's ban could also be seen as part of a broader crackdown on China's tech companies by Washington. The trend started under then-President Donald Trump, who pushed for blacklisting dozens of major Chinese telecom companies, including Huawei. Joe Biden went further by restricting Chinese firms from getting leading-edge semiconductor technologies and expertise from western producers.In August 2022, the US passed the CHIPS and Science Act which has been described by western observers as a new US policy of ""actively strangling large segments of the Chinese technology industry.""For his part, Pauken remarked that the Chinese and US industries have long become intertwined, with Beijing exercising huge leverage over technology supply chains given its rare earth reserves.The People's Republic not only boasts one of the largest mineral reserves, but it also produces around 85% of the world's rare earths. According to the 2022 US Geological Survey, between 2017 and 2020 the United States imported a whopping 78% of its rare earth metals from China, followed by Estonia (6%), Malaysia (5%) and Japan (4%). In addition, China-made inexpensive printed circuit boards also used to find their way into US equipment.According to Pauken, Beijing does not even need to ""shoot back"" when it comes to Washington's TikTok ban, because the US' decoupling from China is likely to backfire.""China just has to prepare for this decoupling and then they'll just have to localize their technologies, which they've been doing already, because they had anticipated these actions from a long time ago,"" the Beijing-based commentator said. ""If the US goes ahead, pushes forward with all these bans, business-wise, they're hurting themselves. China doesn't have to retaliate because they're punishing themselves for it.""The US move to impose restrictions on China and Russia's social media platforms will only add to the already growing distrust between the nations, according to Pauken.

https://www.pressherald.com/2022/12/15/extreme-delays-plague-mail-delivery-during-busiest-week-of-year-union-says/,"‘Extreme’ delays plague mail delivery during busiest week of year, union says","U.S. Postal Service customers in Greater Portland are experiencing major delivery delays because of worker shortages and the prioritizing of packages over first-class mail, according to the union representing letter carriers.

The postal service denies that any packages are prioritized over first-class mail, and said some delivery inconsistencies are unavoidable as resources are strained.

However, a union leader and a local letter carrier say some customers are now going five or six days without regular mail delivery – at the busiest time of the year for the postal service, which has previously grappled with disruptions resulting from high package volume and a dwindling workforce.

“There are extreme delays every day,” said Mark Seitz, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers Branch 92, which represents about 700 workers in southern Maine.

Seitz said mail for 15 to 20 routes in the area doesn’t go out for delivery every day, primarily because management is illegally delaying first-class mail in favor of fourth-class packages – most often from Amazon – in order to collect bonuses. The problem seems to be widespread but is particularly noticeable in Portland, Westbrook, South Portland, Cape Elizabeth, Falmouth, Cumberland Foreside, Biddeford, Saco and Old Orchard Beach, he said.

Stephen Doherty, a spokesperson for the USPS Northeast Region, denied the postal service prioritizes Amazon packages over delivering other mail.

“We deliver mail for thousands of companies just across New England,” he said in an email. “No one (company’s) mail is given priority over others.”

Earlier this month, mail was not delivered to Mabel O’Brien’s Falmouth home on a Friday, Saturday and Monday, she said. But on that Sunday, an Amazon package addressed to someone else was dropped off at her house. While she understands the postal service is shorthanded, she wishes she could depend on it to be more reliable.

“It doesn’t seem right to keep raising the stamp rate and you don’t get what you pay for,” O’Brien said.

Doherty said the postal service is hiring new employees, investing in new technology and delivering a volume of packages that has grown exponentially in recent years. Some customers may see their mail delivered later in the day or by a different carrier during the holiday season, he noted.

STRETCHED BEYOND CAPACITY

“The current hiring strain, combined with holiday volumes, can cause us to stretch our capacity beyond its limit and result in pockets of delays in our delivery network,” Doherty said. “When this happens, we use all of the tools at our disposal, including overtime, delivering earlier in the day, later in the evening and on weekends and, in emergency situations, utilizing management personnel to deliver the mail.”

The postal service recently converted more than 100,000 employees to full-time career status and is aggressively hiring, Doherty said. “The current low unemployment rate in Maine makes this a challenge as there are many companies hiring and fewer available job seekers.”

Despite efforts to hire more letter carriers, the staffing issue continues to worsen, Seitz said. Some carriers are working 16-hour days, seven days a week. Carriers are frustrated, as are customers who aren’t getting their mail consistently, he said.

“They want the mail to get delivered, but they’re hamstrung by management’s inability to hire and manage mail properly,” Seitz said.

Steven Fulmer, a city letter carrier in South Portland for the past five years, is concerned about carriers being forced to work overtime and deliver long after dark, especially following the murder of a postal worker in Milwaukee last week.

Fulmer’s bigger concern, however, is about mail handling at the Scarborough distribution center. Last year, he told the postal service that the weekly South Portland-Cape Elizabeth Sentry newspaper was being discarded along vacant routes instead of being delivered. He said he recently discovered and reported that the same thing is happening again.

The Sentry is part of the Masthead Maine publication network that includes the Press Herald.

Fulmer has since been placed on leave. Fulmer said supervisors told him that he made a statement that made people uncomfortable and is considered a threat, but both he and Seitz say the leave is retaliation for whistleblowing.

Doherty said he is not aware of any accusations of mail being discarded, which is a criminal offense. Those types of accusations are investigated by the Office of the Inspector General, he said.

PUSHING FOR ANSWERS

Seitz said he has contacted the offices of Sen. Angus King and Rep. Chellie Pingree about the persistent delays. Pingree’s office also has been receiving complaints about mail delays. She has called for the firing of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy.

“Mail delays throughout my district are ongoing and completely unacceptable. My constituents should not have to worry if their Social Security check, medicine, or grandchild’s holiday card will make it to their mailboxes,” Pingree, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Sen. Susan Collins has been pushing for answers from the postal service about widespread delays and staffing levels since early this year. In an October letter to DeJoy, the Republican said persistent problems must be addressed, reiterating the importance of the postal service in a rural state like Maine.

“The problems are frequently blamed on ‘staffing shortages,’ but there has been no guidance as to what USPS is doing to address the matter – which has been a problem for an extended period of time,” Collins wrote. “The bottom line is that basic services are not being met.”

In a response to Collins on Nov. 3, USPS liaison Scott Slusher said the service was unable to forecast a date by which staffing levels would be at the level needed to meet obligations throughout Maine.

“There are insufficient applicants relative to the vacancies, and our overall staffing levels have dropped each month since December 2021. Nevertheless, we are continuing to participate in recruitment events and promoting employment opportunities on various platforms,” Slusher wrote.

https://www.insideedition.com/the-rhoden-family-massacre-everything-we-know-about-case-of-8-relatives-murdered-allegedly-by-77803,Everything We Know About the Rhoden Family Massacre,"In an Ohio courtroom, a diabolical tale of murder and mayhem has unfolded as a mother described how her family allegedly plotted and carried out the massacre of another.

Angela Walker has taken the witness stand for three days now, describing in detail how she, her sons and her husband schemed to kill eight members of the Rhoden family six years ago in a tiny rural enclave in the state's Appalachian region.

The alleged reason? A custody battle over a shared granddaughter and accusations the toddler was being sexually abused, according to prosecutors.

The case is the most expensive and complicated murder investigation in Ohio's history, authorities said. State lawmakers set aside at least $1 million for the trial, a cost they said would bankrupt tiny Pike County, where nearly 20% of residents live in poverty, according to U.S. Census figures.

In exchange for Walker's testimony, prosecutors dropped eight counts of aggravated murder against her and agreed not to seek the death penalty. Wagner pleaded guilty in September 2021 to 14 other counts and said she would testify against her older son, George Wagner IV, and later against her husband, George “Billy” Wagner III. She will serve 30 years as part of the plea deal, prosecutors said.

George Wagner IV, 31, is currently on trial for eight counts of murder and a slew of other charges alleging he was part of his family’s criminal enterprise in the plotting, execution and covering up the shooting deaths of Christopher “Chris” Rhoden Sr., 40; Chris Rhoden’s former wife, Dana Manley Rhoden, 37; their children, Clarence “Frankie” Rhoden, 20, Hanna May Rhoden, 19, and Christopher “Chris” Rhoden Jr., 16; Frankie’s fiancée, Hannah Hazel Gilley, 20; Christopher Sr.’s brother Kenneth Rhoden, 44; and their cousin Gary Rhoden, 38.

The Wagners had initially denied having anything to do with the killings. The four relatives were arrested in 2018 and a gag ordered was issued in the case. Few details were made public until last year, when the youngest of the defendants started talking.

Edward “Jake” Wagner, 29 — who is the father of the child at the center of the custody dispute — accepted a plea deal in April 2021. In exchange for not facing a possible death sentence, he agreed to testify against his family members. He told a judge he had killed five of the eight victims, including the mother of his child. He will be sentenced to eight consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole, prosecutors said.

Last month, Jake Wagner testified against his brother, telling jurors the plot to kill the Rhodens was his father's idea and that he went along with it to regain custody of his daughter.

George Wagner III and George Wagner IV, father and son, have pleaded not guilty and their trials are not expected to begin until next year, authorities said. Both are charged with eight counts of aggravated murder, aggravated burglary and conspiracy to commit aggravated murder. They have denied shooting anyone, according to defense attorneys.

The ""execution-style murders"" occurred overnight in April 2016 at four separate homes in Pike County, authorities said. Some victims were shot in the head as they slept, others were killed in ""sniper"" attacks from a truck, investigators said.

The child at the center of the custody dispute belonged to Jake Wagner and Hanna May Rhoden. The two had met when she was 13 and Jake was 18. Hanna became pregnant with his child when she was 15. That child, a girl, is now 8 and is said to be in custody of maternal relatives.

The couple split in 2015, after Hanna alleged she had been physically abused by Jake, her relatives told investigators. The two were locked in a battle over custody of the child when the murders occurred, authorities said, with Jake claiming their daughter was being sexually abused while in her mother's care.

During the massacre, there were two children in one of the homes. In another was days-old Kylie, who was nursing at the breast of her mother, Hanna May Rhoden. The children were spared. Jake Wagner calmly testified last month that he shot his ex-girlfriend twice in the head that night.

Prosecutors said Jake had told investigators he had rearranged Hannah's bloody body so the newborn could continue to nurse.

This week on the witness stand, Jake's mother described how she helped plot the killings with her family claiming it was to protect her then-2-year-old granddaughter from being molested.

“Nobody’s heart was in it,” she said on the stand. “Nobody wanted to do it.”

Angela Wagner did not participate in the shootings, but acknowledged on the stand that she had helped plan them and purchased items including shoes that would be used in the killings.

She told jurors she regretted involving her sons in the murder plan.",Q4

Sixty-year-old Fred Holmes of Thorney Road, Eye was spotted in a field in Warmington near Oundle with three dogs which went on to chase and kill a hare on the afternoon of October 23 last year.

He was challenged by a witness, who told him what he was doing was illegal and asked him to leave.

Holmes assumed the person was the owner of the field and asked to buy them a drink so they could come to an arrangement for the use of the land.

Instead, the witness reported Holmes to Northamptonshire Police, and the force's Rural Crime Team began to investigate.

They soon linked in with colleagues in Lincolnshire, where on November 13 last year, Holmes was arrested by officers in connection with further hare-coursing-related offences in Low Road, Crowland.

Fred Holmes

He was already subject to a community protection notice there after committing similar offences previously, and his three lurcher-type dogs were seized alongside his mobile phone.

Investigations by both forces resulted in Holmes being charged with two counts of trespass in pursuit of game, and two counts of being equipped to trespass in pursuit of hares.

Despite initially denying the Northamptonshire offences, at Boston Magistrates’ Court on Friday (November 10), he entered guilty pleas to all four counts.

A deprivation order was made against Holmes, which saw him forfeit the three dogs, which will now be rehomed, the Citroen car he used during the offences and a thermal imager device found in his vehicle thought to have been used by him to locate hares.

COURT RESULT

3 of the team have been in court today where Fred Holmes of Peterborough pleaded guilty to 2 offences of trespass in pursuit of hares and 2 offences of being equipped to hare course

Holmes was ordered to pay £16,783.50 for the kennel costs of keeping the three dogs since their seizure, as well as fines for the two trespass offences and two victim surcharges, making a total of £18,557.50.

He was also banned from keeping dogs for 10 years.

PC Chloe Gillies, of the Rural Crime Team at Northamptonshire Police, said: “The actions of Fred Holmes in allowing his dogs to chase and kill hares were cruel and illegal.

“He deliberately trespassed onto private land to break the law, causing fear and concern to the landowners, and then lied repeatedly to the police about what he was doing.

“This case sends out a clear message that hare courses are not welcome in our county, and demonstrates the close working relationships we have with our surrounding forces to both prevent and bring people to justice for these types of offences.”

Sgt Debbie Nunn of Lincolnshire Police added: “This is a fantastic result and credit goes to all of those involved.

“We’d like to say thank you to the members of the community for reporting this incident to us, your assistance is vital to our investigations.

“We hope this sends a strong message that we will take robust action to prevent and disrupt those involved in rural crime, which is often linked to other forms of criminality.”",Q4
https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2022/11/21/693116/Iran-says-IAEA-resolution-politically-motivated,"IAEA anti-Iran resolution politically-motivated, meant to damage Tehran-agency ties: FM spokesman","Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman says the UN nuclear agency adopted the “politically-motivated” anti-Tehran resolution as the country has “the most transparent” peaceful nuclear program.

Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Nasser Kan’ani said “the politically-motivated resolution was issued while Iran has the most transparent peaceful nuclear program” in terms of the number of facilities under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) compared to other countries and the number of inspections its nuclear activities have undergone by the IAEA.

He stressed that the resolution was enforced after the US and the three European countries exerted pressure on the agency’s Board of Governors.

The spokesman did not give more details on Iran’s response to the resolution, saying the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran would declare the details when necessary.

Earlier, Kan’ani had said Iran took the first step in responding to the resolution.

“In response to the latest action of the three European countries and the United States, namely the passing of a resolution against Iran in the agency’s Board of Governors, a number of measures were put on the agenda of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and their implementation was carried out in the enrichment complexes of Martyr Ahmadi in Natanz and Martyr Alimohammadi complex in Fordow in the presence of the IAEA’s inspectors,” he said.

That came as Director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Mohammad Eslami said earlier in the day that the Islamic Republic will give a “firm response” to the anti-Iran resolution.

Noting that the resolution aims to mount pressure on Iran, Kan’ani said on Sunday that Tehran won’t bow to pressure and that Iran will continue its peaceful nuclear program in accordance with its needs and in compliance with its international obligations.

Also on Sunday, he slammed the “instrumental use” of the international organizations against independent nations, saying that “has become a norm” of the foreign policy of Western countries.

The draft resolution, ratified on Thursday, has criticized Iran for what it called a lack of cooperation with the agency. It was put forward by the United States, Britain, France and Germany, in continuation of their political pressures on Iran. Russia and China voted against the motion.

Germany’s dark history of rights violation

Elsewhere in his remarks, Kan'ani condemned a resolution approved by the United Nations General Assembly’s Third Committee on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic, stressing that ""the politicizing of the human rights issue is not constructive at all"".

He further said the resolution that was proposed by certain Western countries, including Germany, is politically-motivated.

Noting that German has a dark history of violating human rights, the spokesman said, ""The German government is not in a position to take such actions against independent countries, including Iran.""

The General Assembly’s Third Committee on Wednesday approved the draft resolution titled “Situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran” by a vote of 80 in favor to 28 against, with 68 abstentions.

The draft resolution was proposed over claims of a violent “crackdown” on protests in Iran. Since mid-September, Iran has been rocked by riots after the death of Mahsa Amini.

The 22-year-old fainted at a police station in Tehran and was pronounced dead three days later in hospital.

An official report by Iran’s Legal Medicine Organization concluded that Amini’s death was caused by illness rather than alleged blows to the head or other vital body organs.

Rioters went on rampage in the country, brutally attacking security officers and causing massive damage to public property as Western powers, especially the United States, provided support.",Q4

His political party said he was shot in the leg, and he was stable while he was taken to hospital.

Khan was leading a protest march, demanding elections to unseat the new government.

Khan's political party, PTI, said Khan ""was shot in the leg but was stable while being taken to hospital."" It described the attack as an ""assassination attempt.""

Shehbaz Sharif, the country's current prime minister confirmed that he was shot, and said other people were also injured.

Sharif condemned the shooting and said it would be investigated.

He said other people were also injured, and wrote ""Violence should have no place in our country's politics.""

PTI shared a video that it said shows Khan, who is 70, waving to supporters after he was shot. It shows him standing and waving while an armed guard stands in front of him.

Watch the video here:

Asad Umar, an aide for Khan, told Reuters that Khan and several other people were injured in the shooting. He said Khan was injured in his shin.

""A man opened fire with an automatic weapon. Several people are wounded. Imran Khan is also injured,"" he said. There was no further information on who the man was.

Sky News reported that Khan was shot in the leg while speaking to supporters. One of its reporters was in the crowd and witnessed the attack.

Local media reported that he was shot in the foot, and that he was ""out of danger,"" Reuters reported. Those reports said he was wounded when his convoy was shot at, according to Reuters.

Khan was in Wazirabad, leading a protest march to Islamabad as part of efforts to call new elections in the country, according to Sky News.

This video, shared by Khan on Tuesday, showed the scale of an earlier rally:

Khan, who is now the chairman of the country's PTI political party, had been prime minister a little less than four years when he was ousted in April after losing a parliamentary no-confidence vote.

He tried to block the vote, but was overruled by the country's Supreme Court and removed from office.

Khan claimed, without evidence, that he was the victim of an international US-led conspiracy to remove him, and called on his supporters to take to the streets in marches like the one on Thursday, demanding new elections.

The US has said that there is no truth to the allegations. It was widely believed that Khan had lost the support of the military, a major power-broker behind the scenes of Pakistani politics.

Earlier this month Pakistan's election commission barred Khan from holding office for five years over allegations that he failed to declare and sold some gifts given to him while in office. Khan denied all of the charges.

https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/idaho-university-murders-911-call-logs-reveal-chilling-warning,Idaho university murders: 911 call logs reveal chilling warning in wake of killings,"

Call logs in Moscow, Idaho, show a fearful community reporting several instances of suspicious men as the person who killed the four University of Idaho students remains at large.

University students Ethan Chapin, 20, Xana Kernodle, 20, Madison Mogen, 21, and Kaylee Goncalves, 21, were murdered in their beds early on Nov. 13, and each was stabbed in both the chest and upper body with a large knife. Police found their bodies after a 911 call was placed from one of the women’s roommates.

IDAHO STUDENT MURDERS: EX-FBI INVESTIGATOR REVEALS CHILLING THEORY AS STUDENTS RETURN TO CLASSES

Since Nov. 13, Moscow police have received 78 calls for unusual circumstances and 36 requests to check the welfare of loved ones, an increase from 70 and 18, respectively, for the month of October, per a police press release sent Sunday.

With no suspect arrested or identified, police have had to address and clarify several rumors circulating on social media, as well as specify any people ruled out as suspects — the roommates, “other friends” at the house when the 911 call was placed, a third-party driver, and a man captured on video standing near the victims.

However, Moscow residents are still on high alert, and 911 call logs show that many have called in to report suspicious people or activity, according to an analysis of the logs conducted by the Independent.

In one call, a caller claimed that a man had given his or her daughter a note on the back of a receipt at her workplace that said, “You better watch out.” Another call placed by the owner of a laundromat said he found a “mark on [a] column inside that looks like blood.”

Several callers have reported suspicious vehicles or people, with one saying there was a person “standing in the cul-de-sac, wearing a big jacket and wearing a black ski mask” and another claiming there was someone ripping down tip line posters for the Nov. 13 murders.

Police followed up with some of the calls and made contact with some of the suspicious persons, but no reports or arrests have been made, per the Independent.

Chief James Fry and several other investigators have said in press conferences and interviews that police are providing limited information to the public on the nature of the attack, including whether one or all of the victims were targets, as well as a profile of the suspect, to prevent any damage to their investigation.

“It will potentially put more fear, more suspicion on a wide variety of people versus if we use that to really refine where we’re at in our investigation. I think that will be more pertinent,” Aaron Snell, Idaho State Police communications director, told Fox News on Sunday. “And so if we just provide information to the public, I just don’t think that that’s going to be a wise choice.”

Anthony Joseph Drury, 31, was charged with third-degree murder and fourth-degree drug sale last December.

Drury originally pleaded not guilty to both charges, but changed his plea for the murder charge to guilty on Wednesday, Dec. 28. The court accepted his plea.

An ambulance was dispatched at 10:31 p.m. on Dec. 2, 2021, to 314 Water Avenue North in St. Hilaire, according to an affidavit in the case.

Pennington County Sheriff's Deputy David Olson was in the area and arrived on scene within minutes. Olson was met by Drury and his mother. Drury brought Olson to his bedroom in the basement, where Olson saw 20-year-old Michaela Rose Constance Cooper.

Cooper was lying on the bed, her face blue. According to Drury, he and Cooper relapsed that day after more than a week of no drug use.

Olson checked Cooper for a pulse but couldn't find one. Multiple emergency personnel, including Olson, assisted with CPR. Two doses of Narcan were administered but had no effect.

At 11:08 p.m., Sanford paramedics pronounced Cooper dead on the scene.

Drury told law enforcement he bought the drugs — fentanyl pills — from James Michael Morin, 24. Morin was eventually convicted of third-degree murder. His two other charges for a fourth-degree controlled substance crime and fifth-degree drug possession were dismissed.

On Aug. 23, Morin was sentenced to 110 months — a little more than nine years — in prison.

Third-degree murder (distributing a schedule 1 or 2 controlled substance) has a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison and a $40,000 fine. Fourth-degree sale of a schedule 1, 2 or 3 drug (not marijuana) has a maximum penalty of 15 years and a $100,000 fine.

Speaking with Robbie Fox on My Mom’s Basement, AEW President Tony Khan confirmed that AEW Dynamite: Winter is Coming will return later this year. While there is no set date just yet, the past two editions of Winter is Coming have taken place in December. When it airs, barring any other televised specials, Winter is Coming will be the 12th special edition of AEW Dynamite of 2022.

Videos by ComicBook.com

In the event’s short history, Winter is Coming has been home to numerous industry-altering events. The 2020 edition that aired from Daily’s Place was home to the AEW debut of Sting, as the wrestling legend came to the aid of Darby Allin and Cody Rhodes. This began Sting’s alliance with Allin, which he has maintained ever since. The 2020 show was main-evented by Kenny Omega dethroning Jon Moxley for the AEW World Title. That match culminated in then-Impact Wrestling Executive Vice President Don Callis helping Omega capture the title, sparking a cross-promotional storyline that essentially birthed the “forbidden door” concept.

2021’s Winter is Coming hailed from Garland, Texas and opened with then-AEW World Champion “Hangman” Adam Page wrestling Bryan Danielson to a 60-minute time limit draw. As of this writing, Page and Danielson’s first clash is the longest match in AEW television history. Beyond that world title contest, MJF defeated Dante Martin in the main event to win the AEW Dynamite Diamond Ring for a third time.

There’s no indication on what matches will take place at this year’s Winter is Coming, but precedent hints that the AEW World Title will be defended on the show. There could be something to do with the AEW Dynamite Diamond Ring as well. 2020’s Winter is Coming featured the Dynamite Diamond Ring battle royal, while the 2021 edition was main-evented by the aforementioned finals. Location for this year’s event is also unconfirmed, but Khan heavily hinted that Texas will once again be home to Winter is Coming.

“I gotta tell you, I really love this tradition we built around the holidays,” Khan said in an earlier interview. “I love coming out in December to Dallas every year. I got a good feeling about coming back and bringing Winter is Coming back to Dallas again this year. I love the Dallas market and I think there’s a good chance we’re gonna come back again and do Winter is Coming again this year.”

Here’s how West Virginia Amendment 2 could start a complex battle over tax policy

Mountain State Spotlight ^ | November 4, 2022 | P.R. Lockhart

Posted on by SovereignVA

The amendment itself doesn’t actually change or repeal property taxes; rather, it will change the state constitution to allow the state Legislature to act how it sees fit. Lawmakers pushing for the change argue that as a body of officials elected by West Virginians, they should have the power to control and alter these taxes, but even so the effort has been criticized as part of a larger attempt at a legislative “power grab” this election season.

But if voters approve the amendment, there’s more than one way that the state Legislature could respond to getting the power that it wants.

So far, the most information has come from a draft Senate plan. It lays out an elimination of the current annual tax on personal vehicles as well as cutting inventory taxes businesses pay on unsold goods and taxes on heavy machinery and equipment. Legislators and some tax policy groups say that these taxes make it difficult to attract businesses to West Virginia, and that ending them will help make the state more competitive.

""I always wondered why WV was such a poor state. Beautiful, but dirt poor."" WV is in a catch 22 situation on economic development. Inadequate basic services and infrastructure makes business look elsewhere which leads to continued inadequacy in services and infrastructure because the tax base does not grow. Throw in parochialism you have a formula for no economic growth.

DELPHI, Ind — A judge is considering whether whether to publicly release court documents on the murders of two Delphi teenagers. The judge said she will release an order at a future time during a hearing Tuesday, Nov. 22.

On Tuesday, Nov. 29, Allen filed a motion for a change of venue for his trial, according to court documents.

During a Tuesday morning court hearing, special judge Fran Gull said she would take arguments made by the Carroll County prosecutor and defense attorneys for defendant Richard Allen under advisement. She plans to release a decision soon.

Allen is charged with two counts of murder in connection with the 2017 killings of Abby Williams and Libby German in Delphi.

During the 30-minute hearing, prosecutor Nicholas McLeland told the judge he and investigators have reason to believe Allen is not the only one involved in the murders.

“This is still a very ongoing investigation,” McLeland said. “We believe Richard Allen is not the only actor involved in this.”

Biggest news that came out of this morning’s hearing about sealed records in the #Delphi murder case is this statement by the prosecutor. “We believe Richard Allen is not the only actor involved in this.” #wthr — Bob Segall (@BobSegallWTHR) November 22, 2022

McLeland said, for that reason, the probable cause affidavit – a document that explains why a defendant has been arrested for a specific crime – should not be made public despite Allen’s arrest and charges.

The prosecutor presented the judge with a statement from the lead Indiana State Police investigator assigned to the murder case as well as a letter from Libby German’s grandmother supporting his motion to keep the probable cause affidavit sealed.

He also argued releasing the document would interfere with the investigation, endanger the safety and privacy of witnesses and lead to chaos for the legal proceedings.

The prosecutor asked the judge to keep them sealed or, if they are released, to at least keep the names of witnesses private.

On Wednesday, the Carroll County Prosecutor's Office released a statement saying, ""we strongly believe the evidence shows Richard Allen was involved in the murder of Libby and Abby. Because the investigation is ongoing and given the intense public interest in this case, we think it would be best if the documents remain sealed. Regardless of the ruling, we believe we have a very strong case against Mr. Allen and look forward to making our argument in trial.""

HAPPENING NOW:



For the first time since Tuesday's hearing in the #RichardAllen case, we are hearing from Carroll County Prosecutor Nicholas McLeland.



Here is his statement, shared by Indiana State Police.@WTHRcom | #Delphi pic.twitter.com/uc4OiV8NhP — Samantha Johnson 13 NEWS (@SamJohnsonNews) November 23, 2022

Richard Allen's attorneys told the judge the prosecutor’s statements were “conjecture and speculation” and that failing to release the probable cause affidavit could lead to the very chaos that McLeland predicted.

“Any secrecy involved in the case has simply heightened public interest,” defense attorney Brad Rozzi said. “By continuing that pattern … we are just perpetuating the problem.”

Gull will weigh the evidence and exhibits before issuing an order on the motion to keep the court documents secret.

Under Indiana Rule 6 for Access to Public Court Records, the prosecutor is responsible for demonstrating with clear and convincing evidence that the records must be kept sealed to either substantially serve the public interest, prevent a significant risk of substantial harm to the requestor or other persons, or to prevent a substantial prejudicial effect to ongoing proceedings that cannot be avoided without prohibiting public access.

After the hearing, attorney Andrew Baldwin, another defense attorney working on Allen’s defense team, said “our client is the wrong guy.” Standing outside the courtroom, he said the sealed probable cause affidavit is “flimsy” and that ""you expect more than what I saw.”

Baldwin said Allen professed his innocence to him and did it emotionally.

As part of Allen's petition to be let out on bail, he claims that ""because neither the proof of guilt is evident, nor the presumption of guilt strong, the Accused is seeking a hearing to release the Accused."" Allen is asking for the court to either reduce his bail to a ""reasonable"" amount or release him on his own recognizance. The hearing for that decision is now scheduled for Feb. 17, 2023.

Allen was under tight security as he was ushered into the Carroll County Courthouse Tuesday morning with his wrists and ankles bound in chains.

A short while earlier, the family of Libby German arrived and entered the courthouse to await a chance to see the man accused of killing Libby.

Tuesday, the prosecutor filed a new motion that would prohibit all attorneys, law enforcement and family members involved in the case from speaking or providing information about the case outside of court.

""Yesterday was a long hard day and I am glad it is finally over,"" Becky Patty, grandmother of Libby German, wrote in a Facebook post Wednesday morning.

""The one question many were asking the families is “how do you feel?” Actually, that is a tough question to answer,"" Patty wrote in the post. ""When we were called in and told LE had someone in custody, I thought I would be elated – but then you stop and think about all the new lives that will be affected by this person being arrested and realize it really is sad.""

""So, when [Richard Allen] walked into the courtroom and I saw him for the first time – all these emotions and thoughts were running through my mind at the same time and I didn’t know how to feel. I guess my answer to that question is confused. I am just confused…..,"" Patty wrote at the end of her post.

Detectives with the Delphi Double Homicide Task Force took 50-year-old Richard Matthew Allen of Delphi into custody on Oct. 26, 2022 at the Indiana State Police Post in West Lafayette.

He was taken to the Carroll County Jail and held there until Friday, Oct. 28, when he was transferred to the White County Jail.

Allen was formally charged with two counts of murder on Oct. 28 for the killings of Libby German and Abby Williams in February 2017. The probable cause affidavit, a document which is almost always considered a public document, was sealed at the prosecutor’s request even before criminal charges were filed and has remained secret since.

Allen had not been previously mentioned as a suspect possibly connected to the girls' deaths.

He has lived in Delphi for at least 16 years and his home is less than two miles from the Monon High Bridge where the two murdered teens were last seen. Records show the suspect previously lived in Greenwood and in Mexico, Indiana.

13News learned Allen is a licensed pharmacy technician. He received his Indiana license in 2018 and it's still active. Neighbors told 13News Allen worked at the CVS in Delphi, even at one point developing photos for Libby German's family after the killings. Her family said Allen would not charge them for the photos.

Allen has no criminal history other than a few speeding tickets and a citation for not wearing a seat belt.",Q4

Chinese General Secretary Xi Jinping’s “Zero COVID” policy has ignited protests across the country, with authorities locking down thousands of neighborhoods and sending citizens into quarantine centers, NPR reported. Stocks fell Monday after protests against China’s strict COVID-19 restrictions shook investor sentiment. (RELATED: China COVID-19 Lockdowns And Protests Might Slow iPhone Production By Millions Of Units)

There are “worries that these COVID protests in China could actually derail the entire global economy. In this case, though, I say, ‘You know what? Let it happen,'” Payne said on “Making Money with Charles Payne.”

The protests spread after a fire at an apartment complex in Urumqi, a city in the western province of Xinjiang. The fire reportedly killed at least 10 people after quarantine barriers and locked doors prevented tenants from escaping.

The Biden administration said that the U.S. won’t be implementing a zero-COVID policy like China, but will instead increase vaccinations, including boosters, and make testing and treatment more easily accessible instead.

“We’ve long said everyone has the right to peacefully protest, here in the United States and around the world,” the spokesperson added. “This includes the PRC.”

“I’ve replayed that night a million times over trying to think if there was some sign or some detail that something was amiss, but there was nothing,” the taxi driver, who asked for anonymity, told UK tabloid The Daily Mail.

“It’s not lost on me that my job was to get these girls home safe but that didn’t really help this time.”

Moscow Police have said that the “private party” who drove Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves home that night is not a suspect in their brutal murders alongside roommate Xana Kernodle and her boyfriend Ethan Chapin. The four were found stabbed to death later that morning, after the other two roommates in house woke up, found them, and called their friends over, as CrimeOnline previously reported.

The cabbie said he picked up Goncalves and Mogen between 1:40 and 1:45 that morning from outside the Grub Truck, where they had just been seen on surveillance video buying pasta dinners, and drove them straight to the house, no more than a five minute drive.

“They had their food, and they were super excited about their mac and cheese as girls are after they go to the club,” he recalled.

“They were normal just like any other night. They weren’t upset about anything or talking about anyone,” the taxi driver said. “There was no nervousness about them. They weren’t afraid of anybody. There was nobody following them or following us.”

Kernodle and Chapin, who had been at a fraternity party, arrived home at near the same time. Police say the four were murdered between 3 and 4 a.m.

The driver said that he contacted police as soon as he realized who the victims were in the stabbings that shocked the University of Idaho community, handing over his digital data and the receipt from Taco Bell, where he headed after he dropped the two women off at their rental home. He said he didn’t wait to see them get inside.

Local police, who are being assisted by Idaho State Police and the FBI, have come under fire from family members and locals who believe they’re not doing enough to solve the case. The cab driver is one of those.

“Those kids deserve justice, and they’re not getting it,” he said.

Investigators are pointedly looking for a white Hyundai Elantra that was seen on security video speeding away from the area where the slayings took place early that morning. A white Elantra found crashed in Eugene, Oregon, turned out not to be connected. Police said they spoke with the owner, a woman from Colorado, and asked the public to “stop contacting” her.

The United States and South Korea began one of their largest combined military air drills on Monday, which will involve hundreds of warplanes from both sides staging mock attacks 24 hours a day for the better part of a week.

In denouncing the drills in a statement carried by North Korea's official news agency, Pak Jong Chon, secretary of the Central Committee of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, warned the United States and South Korea against any attempt to attack.

""If the U.S. and South Korea attempt to use armed forces against the DPRK without any fear, the special means of the DPRK's armed forces will carry out their strategic mission without delay and the U.S. and South Korea will have to face a terrible case and pay the most horrible price in history,"" the statement said, using the initials of North Korea's official name.

It demanded that Washington and Seoul ""stop their frantic 'military games' and provocative remarks.""

""In the present situation, it is a big mistake to accept this as a threat warning only, the statement said. ""Such military rashness and provocation can be no longer tolerated.""

North Korea's foreign ministry on Monday demanded an end to the drills, saying they could draw ""more powerful follow-up measures"" from Pyongyang.

North Korea and South Korea remain technically at war since an armistice agreement ended fighting in the 1950-1953 Korean War.

Washington and Seoul believe North Korea may be about to resume testing of nuclear bombs for the first time since 2017 and have embraced a strategy of ""deterring"" Pyongyang through major military drills that some current and former officials say may worsen tensions.

White House security spokesman John Kirby was asked at a regular briefing on Tuesday whether there was concern that North Korea might conduct a nuclear test when the G20 meets in Bali in the middle of the month.

""In general, our concern remains high,"" Mr. Kirby said.

U.S. President Joe Biden, whose fellow Democrats face tough midterm elections on Nov. 8, is due to travel to Cambodia from Nov. 12-13 to participate in a U.S.-ASEAN summit and the East Asia Summit and then to Indonesia from Nov. 13-16 for the G20.",Q4
https://abcnews.go.com/US/uvalde-community-split-gun-control-months-robb-elementary/story?id=92539704,Uvalde community split on gun control months after Robb Elementary shooting,"Families of slain students press for more changes.

Nearly six months after a gunman armed with an AR-15 killed 19 students and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, the community remains divided on the topic of gun control.

Many of Uvalde's families have grown up hunting, so guns have been built into the county's culture and economic lifeblood for generations.

But the May 24 school shooting has left some longtime residents and gun owners rethinking their views. Jesse Rizo, a Uvalde rancher who lost his 9-year-old niece Jackie Cazares in the shooting, told ABC News that the shooting showed residents that they need to take a head-on approach to address the problem.

Uvalde, Texas residents rally for increased gun control following the Robb Elementary school shooting. ABC News

""It's something that was dormant. It's something that nobody wanted to touch. But now it's inevitable,"" he told ABC News.

Some residents, however, contend the shooting may prompt gun control actions that they say go too far.

""I really, I really don't feel like banning any gun is going to solve any problem,"" Jason Molitor, who owns Ox Ranch, an exotic-game hunting property outside of Uvalde, told ABC News.

Uvalde:365 is a continuing ABC News series reported from Uvalde and focused on the Texas community and how it forges on in the shadow of tragedy.

Rizo and other gun control advocates contend that the solutions they're pushing for won't be a burden for those businesses and will save lives.

Jason Molitor, who owns an ox farm for hunting outside of Uvalde, told ABC News he opposes proposals to ban assault rifles. ABC News

Rizo, who has been vocal in town meetings and rallies over the past six months, said that the difference in opinions on gun control is part of the pain that the Uvalde community is facing since the massacre.

""I don't know one person here who didn't grow up without a weapon at a young age. All of us. All my friends,"" he said.

Molitor said he held his first firearm when he was 5 and shot his first deer three years later. The rancher said he uses his AR-15s to hunt hogs, contending that the assault rifle is the best way to shoot the passel.

""We consider the pigs as an invasive species, a nuisance, and they multiply,"" he said. ""You want the larger capacity magazines so we can try to get more of them.""

Molitor, who noted that one of his ranch employees lost his son in the Robb Elementary shooting, said he supported some gun control policies such as raising the age to purchase a firearm and more background checks, but he opposed proposals to ban assault rifles.

He said such a move could affect his business and other hunting ranches in the area, which he estimated drives $10 million to $12 million into the Uvalde economy.

""We'd like to see something done to stop [mass shootings] from happening, but as far as starting to take guns and guns rights away from people? That's just a slippery slope that I think really concerns a lot of gun owners,"" Molitor said.

Gun control activists and some of the families impacted by the shooting have called for policies such as banning assault rifles like the one used in the shooting, increasing the legal age for purchasing a firearm and stricter background checks.

Rizo said arguments about taking a person's gun away are scare tactics spread by the opponents of control policies.

He added that the shooting and the death of his niece made him and his family see the issue in a different spectrum, and he urged other residents to hear the families out.

""The main focus should be on the children and on the teachers that lost their lives that day. If you can keep that as your compass and as your guiding light, then that's what's important,"" Rizo said.

Rizo acknowledged that it will take a lot of time and a lot of work before residents can find that common ground on gun control, but he said, ""with patience, people begin to understand each other.""

In the meantime, Rizo said he is considering donating his hunting ranch and turning it into a memorial for the Robb Elementary victims.

The Communist Party under Xi Jinping has been confronting China’s widest and boldest surge of protest in decades, as large numbers gathered over the weekend to denounce Mr. Xi’s stringent, exhausting and increasingly difficult efforts to eliminate Covid cases.

Although security forces reasserted control over neighborhoods and university campuses this week, the tumult on Monday and Tuesday nights on the edge of Guangzhou suggested that poor, frustrated communities of migrant workers may keep pushing back against the “zero Covid” measures, especially the weekslong shutdowns of neighborhoods.

Update 3:03 p.m. Special Prosecutor Angela Canepa wrapped up her closing statement in the trial of George Wagner IV by emphasizing the testimony against him from his mother and brother, who said Wagner IV participated in the killings of eight people in Pike County in 2016.

""The family has spoken,"" Canepa said, echoing Wagner IV when he told brother Jake Wagner he needed to end his marriage, per audio evidence. ""Jake and (mother) Angela have told you everything this defendant did that night.""

The jury will reconvene at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday to hear the closing statement from Wagner IV's attorneys.

Update 1:20 p.m. Special Prosecutor Angela Canepa put circumstantial and direct evidence in front of jurors in quick succession Monday morning to try to convince them to convict George Wagner IV on aggravated murder and other charges in connection with the 2016 Pike County killings.

In the category of circumstantial evidence, Canepa said the Wagners aimed to control all the women and children in their lives, including monitoring the social media of their wives and girlfriends. Additionally, they bought parts for homemade gun silencers, got tattoos with ties to the homicides and watched a clip from ""Boondock Saints"" four hours before the first victims were shot to death the night of April 21, 2016.

For direct evidence, Canepa highlighted testimony from Angela and Jake Wagner, the defendant's mother and brother, and shoe print evidence from the crime scenes that matched shoes Angela bought for Jake and George for the night of the killings.

When Canepa concludes, Wagner IV's defense begins. The prosecution then gets the last word, with rebuttal, before the judge provides jury instruction.

Update 11:20 a.m.: Special Prosecutor Angela Canepa told jurors the evidence the prosecution presented shows the 2016 Pike County killings were a Wagner ""family affair.""

While no evidence or witness pointed to George Wagner IV shooting any of the eight victims, evidence does show he was intimately involved in the ""criminal enterprise"" and that he would not be someone ""who would ever sit one out, who would ever not be involved,"" she said.

Canepa told the nine women and three men of the jury that circumstantial evidence is important in the case. Shoe prints, spent bullets and weapons all tie the Wagners to the killings.

Before Canepa began her closing, Judge Randy Deering told the jury they would not be sequestered during their deliberations. He also informed them that death penalty would not be an option if they find Wagner IV guilty.

Previous reporting:

WAVERLY, Ohio – Lawyers are expected to make their closing arguments Monday in the Pike County murder trial of George Wagner IV.

When proceedings recessed last Tuesday for the Thanksgiving holiday break, Pike County Common Pleas Court Judge Randy Deering directed attorneys working to defend and prosecute Wagner IV to return at 9 a.m. to wrap up final discussion about instructions for the jury.

After that, the prosecution will present its closing, followed by the defense, with prosecutors then getting a second turn.

Once complete, Deering will read jury instructions and dismiss the panel of nine women and three men to begin their deliberations.

Deering said he expected the jury to get the case no later than Wednesday.

Deering has the option of sequestering the jury as they deliberate. Last week, however, he indicated that jurors would work in the courthouse jury room – noting that its small size would require photos, weapons, clothing and other physical evidence in the case be delivered to jurors' at their request.

Wagner IV entered a not guilty plea to eight counts of aggravated murder and 14 other charges related to the 2016 shooting deaths of the Rhoden family.

Prosecution witnesses said Wagner IV helped plan, carry out and cover up the homicides.

Wagner IV, testifying in his own defense, said he went to bed at 10 p.m. on the night of the crimes and only learned that seven Rhodens and one future family member were killed from TV news the next day.

Wagner IV's trial began Aug. 29. Brother Edward ""Jake"" Wagner and mother Angela Wagner pleaded guilty in the case last year. George ""Billy"" Wagner III, also pleading not guilty, will be tried next year.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/11/01/allison-fluke-ekren-sentence-isis/,Kansas woman who led ISIS battalion gets 20 years in prison,"A former schoolteacher from Kansas who became a rare female leader in the Islamic State and commanded her own battalion in Syria was sentenced Tuesday to 20 years in federal prison. Allison Fluke-Ekren admitted she trained more than 100 women — including girls as young as 10 years old — to use assault rifles, grenades and suicide explosives as the Islamic State battled U.S.-backed forces for control of Syria in 2017. Fluke-Ekren’s contributions to the Islamic State continued after her second, third and fourth husbands were killed while working for the terrorist group and a 5-year-old son died in a tank strike, according to court records.

Researchers of extremist movements say Fluke-Ekren, 42, is the first and so far only U.S. woman to be prosecuted for an Islamic State leadership role. Two of Fluke-Ekren’s children described her as an abuser who fantasized about carrying out terrorist strikes and who sought to indoctrinate those around her to kill “disbelievers.” Federal prosecutor Raj Parekh described Fluke-Ekren as the “empress of ISIS.”

“Let there be no doubt about what the purpose of this battalion was,” said Parekh, the first assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. He said that “it wasn’t for self-defense” and that a document from the Islamic State showed that a member of Fluke-Ekren’s brigade “wanted to be the first to carry out a suicide operation.”

Defense attorneys disputed the child-abuse allegations and characterized Fluke-Ekren as the leader of a battalion that never actually engaged in fighting.

“We didn’t even shoot a gun,” Fluke-Ekren said. “I’ve never seen a suicide bomb explode, or exploded one.”

Former friends have said Fluke-Ekren was a studious young mother who earned a biology degree at the University of Kansas, went to graduate school in Indiana and worked as a teacher in Kansas City, Mo., before moving with her children and second husband to Egypt in 2008. She then took a sharp turn toward extremism, estranged family members told U.S. investigators.

Fluke-Ekren grew up as Allison Elizabeth Brooks on an 81-acre farm in Overbrook, Kan., the daughter of a teacher and an Army veteran who served in Vietnam, prosecutors said.

“There is nothing in Fluke-Ekren’s background that can explain her conduct,” Parekh said at the sentencing. Fluke-Ekren’s father told U.S. authorities that she was “predisposed to zealotry” and “often looking for people to give her a difficult time for being Muslim.”

“Was she religious? Yes. She was from Middle America. Before she was Muslim, she was like a Bible-beating Christian,” Amy Amer, a former friend of Fluke-Ekren, told The Washington Post in June. Amer said she was taken aback when Fluke-Ekren started espousing extremist ideas.

Fluke-Ekren pleaded guilty this year to a conspiracy charge of providing material support to a terrorist organization, admitting that she aided terrorist groups while in Iraq, Libya and Syria from 2011 to 2019. Fluent in both English and Arabic, Fluke-Ekren’s assistance included analyzing documents for Ansar al-Sharia, the group behind the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans in 2012, according to her guilty plea. She also gave assistance to the al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, prosecutors said.

But it was in the Islamic State that Fluke-Ekren would attain prominent roles.

In 2016, Fluke-Ekren’s second husband oversaw Islamic State snipers in Syria, and she organized child care, medical services and education in the city of Raqqa, according to court documents. Fluke-Ekren trained women and young girls to use AK-47 rifles, grenades and explosive suicide belts in case male fighters needed help defending against enemy attacks, her plea documents say. One witness who received military training as a girl said Fluke-Ekren later told her that “it was important to kill the kuffar,” an Arabic word for disbelievers, the documents say.

As male fighters were losing ground in 2017 to the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, the Islamic State mayor of Raqqa named Fluke-Ekren the leader of the Khatiba Nusaybah, an all-female battalion. Fluke-Ekren’s group gave medical training and religious classes, as well as martial arts instruction. It also provided courses on vehicle bombings and how to pack a “go bag” with rifles and military supplies, according to court documents filed in June.

U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema imposed the maximum sentence allowed under Fluke-Ekren’s plea agreement. The judge said she did not find Fluke-Ekren’s statements during Tuesday’s hearing “wholly credible.” Fluke-Ekren said she had provided only “unwitting” support to Ansar al-Sharia in the aftermath of the Benghazi attacks and told the judge she was training women to handle weapons in Syria not for terrorist purposes, but to help prevent fatal accidents inside Syrian homes and to teach women self-defense in case enemy combatants attempted to sexually abuse them.

“The vast majority of my time was spent cooking, cleaning, taking children to doctors, putting antiseptic on scraped knees and mediating sibling disputes,” Fluke-Ekren said, often breaking into tears during her remarks to the judge.

Brinkema said that teaching women and girls to use “suicide vests cannot possibly be considered self-defense” and that she disagreed with Fluke-Ekren characterizing herself as a “passive dupe” who was led into terrorist activities by her second husband.

Witnesses said Fluke-Ekren planned different mass-casualty strikes, though she never carried out the attacks. A woman with Islamic State ties told investigators that Fluke-Ekren had the idea in 2014 to bomb a U.S. college in the Midwest. One of Fluke-Ekren’s daughters told U.S. investigators how the former Kansas mom “explained that she could go to a shopping mall in the United States, park a vehicle full of explosives in the basement or parking garage level of the structure, and detonate the explosives in the vehicle with a cell phone triggering device.” The daughter said Fluke-Ekren deemed any attack that did not kill a large number of people a “waste of resources,” according to court documents.

“In reality, the Khatiba Nussayeb had barely one hundred women, including members designated as babysitters, nurses, and cooks,” defense attorneys Joseph King and Sean Sherlock wrote in a sentencing brief. “The loosely organized group had no formal ranks, were not issued uniforms or weapons, never engaged in fighting, nor fired a shot against an enemy.”

In a court filing in August, Fluke-Ekren’s attorneys said her statements about carrying out terrorist attacks in the United States were responses to “the shock and horrors of war” she experienced after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces, or “U.S. or U.S.-led coalition forces,” killed Syrian civilians in bombings and airstrikes.

“In 2015 one of her children was killed, and another severely injured, from such an attack on a residential neighborhood,” King and Sherlock wrote. “She saw numerous friends, neighbors, and children killed in similar incidents during the war.”

The attorneys denied the abuse allegations from Fluke-Ekren’s children, calling them “inaccurate, exaggerated, hyperbolic, and in many cases completely false.” They said the allegations were disclosed to Fluke-Ekren for the first time in September.

Parekh said Fluke-Ekren unsuccessfully tried to form a female battalion for years, before Islamic State leaders authorized her plans in Raqqa. Fluke-Ekren was not charged with violent conduct, but the prosecutor argued in a sentencing brief that she encouraged another woman to carry out her own suicide attack and arranged to adopt her child.

Fluke-Ekren chose not to cooperate with U.S. investigators after her arrest, Parekh added.

“This defendant is probably a gold mine of intelligence,” Parekh said. “All the people that she’s met, all the co-conspirators that she’s trained — but she didn’t cooperate.”

After her second husband was killed in an airstrike, Fluke-Ekren married a specialist in unmanned aerial vehicles for the Islamic State who was working on “attaching chemical weapons onto drones to drop chemical bombs from the air,” according to court records. He was also killed in an airstrike. Fluke-Ekren’s fourth husband was the Islamic State official in charge of Raqqa’s defense during a siege by the Syrian Democratic Forces at the time he was killed.

Fluke-Ekren said she abandoned the Islamic State in 2019 and surrendered to Syrian authorities in the summer of 2021 “to protect her children from the difficulties of living in war-torn Syria,” her attorneys wrote in a filing. She was turned over to U.S. custody in January, after 11 years outside the United States.

One daughter who spoke at Tuesday’s hearing claimed that Fluke-Ekren forced her to marry an Islamic State fighter when she was 13 years old and he was 17 years old. The daughter claimed that the Islamic State fighter raped her. Fluke-Ekren claimed that it was her daughter’s choice to marry the man.

In a recorded call with the daughter in January 2021 that Parekh played in court, Fluke-Ekren said, “You can’t give up, because that’s the only time that you lose.”",Q4
https://www.yahoo.com/news/supreme-court-counsel-pushes-back-235316161.html,Supreme Court counsel pushes back on inquiry from Democratic lawmakers over report of 2014 leak,"WASHINGTON – A Supreme Court official Monday pushed back on explosive allegations this month that a former anti-abortion advocate got a heads-up about the outcome of a 2014 decision dealing with religious objections to contraception.

A letter from the Supreme Court's legal counsel, Ethan Torrey, reiterated an earlier denial from Associate Justice Samuel Alito that he told an intermediary about the outcome of the case and it stressed that ""there is nothing to suggest that Justice Alito's actions violated ethics standards."" The letter was a response to an inquiry from two prominent Democratic lawmakers after The New York Times published the allegations.

The two-page letter was a rare instance of the high court making its response to lawmakers public. It comes as the Supreme Court is apparently still investigating the leak of a draft opinion this year in a landmark abortion case that ultimately overturned Roe v. Wade. Alito wrote the majority opinion in this year's case.

In a story published by The New York Times this month, a former anti-abortion advocate said he had knowledge of the outcome of the court's 2014 opinion in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby before the decision was released. The court decided in that case that for-profit companies may deny contraception coverage to employees based on religious objections.

Associate Justice Samuel Alito, author of the Supreme Court's landmark opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, waved away criticism of the ruling from foreign leaders in remarks in July 2022 at a religious summit in Rome.

The Rev. Rob Schenck says he was informed of the court's decision by Gayle Wright, a donor to his evangelical nonprofit, Faith and Action. Wright, according to The Times, had told Schenck that she would be dining with Alito and his wife and that she thought she could learn the status of the case.

Alito, at the time the story published, said in a statement that the ""allegation that the Wrights were told the outcome of the decision in the Hobby Lobby case, or the authorship of the opinion of the court, by me or my wife, is completely false.” He added that he ""never detected"" any effort to sway his official or private actions, and if he had, he would have ""strongly objected.""

A day after The Times published its story, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., who chair the respective subcommittees on federal courts in their chambers, wrote to Chief Justice John Roberts. The lawmakers pressed Roberts on whether an investigation had been opened into the allegations.

They also asked whether the court had ""reevaluated any of its practices, procedures, or rules related to judicial ethics"" or the rule surrounding how justices report gifts or in light of the allegations from Schenck.

In the court's response Monday, Torrey noted that federal court rules ban judges from receiving a gift from a person with business before the court. In addition, Torrey said, the term ""gift"" excludes ""social hospitality based on personal relationships as well as modest items, such as food and refreshments.""

Relevant rules ""balance preventing gifts that might undermine public confidence in the judiciary and allowing judges to maintain normal personal friendships,"" the letter said.

In a joint statement, Whitehouse and Johnson said ""the Supreme Court reiterated Justice Alito's denials but did not substantively answer any of our questions."" The court's letter, the two Democrats said, ""is an embodiment of the problems at the court around ethics issues.""

https://www.city-journal.org:443/nyc-war-on-meritocracy,"“Equity” and Excellence, Four Years Later","Four years ago, Mayor Bill de Blasio proclaimed that New York City’s renowned specialized high schools didn’t “look like” the city and declared war on their meritocratic admissions processes. In his announcement, de Blasio cited the familiar woke mantra that achieving the all-important goal of “equity” would not compromise excellence. Four years later, how has excellence fared? Thanks to data recently obtained by parents who used Freedom of Information requests on perhaps the two best-known specialized high schools—Bronx Science and Stuyvesant—we now have answers.

New York State’s 1971 Hecht-Calandra law established that the specialized high schools must admit all the highest-scoring students (and only these) from a blind-graded entrance exam, the Specialized High School Admission Test (SHSAT). To many progressives, such meritocratic admissions violate equity. De Blasio couldn’t persuade the state legislature to repeal Hecht-Calandra, however, in part because Asian parents mounted a passionate grassroots fight. Thwarted, the mayor mandated a workaround of Hecht-Calandra by abusing Discovery programs—backdoors for admission to participating specialized high schools, permitted under Hecht-Calandra. Under Discovery, a disadvantaged student who missed the SHSAT score cutoff at all specialized high schools could still enter one by securing a teacher recommendation and completing a summer catch-up program at that school.

Hecht-Calandra clearly intended the SHSAT to be the main entrance into the specialized high schools, but it didn’t explicitly limit the size of the Discovery exceptions. De Blasio exploited this apparent loophole by throwing wide open the Discovery backdoor, expanding it to one-fifth of every specialized high school, at the expense of the meritocratic SHSAT. But this is where a key protective proviso in Hecht-Calandra kicks in. Section 1, 12(d) of Hecht-Calandra states that Discovery programs must be run “without in any manner interfering with the academic level of these schools.” In any manner is very strong language; it leaves no wiggle room to compromise academic levels or negotiate interpretations. To comply with this requirement, Discovery admits must perform academically at least as well as SHSAT admits.

This protective proviso is crucial for Bronx Science and Stuyvesant. Founded in 1938 and 1904, respectively, these two STEM schools have graduated 12 Nobel Prize-winners in science between them, as well as Fields medalists in mathematics and winners of the Abel, Wolf, and Turing prizes. Average SAT scores at the two schools, where about half the students are poor enough to qualify for the federal free and reduced-price school lunch program, are 1440 and 1480, respectively, comparing favorably with scores of top schools with far wealthier demographics, such as Phillips Exeter (1450), Dalton (1440), and Great Neck South (1390). Hecht-Calandra’s protective proviso is key to preserving such rare excellence against an abusive expansion of Discovery.

To settle the question of whether Discovery admits are as high-performing as SHSAT admits, we need a metric for educational performance. The politico-education establishment likes to cite graduation rates or grades, but it is well-known that these metrics are plagued by perverse incentives and are untrustworthy. Instead, scores from New York State’s High School Regents Examinations provide a third-party, consistent, meaningful standard for comparison. If Discovery admits are not academically inferior to SHSAT admits, then their Regents Exam scores should be at least as good as those of SHSAT students.

The data show that this is not the case.

The graph below, using data from the parents’ Freedom of Information request, compares the average Regents scores of SHSAT admits, in green, against the average scores of Discovery admits, in red, at Bronx Science and Stuyvesant for the classes of 2022 and 2023, in all six high school Regents exams provided by the Department of Education.

Charts by author, based on Department of Education data

As the graph clearly shows, Discovery admits trail SHSAT admits in academic performance—in Stuyvesant’s case, by a full letter-grade step.

Additionally, comparing the six pairs of Regents average scores separately confirms that Discovery admits function at lower academic levels than SHSAT admits. In every Regents exam at both schools, Discovery admits underperform SHSAT admits, and by a full letter-grade step of A– to B+ in every subject and in every year, other than biology in 2022.

A letter-grade step difference cannot be dismissed. The politico-education establishment might say that a B+ is “good enough”—after all, they can’t even get half of New York State’s kids to grade-level proficiency. But Stuyvesant and Bronx Science are intended to achieve rarefied levels of excellence. Besides, even if the politicians and administrators can’t grasp or don’t care about achieving such excellence, the Hecht-Calandra law requires them to protect it. A class averaging B+ is very different from a class averaging A– in terms of classroom energy, learning pace, and depth of material. Stuyvesant students know that, all else being equal, classmates with an A– average go to an altogether different league of colleges than classmates with a B+ average.

The damage to excellence is further compounded by the sheer scale of Discovery expansion. When as much as one-fifth of a school is of a distinctly lower caliber, necessary downgrades will seep through the entire school. For example, the school might have to reduce offerings of multivariable calculus—the kind of advanced course that makes Stuyvesant preeminent—to free resources to increase offerings of Algebra I, which many SHSAT admits skip. The school might even eliminate multivariable calculus altogether because, in the language of equity, nobody should be “stigmatized.” This is not idle speculation; it happened in a similar situation.

What do the findings mean? First and foremost, they mean that the expanded Discovery programs are illegal—Hecht-Calandra’s key proviso that the Discovery program not interfere in any manner with academic levels at Bronx Science and Stuyvesant is being violated. To many, this is not news. Knowledgeable sources have long confided that the expanded Discovery programs take in too many underperforming students, who are then blindly passed along by the summer programs. Despite the obvious need, there is no honest testing of Discovery students at the end of the summer. The expanded Discovery programs must either be fixed or rolled back. (It also bears noting that the Discovery program wasn’t just expanded; its eligibility requirements were manipulated as well. Both changes led to claims that the expansion is racially prejudiced against otherwise-qualified Asian-Americans. Those claims, though important, are the subject of ongoing litigation and are not the focus here.)

Second, the data disprove again (as this paper by Will Dobbie and Roland Fryer and this analysis by Metis explain) the unsubstantiated claims by equity advocates that the SHSAT doesn’t predict academic performance. The data show exactly the opposite. Students admitted outside the SHSAT, and hence with lower SHSAT scores, performed worse than students admitted by the SHSAT. We could not ask for a better comparison.

Finally, while the data show that equity is indeed incompatible with excellence at Bronx Science and Stuyvesant, it would be a mistake to dismiss these data as mere special cases. It’s just that in these instances, we got the data; elsewhere, we had to learn from leaks and whistleblowers. Around the country, top meritocratic exam schools such as Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Northern Virginia, Lowell in San Francisco, and Boston Latin are all seeing their excellence sacrificed on the altar of equity. Nor are exam schools the only battlegrounds where excellence is under assault. Lotteries replacing admissions criteria at non-exam schools, weak curricula further dumbed down, grades inflated, Gifted and Talented programs hollowed out, and the number of charter schools capped despite demonstrated excellence—all are being done in the name of equity. Aware that parents are wising up, equity advocates are learning to camouflage their agenda with the latest verbiage about social and emotional learning, but their quest to tear down excellence is unmistakable by its fruits.

Families that want rigorous education for their children face a choice. They must either vote with their feet and leave the schools, or use the political process to remove equity ideology and restore meritocracy. Excellence is too important to ruin.

https://armenianweekly.com/2022/10/12/armenians-must-side-with-indigenous-land-rights-against-the-occupier-us-government/,Armenians must side with indigenous land rights against the occupier US government,"It is widely known that the Armenian Diaspora in America faces the existential threat of assimilation into American society. We typically view this assimilationist crisis through the angle of loss of culture and identity; that is to say, in what ways we cease to engage in Armenian identity-affirming traditions – cultural, political, etc. What we don’t often focus on is what superfluous and negative beliefs we acquire from the culture of our host country.

Specifically, one factor to focus on is the political assimilation that occurs within the American school system and society. After years of conditioning within pro-American classes, most Armenian-Americans develop the same attitude as their peers toward the American state and Indigenous rights in America, despite the fact that the mainstream narrative is counter-productive and harmful for the Armenian people.

At best, our people learn about the oppressive policies of the American government, but associate such heinousness and the existence of Indigenous Americans in general with the past; even the most truthful and in-depth of settings does not even dare to question the legitimacy of the existence of the American state. Most people, however, learn a narrative that entirely absolves the United States of culpability in past and present crimes and not only legitimizes, but glorifies that institution.

We must first establish that the United States government is responsible for the genocide of the Indigenous people of America. This is a fact that is accepted by the vast majority of historians and proven by the immense decrease in the Indigenous population of the United States since its founding (a decrease in the scale of hundreds of thousands). The United States government engaged in the wholesale massacre of non-combatant innocents, forced relocations and death marches, as well as breaking treaties with and occupying the lands of Indigenous nations. The criminal US regime, which has been founded upon and continues to occupy stolen land, now has created a settler-colonial state to force Indigenous people to assimilate into or be marginalized within American society.

Armenians are no strangers to these sorts of crimes against humanity. For over a millennium, we have faced the genocidal and settler-colonial regimes of the Turkish fascist state in its various forms: the Seljuk Empire, Ottoman Empire and Turkish Republic. Most of us do not speak our ancestral dialects, live in our ancestral villages and cities, know the location of our forefathers’ homes and graves, and so on. Those Armenians who still live in the Turkish state are subject to extreme discrimination and are prevented from fully expressing their culture and identity out of fear of reprisal from the racist government.

Coming from a similar background as Indigenous Americans, we must then, as Armenians, stand against the genocidal American regime, in solidarity with other oppressed Indigenous peoples, marching forward against the force of settler-colonialism. Morally speaking, why should we – victims of genocide, ethnic cleansing and settler colonialism – stand with the perpetrators of such heinous crimes, rather than the victims? Each Armenian who actually supports even the idea of the American state legitimizes an institution which inflicts upon the original peoples of this continent that which the Turks have done and continue to do to us. Moreover, our great eternal enemy, the Turkish fascist state, is part of the same Western coalition of genocidal murderers – that is, the so-called “Free World” – of which the United States lauds itself as being the leader and representative.

For those faithful to the ideology of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF/Tashnagtsutiun), the reasoning is even simpler and the necessity is even more imperative. The ARF Program posits that “Every nation’s natural and inalienable rights include its homeland – its historical, territorial habitat – as its distinct environment, vital to creativity, survival, and development.” And yet, the Indigenous nations of this country do not have this inalienable right, because they have been victim to the very “capitalism, imperialism, totalitarianism, and colonialism” that the ARF Program wholeheartedly condemns.

This line of logic even flows from the national (azkayin) ideology of our party, rather than ARF socialist ideological thought, through the lenses of which one could examine the role of capitalism in creating and encouraging the development of settler-colonialism in the Americas and the solutions to it within the socio-economic, rather than national-revolutionary sphere.

Why, then, should we have a state in our homeland, as opposed to other stateless Indigenous peoples? After all, to side with the American government on the issue of its legitimacy is to tacitly admit that the Indigenous peoples of the United States are not deserving of a state on their united homeland. This can only be based on two potential suppositions: either a) that we, unlike other peoples, are deserving of a state, or that b) the Indigenous people of America, specifically, are not deserving of a state. Either way, both suppositions are unacceptable because the first is chauvinist, while the second is racist: the Armenian Revolutionary Federation is neither of these things and actively eschews both in its program.

With all this said, our path as Armenians, guided by the moral-ideological values of our forefathers (revolution, socialism, democracy and nationalism), must be to strike against, rather than support, those who inflict suffering and oppression upon others. It is a lamentable fact that we view ourselves within a vacuum – as a people, alone and afraid, without the help of others, and thus, not compelled to aid others. Instead, we must view ourselves as ideological fighters in the global struggle against imperialism and capitalism. As soon as we have reframed our mindset, we will find that others will help us in our struggle; unfortunately, only we can be the ones who take the first steps of solidarity, as we are a small, relatively unknown nation whose interests conflict with those of Western powers and have not perpetrated any recent radical actions surrounding our just cause to catch the world’s attention.

The future to which we look forward must not be a vignette centered solely around Armenia, but a world in which we have taken back Western Armenia and all of our historic homeland from cruel oppressors, in which the illegitimate American occupier government has been overthrown by the solidarity of oppressed peoples, in which the Indigenous people of America once again rule their own homeland, and in which the workers of various countries have taken back their just rights, allowing us to coexist in an international brotherhood of socialist peoples, with the utmost respect for both national independence and individual rights.

Of course, we need not be involved in all struggles (whether based on class or national rights) as active participants (indeed, we scarcely have truly committed fighters in our own struggle); yet, our ideological and moral support should be with the oppressed peoples of the world, not the oppressors. Though this path may be long and arduous, it begins with breaking the shackles of ամերիկամոլութիւն (love of America) that have been forced upon our people by the chauvinist, hyper-American attitudes and pressures of the mid-to-late 20th century.

It is only once we begin to be Armenians, rather than Armenian-Americans, that we are ready to participate in this international anti-imperialist struggle by sincerely fighting against the fascist Turkish-Azeri oppressor and completing our duty of leaving the Diaspora and returning to our ancestral lands. In this grand struggle, there is only victory or martyrdom, freedom or death. Ազատութիւն կամ մահ։",Q4

That’s not the case in Franklin County where one candidate is on the ballot despite being thrown out of office following a WRAL Investigation.

Patricia Chastain was removed from office two years ago following our investigation into her involvement in a dispute between two neighbors. That dispute had been settled by a judge, until Chastain got involved.

""I have reviewed her file. By law, I’m obligated at this point to mediate this case,"" Chastain told a homeowner in video obtained by WRAL Investigates

Louisburg attorney Jeffrey Thompson told WRAL Investigates that’s well beyond Chastain’s duties, ""In no way shape or form is that her job.

Thompson filed a complaint asserting Chastain inserted herself in a 2020 local property dispute outside her jurisdiction. That interaction and various other allegations of misconduct beyond her role led to a hearing and eventually a judge’s decision to remove her from office.

""It’s very unusual. You’ve had some district attorneys and others that have been removed, but never a clerk of court,"" Louisburg attorney Boyd Sturges said.

Sturges argued to oust Chastain. The decision was appealed and remanded back to Judge Thomas Lock, who made adjustments to his ruling, but still barred her from holding the office.

However, when voters go the polls in Franklin County on Tuesday they’ll see Chastain’s name on the ballot. In a split opinion, the North Carolina Court of Appeals decided Chastain could run. Whether she could serve if elected is another legal battle.

Chastain changed from Democrat to Republican and ran unopposed in the primary. Shelley Dickerson, the current clerk, is the Democrat on the ballot.

""She feels like she was unjustifiably removed,"" attorney Robert Zaytoun told WRAL Investigates.

Zaytoun is leading Chastain’s latest appeal. He hopes voters send a message to the courts.

""So, I believe it is courageous of her run and put her face straight in the lion’s mouth,"" Zaytoun said. ""She wants it to be the will of the people and not a small cabal.""

Some voters WRAL Investigates spoke with seemed unaware or unfazed by the Chastain dilemma. Lifelong resident Michael Hicks offers his analysis.

""Things don’t always make sense,"" Hicks said. ""Franklin County is Franklin County, and I think they have their own sense of rules.""

Voters and the courts could ultimately decide who will be the next clerk.",Q4
https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/california-environmental-law-policy-4933479/,California Environmental Law & Policy Update - October 2022 #2,"U.S. Supreme Court justices on October 3 appeared open to limiting the reach of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) authority to protect wetlands from pollution under the 1972 federal Clean Water Act (CWA), but not go so far as to rule that EPA could never police wetlands like swamps, marshes, and berms that are near but not connected to regulated waters. At issue in this matter is what test courts should use to ascertain what constitutes “waters of the United States” under the CWA. The answer will help determine whether wetlands adjacent to navigable waters fall within the EPA’s purview, which could subject the property to regulation and require the owners to obtain federal permits to carry out construction. The ruling, expected by the end of June 2023, will have broad implications for the applicability and enforcement of the CWA by agencies and citizen groups.

News Governor Newsom signs ban on ‘forever chemicals’ in cosmetics and clothes, but vetoes tracking program The Hill – September 30 Governor Gavin Newsom last Thursday signed two “first in the nation” bills that will ban certain cancer-linked per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from cosmetic products and textiles in the state beginning in 2025. However, Governor Newsom vetoed a third bill that would have created a publicly accessible database of consumer items that contain these toxic compounds. The first bill signed into law, Assembly Bill 2771, will prohibit the manufacture, sale, and delivery of cosmetic products that contain PFAS. The second bill, Assembly Bill 1817, will bar the manufacture, distribution, and sale of “any new, not previously owned” textiles that contain PFAS, with a few exceptions. The bill will also require manufacturers to provide a certificate of compliance indicating that their products do not contain PFAS. READ California water agencies float Colorado River water cuts proposal Associated Press – October 6 California water agencies that rely on the parched Colorado River said on October 5 they can reduce their use by one-tenth starting in 2023 in response to calls for cuts from the federal government. The agencies, which supply water to farmers and millions of people in Southern California, laid out their proposal in a letter to the U.S. Department of the Interior. It comes as drought exacerbated by climate change continues to diminish the river, and months after the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation first called on users to voluntarily limit their reliance on its water. California, which shares the river’s water with six other states, tribes, and Mexico, has rights to the single largest share and is the last to lose water in times of shortage.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said on September 30 that it will let the pipeline’s owner, Amplify Energy, remove and replace the damaged portion of pipe from the ocean floor, a spot about 160 feet deep and roughly five miles off shore. If the repairs pass federal inspections – including stress tests aimed at preventing future ruptures – Amplify said it hopes to bring its San Pedro Bay operations back online during the first quarter of 2023.

The Shipyard has been slated for a sizable development for decades, but first the Navy had to address contamination from years of sandblasting of ships and use of radioactive materials. In a memo from the U.S. EPA, the agency overseeing the Navy’s cleanup effort, a top official signaled the Navy may be allowed to stop short of what the city considers “full cleanup.” With a new round of testing underway, the city soon will have to decide whether to accept the land if it is in less than pristine condition.

Reversing earlier calls made during both the Obama and Trump administrations, FWS said the San Francisco Bay-Delta distinct population segment of longfin smelt should be added to the list of endangered species.

http://www.5tjt.com/a-glance-back/,A Glance Back,"By R’ Nison Gordon, z’l

Translated by P. Samuels

The following is a translation of an article written by Reb Nison Gordon, z’l, which appeared in the erev Rosh Hashanah 5720 edition of Dos Yiddishe Vort.

Once again, a year flew by, and the last page is torn out of the calendar, to make room for the newly arriving 5720.

Just like every year at this time, one wants to draw a summary and make a reckoning of where we are up to in this world and to see what the future holds for us.

Where is Judaism, real authentic Judaism, up to in America at the threshold of 5720? Are there grounds for the optimism that’s apparent in certain circles, that Judaism is becoming stronger from day to day? And how true is the pessimism that’s blowing like a cold wind in other circles, saying that Judaism is shrinking daily and will soon be relegated to a forlorn corner?

If you speak to someone who deals with yeshivos and education, he will infect you with his enthusiasm as he tells you about saved families, about children who revolutionized homes, koshering kitchens, taking their father to shul, and convincing their mothers to light candles Friday night.

If you speak to someone returning from a trip across the country, he will bemoan the older generation, the generation of immigrants, which is passing on without leaving any spiritual heirs, the old shuls that are desolate and the new ones being built with parking lots for the automobiles that come in honor of Shabbos. He will express sorrow about large cities whose Jewish population numbers in tens of thousands, which don’t have any kosher restaurants, and about assimilation and mixed marriages that are multiplying like mushrooms after a rainstorm.

It is truly difficult to draw a certain conclusion when so many considerations are not in harmony. The bottom line depends on which perspective you accept, and who knows who is really right and who is wrong.

The most correct approach would probably be to describe the conditions both as better and worse at the same time. There are areas and cities where the situation is getting worse and where assimilation and indifference have the upper hand.

All would agree that in one sense an improvement is the fact that baruch Hashem there are those who protest, powers which do not allow themselves to be outshouted, and do not go along with the flow.

A most important fact to consider is that a large portion of this power lies in the hands of American youths, youths who are unsophisticated, but whose main desire is to live as Torah true Jews, loyal to Hashem and to His Torah.

The Growth of Yeshivos and Their Difficult Struggle

When someone possesses a valuable diamond, which he brags about, it is only normal and expected that he watches over it and protects it from any calamity.

Unfortunately, in the case of our growing yeshivos, kain yirbu (may they continue to multiply) the opposite is true.

The more the yeshivos grow, in quantity and quality, the more difficult their financial situation is becoming, and the harder it is for the parents to meet the tuition requests. According to the latest statistics, America has more than 200 yeshivos, actually almost 250, with a total of a quarter of a million students. The yeshivos aren’t only increasing in number, in quantity, but also in quality. The older students now graduating from yeshivos are first-class talmidei chachamim (Torah scholars), young men with a mission and a sense of responsibility. They are concerned about the state of Judaism, and they are worried about the future of Torah.

“Eidims oif kest” [Note: An expression used to describe the son-in-law who devoted his days to Torah study while being financially supported by his father-in-law) is not just a term of the past that one must talk about with nostalgia. Each of us could find in our immediate social circle a family that has an eidim oif kest who is learning Torah either in Lakewood, Spring Valley, or Bais HaTalmid, or in Gur Arye or the other Kollels whose names escape me now.

At the beginning of the yeshiva movement in America, a number of Torah giants expressed hope in the local American youth, a hope which was proven true across the country, wherever a young ben Torah happened to land.

The future of Jews in America, not just Judaism but Jews as a viable group, lies in the further development and growth of the yeshiva movement. This is a fact about which all agree: the religious Jews with joy and the irreligious with fear.

And yet, after all is said and done, the yeshiva movement is not threatened by outside opponents, but rather by its own internal factions.

Jews do not give enough money for yeshivos, way less than the yeshivos deserve!

Understandably, there are enough excuses. The Land of Israel with its campaigns and drives takes the front row and pushes the yeshivos onto the back burner.

The yeshivos themselves are not organized among themselves and each one is chaotic on its own.

And just like the excuses that stood in the way of founding the yeshiva movement were not valid, so too should the excuses regarding supporting their existence not be validated.

We happen to be known as a nation of wise and knowledgeable people, who find a solution to every problem, so where is our wisdom and intelligence to ensure our basic continued existence?

Again About the Ban of the Roshei Yeshiva

[Note: this is referring to a ban issued by eleven roshei yeshiva outlawing Orthodox rabbis and organizations to have anything to do with those of Conservative or Reform persuasion.]

5719 did not bring any change in the fight for separating the rov and the rabbi.

The ban issued by eleven roshei yeshiva, about whom nobody doubts in the greatness in Torah, did not stop the organizational flirting between Orthodox rabbis and Conservative and Reform rabbis in the New York Board of Rabbis and the Synagogue Council of America. [Note: both organizations which include all factions].

So far, the newly founded Metropolitan Board of Orthodox Rabbis, which is supposed to be against the New York Board of Rabbis has not proven to be as effective as its founders had hoped. The national Orthodox Rabbinical organizations, which should have been the first to encourage the Metropolitan Board, disagreed among themselves about which stand to take regarding the young rabbis of the Metropolitan, and in the end their decision was to keep quiet—not to argue and not to praise.

In the Histadrus HaRabonim (an Orthodox organization) itself, there are those who want to uphold the ban practically, as one could see from the vote at their recent convention, but they are helpless without the help and support of those who issued the ban.

So here too, we ask the same question: where is our wisdom and advice to ensure the purity and holiness of the rabbinate?

A Bit Of Gratification From Mound Clemens

While seeking a positive development in the news of religious life throughout the past year, one mentions the victory of Rabbi Boruch Litvin, of Mount Clemens, who won a court case against those who wanted to break the mechitza in his shul.

Of course the court did not mix in to the “between Hashem and man” issue of yes or no having a mechitzah. But the court did rule that an Orthodox Jew who is not allowed to pray in a shul without a mechitzah is robbed of his rights to enter the shul if the mechitzah is broken. In other words, those who break the mechitzah in an Orthodox shul are committing a sin “between man and his fellow man” against the members and congregants who won’t, because of that, enter the shul. The ruling is surely important and far reaching, but unfortunately, I cannot share in the unlimited joy of the official Orthodox statements issued when the ruling came out.

A court ruling will not build mechitzos in shuls with mixed seating. In the best-case scenario, it could give some stubborn people scattered here and there, a precedent to prevent the demolition of their shuls.

The Mt. Clemens victory is definitely a great moment of triumph for one individual Jew, Reb Boruch Litwin, whose stubbornness and endurance led to the fact that an American court openly recognized that a Jew who wants to conduct himself as the Shulchan Aruch describes, cannot be robbed of his rights by those who want to institute new guidelines.

Reb Boruch Litwin is now planning to publish a sefer with all the resposa and documents that would show a clear picture, for the first time, of the Orthodox viewpoint regarding the mechitzah.

Reb Boruch Litwin surely deserves the praise of the Orthodox community. May those like him multiply among the Jewish people.

Minor Items Which Show Great Things

It seems that Judaism cannot be measured by the same barometer as today’s modern polls and investigations.

Sometimes there are minor items or events that the professional pollster wouldn’t even stop at, yet they talk volumes. Here are just a few examples:

The Jewish community of Queens, composed of a few towns that are part of “suburbia” celebrated a Chanukas HaBayis of a new, modern mikvah that was erected right near Grand Central Parkway.

Whoever spent last summer in the Catskills, surely noticed that the “country” area is becoming more and more Jewish. Yeshiva oriented summer camps, including Camp Agudah and Camp Bnos, a few religious hotels, and more religious bungalow colonies transferred parts of religious Jewish life from the city.

The sefarim competition between the publishers of holy sefarim shows that there is a market about which to compete. The various versions of Shas as well as the other editions of holy sefarim show that there are masses of Jewish homes with shelves full of sefarim, and what’s even more important to note is that most of the purchasers of these sefarim are American-born bnei Torah.

I think that these are minor items which get swallowed among the general happenings, but they disclose, and encourage a lot.",Q4
https://www.gadsdentimes.com/story/news/local/alabama/2022/12/05/ag-denies-execution-moratorium-allows-for-review/69701395007/,"AG says 'no moratorium' on executions, but will allow for review","Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said Monday afternoon that “there is no moratorium” on executions in Alabama, but he will still allow for an efficient review of the state’s execution process.

“I stand before you today to be very clear: Insofar as I and my office are concerned, there is no moratorium, nor will there be, on capital punishment in Alabama,” Marshall said.

Gov. Kay Ivey in late November called for the suspension of executions in Alabama for a “top-to-bottom review” after prison staff failed to complete a second straight execution. Marshall indicated that he won’t request any new execution dates before Ivey’s office carries out its review, so long as it doesn’t cause an “unreasonable” delay.

“What I want to make sure is … that we’ve given [Ivey] an opportunity to do this review, … to make sure that I hear from her that there is confidence that we have the ability to execute,” Marshall said. “…I’m also sitting here telling you that we’re not going to stand very long in a delay.”

Ivey's spokesperson, Gina Maiola, said “discussions have already begun” regarding the review of the Alabama Department of Corrections' execution process. Marshall added that he has not spoken with Ivey directly, but that he is “looking forward to [their] conversation.”

There are no pending execution dates before the Alabama Supreme Court and no scheduled executions in Alabama, Marshall said.

Marshall’s office solely has power to request an execution date from the Alabama Supreme Court.

On Nov. 17, officials called off the execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith as staff was unable to set the necessary IV lines for the lethal injection. Alan Miller’s execution was similarly called off just two months before because of issues finding a vein.

Marshall blamed the failure to carry out the executions on Smith and Miller for filing federal court challenges to their death sentences that were not resolved until as late as 10 p.m. of the day of their scheduled executions.

Smith was scheduled to be executed for the contract killing of Elizabeth Dorlene Sennett in 1988. Miller was sentenced to death for the killing of three men in two workplace shootings in Shelby County in 1999.

Alabama has since reached an agreement to not attempt a second lethal injection on Miller, but it may use nitrogen gas to execute him in the future. The state still does not have a protocol in place for the untried method that was approved in 2018, but Marshall said the state is in the “final stages” of developing it.

Advertisement

At first glance, this looks like a relatively easy case. The Supreme Court said that “schools” were among those few “sensitive places” where there’s a historical tradition of banning firearms, so that must mean that the university’s gun ban is in-line with the Constitution, right? As Michigan Supreme Court Justice David Viviano wrote in a concurrence to the order sending Wade v. University of Michigan back to the court of appeals, it’s not nearly as cut and dried an issue.

To support its threshold analysis, the Court of Appeals relied on the statement in Dist of Columbia v Heller, 554 US 570, 626-627 (2008), that the Second Amendment did not disturb “longstanding prohibitions on . . . laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings . . . .” In the present case, the Court of Appeals’ entire “historical analysis” was to examine one dictionary from 1828 to determine whether universities were considered “school[s]” in 1868. Even if one concludes that the Court of Appeals reached the correct result, this paltry review of the main question is inadequate. Moreover, it is not at all apparent that Heller’s brief discussion of sensitive places was intended to establish a rule that all entities historically known as “schools” could permissibly ban firearms, meaning the only question that would remain for future cases is whether the entity at issue was considered a “school.” Nor is it even clear that the Court meant to include universities and colleges in its reference to “schools,” let alone to say that such locations can completely ban firearms. See Note, Guns on Campus: Continuing Controversy, 38 J C & U L 663, 667-668 (2012) (noting that Heller did not address guns on university campuses or define “schools” to include higher education).

Advertisement

Viviano went on to describe two different areas of historical analysis that he’d like to see from the appellate court. First, whether there were any similar regulations dealing with bearing arms on university and college campuses at the time the Second and Fourteenth Amendments were ratified. Viviano notes that in his own initial analysis he’s found some laws that contain “partial restrictions”, but none that come close to the complete ban in effect on the University of Michigan campus.

The second line of historical analysis suggested by Viviano is whether or not traditional college campuses are even a good historical analogue for “large modern campuses like the University of Michigan’s.” Viviano wonders whether modern campuses are “so dispersed and multifaceted that a total campus ban would now cover areas that historically would not have had any restrictions?”

The University of Michigan itself occupies nearly one-tenth of Ann Arbor. Many areas on campus, such as roadways, open areas, shopping districts, or restaurants, might not fit the “sensitive place” model suggested by Heller—they may instead be more historically analogous to other locations that did not have gun restrictions. And because the campus is so entwined with the surrounding community, the ban might also burden carrying rights on locations outside campus, as many individuals will regularly go from campus to off-campus environments, even in a single trip; because they cannot bring a gun on campus, they will not feasibly be able to bring the gun to the off-campus locations either.

It’s an excellent point, and one that strikes at the heart of several of the post-Bruen restrictions on the right to carry that we’ve seen implemented or introduced in blue states over the past four months. Bans on concealed carry in public transportation, for example, not only prevent those who rely on it from being able to bear arms while on a city bus or subway, but throughout the course of their daily routine as well.

With the case going back to the court of appeals it will likely be several months before we get a decision, and Justice Viviano’s concurrence suggests that upholding the U of M gun ban won’t be as easy as gun control activists are hoping for. We’ll keep an eye on this case for any future developments, but in the meantime Michigan gun owners should be aware that the ban remains in effect for the time being.

A note from Cam: Now that the midterms are over, we need to look ahead to the threats gun owners face in Washington, D.C. and statehouses around the country, as well as support pro-Second Amendment officials and legislation to protect and secure our right to keep and bear arms.

https://city-countyobserver.com/todd-rokita-wins-latest-covid-vaccine-victory/,Todd Rokita Wins Latest COVID Vaccine Victory – City-County Observer,"Attorney General Todd Rokita wins latest COVID vaccine victory over Bidenâ€™s executive overreach in a case involving federal contractors

DECEMBER 20, 2022

Attorney General Todd Rokita has prevailed in yet another legal fight against President Joe Bidenâ€™s executive overreach in the form of draconian COVID vaccine mandates.

This time, in a lawsuit filed by Indiana and two other plaintiff states, a U.S. appeals court has struck down a rule requiring vaccination for anyone working for federal contractors.

â€œHoosiers and all Americans should have the liberty to make their own decisions on whether to get vaccinated,â€ Attorney General Rokita said. â€œThat includes individuals who happen to work as federal contractors. No one should have to fear losing their jobs just because they opt against getting a shot.â€

In affirming a district courtâ€™s injunction, the appeals court observed that President Bidenâ€™s use of the federal Procurement Act to claim executive power to impose the mandate on third-party contractors is â€œtruly unprecedented.â€

Previously, Attorney General Rokita has also prevailed in cases involving 1) Bidenâ€™s Occupational Safety and Health Administration vaccine mandate, which would have applied to anyone working for a company employing 100 or more people and 2) Bidenâ€™s Head Start mandate, which would have required all staff and volunteers in Head Start preschool programs to be masked and vaccinated â€” and even required masks on children ages 2 and older.

Sharif was shot dead in Kenya allegedly by the local police on the night of October 23.

Initially, the Kenyan media quoted the local police as saying that Sharif was shot dead in a case of “mistaken identity”.

However, later reports reconstructed the events surrounding the killing, stating that an occupant in Sharif’s car at the time of his killing was believed to have shot at paramilitary General Service Unit (GSU) officers.

To “inquire into the facts of the incident”, the Pakistan government formed a three-member commission, comprising led by retired judge Abdul Shakoor Paracha and comprising Additional Inspector General of Police Usman Anwar and Intelligence Bureau Deputy Director General (DDG) Omar Shahid Hamid.

Paracha said on Sunday he had informed the government that the commission would not be able to proceed with the inquiry because Sharif’s mother rejected the commission and send her request to the chief justice of Pakistan.

Parachi added that it would not be “legally sustainable” that DDG Hamid could be a part of the commission based on his previous findings”. Additionally, he said a media representative being a commission member was necessary.",Q4

This was the group’s first national meeting since the Teamsters union rammed through a sellout contract at UPS.

UAW President Shawn Fain (left) and TDU co-founder Ken Paff [Photo: Teamsters for a Democratic Union]

TDU promoted that deal as one of the greatest in the history of the Teamsters union, but in reality it fell far below workers’ demands and leaves nearly 200,000 part-timers in poverty. It also opens the door for UPS to eliminate warehouse jobs through automation. In the aftermath of the contract’s passage, the company has been cutting full-time positions, including buyouts of 200 air freight pilots, and canceling out modest wage increases by eliminating local Market Rate Adjustments.

TDU has played a critical role as the de facto public relations arm of the new union administration of Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien, a fact which O’Brien himself has acknowledged. TDU has presented him as a militant reformer, when in reality he was a long-standing hatchet man for previous President James Hoffa, even being briefly suspended in 2013 for threatening TDU campaigners. But they buried the hatchet with O’Brien and endorsed him in the union’s 2021 leadership election, where he won on the basis of the lowest turnout in the history of direct elections at the Teamsters.

Teamsters General President Sean O'Brien at the 2023 TDU Convention

By upholding the authority of the union bureaucracy, TDU and groups like it are playing a central role in maintaining the stability not just of the apparatus but of the corporate-controlled political system, which relies upon the bureaucracy to contain the explosive growth of working class opposition. This opposition has found organized expression in the growth of rank-and-file committees at UPS and in workplaces all over the world. O’Brien is a regular visitor to the Biden White House. He played a key role in buying Congress time last year to ban a strike on the railroads, after a Biden-sponsored contract was rejected by the workers.

The United Auto Workers, where new President Shawn Fain is supported by a TDU-like “reform” group United All Workers for Democracy (UAWD), is following the playbook set by the Teamsters at UPS. Fain is attempting to ram through contracts at the major automakers using a combination of threats, lies and likely outright fraud. Last week, Fain appeared at a joint rally with President Biden, which saw large counter-demonstrations over Biden’s support for Israel’s genocide in Gaza, to promote the auto contracts in front of a banner which instructed autoworkers to go “back to work.”

It is a measure of TDU’s integration into the highest levels of the union bureaucracy that both O’Brien and Fain were honored guests at the convention. Also making an appearance was Lindsay Dougherty, head of the Teamsters’ Motion Picture and Theatrical Trade Division. Her demagogic and vulgar tirades masked the union’s deliberate isolation of Teamster members from the writers’ and actors’ strikes. A pledge not to cross picket lines contained loopholes big enough to drive trucks through.

TDU’s rising stature has been financially remunerative. Ken Paff, a co-founder of the group in the late 1970s and formerly its national organizer, reportedly took expensive vacations this year snorkeling in the Caribbean and on safari in Tanzania. The Teamsters union has also poured more money into the organization itself than ever.

But its “success” in rising to the top of the apparatus has severely undermined its credibility in the working class. Its endorsement of O’Brien, prepared all the way back in 2018, produced a wave of revulsion among many of its own members, who left the organization in droves. The TDU is now identified among UPS workers with the new hated contract, as well as the undemocratic methods used to pass it.

In 2013, for example, the TDU attacked the administration of then-President James Hoffa for its diversion of funding from pensions to healthcare for full-timers, effectively freezing pension contributions. But this is exactly what the new UPS contract does, which TDU campaigned for. “It is mind-boggling to see how low Ken Paff, David Levin and TDU have sunk,” one worker remarked on social media.

TDU itself has been remarkably silent about the content of the convention. There were no public sessions, livestreams or videos available of the convention itself, and there was not even any reporting on the convention on TDU’s own website and social media outside of photo galleries. Reportedly for the first time, registration in the final period before the convention was limited to phone only, with the online option removed, apparently in order to better vet those in attendance.

Sources who spoke to the WSWS described a crisis atmosphere within the convention, as the organization moved forcefully to silence internal dissent. Teamsters Mobilize, a group which had campaigned for a rejection of the UPS contract, sent delegates to the convention. TDU initially reportedly considered banning all Teamsters Mobilize members and all others who campaigned for a “no” vote at UPS from attending but ended up barring “only” two of its leading members.

The most revealing episode came when a Teamsters Mobilize member rose to propose a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. That statement, which was republished on the group’s website, read in part:

“Many of these bombs, and other weapons that Israel is using, have been supplied by the U.S. government. The United States government is and has been the biggest economic, political, and military supporter of Israel since its founding in 1948, and has sent over $225 billion to Israel since 1951. Today, the United States funds 16% of Israel’s defense budget.

“And now, the Biden administration is proposing giving another $14.3 billion to Israel to fund the continued war on Gaza, much of which will be taken from our paychecks in taxes.

“[W]e have a duty to stand for the working people internationally and stand in opposition to attacks waged against them,” the statement added. It concluded, “As Teamsters members, we call on IBT General President Sean O’Brien to 1) oppose the Biden administration’s proposal to send billions of dollars in military aid to Israel, and 2) call on the U.S. government to immediately issue a call for a ceasefire and condemn Israel’s bombing and ground invasion in Gaza.”

Notwithstanding the WSWS’s differences with Teamsters Mobilize, the decision to put forward the resolution was entirely to their credit. But it provoked a furious response from the floor. In the end, the proposal was tabled and never even voted on.

By tabling the motion, TDU has shamefully aligned itself with genocide and with imperialist war, which is being paid for with trillions of dollars being wrung out of workers through job losses, wage cuts and rampant exploitation. They are taking their line from the American union bureaucracy as a whole, which has spent decades supporting war and regime change operations by Washington all over the world.

It also makes clear that TDU will do nothing to defend Teamster members who are being retaliated against for public support of the Palestinians. Among workers, there is growing support for industrial action to halt the manufacture and shipment of weapons. Given the central role of Teamsters members in US and world supply chains, any action taken by them would be crucial in cutting off supplies for the Gazan genocide, which would also almost certainly spread rapidly to other sections of the working class.

But TDU, having helped block a strike at UPS for higher wages and better working conditions, now opposes industrial action against genocide and war. In fact, they are two sides of the same coin, since the same corporate interests which were bailed out by the last-minute contract at UPS also stand to gain from a war whose aim, from Washington’s point of view, is the domination of the Middle East.

As if to drive home the connection between the two, TDU also tabled a resolution proposed by the same Teamsters Mobilize member calling for open bargaining and an end to negotiations under non-disclosure agreements. In other words, TDU supported the Teamsters’ ability to continue holding contract talks behind workers’ backs.

The TDU’s convention underscores that it is not a rank-and-file organization but a faction of the union bureaucracy, fearful of and distant from the workers.

The decades-long trajectory of TDU, from a reform caucus which often had to deal with physical violence from union officials, into a vital component of the bureaucracy itself, exposes the dead-end perspective of bureaucratic “self-reform.” Workers cannot settle accounts with the apparatus by replacing “bad” officials with “good” ones. They have to overturn the entire structure and abolish the bureaucracy as such. Only on this basis can workers return control to where it belongs, the rank and file itself.",Q4

NATCHITOCHES, La. — On Tuesday night, three band members of Southern University's Human Jukebox Marching Band were killed in a crash involving an 18-wheeler in Northern Louisiana.

Louisiana State Police say the crash, which happened shortly after 7 p.m. on Interstate 49 north of Natchitoches, claimed the lives of 19-year-old Tyran Williams of Dallas, 21-year-old Dylan Young of Dallas, and 19-year-old Broderick Moore of Cedar Hill, Texas.

Southern University and A&M College in Baton Rouge confirmed that all three men were students and members of the university's Human Jukebox Marching Band.

Troopers say the three men were trying to change a flat tire on their 1999 Jeep Laredo that was stalled on the northbound shoulder when an 18-wheeler drifted onto the shoulder and struck the Jeep. All three men were hit in the crash and suffered fatal injuries. They were pronounced dead at the scene.

The driver of the truck, identified as 62-year-old Clyde Gay, was wearing a seatbelt and was not injured in the crash. LSP said toxicology results are still pending and the crash remains under investigation.

WBRZ-TV in Baton Rouge reports the students were traveling to Texas for Christmas break. The station reports that one of the students was on the phone at the time of the crash, and a person on the other end of the call contacted the police.

Dennis J. Shields, President-Chancellor of Southern University released the following statement to the university community:

Dear Southern University Community,

It is with a heavy heart that I share the news of the tragic deaths of three of our students who reportedly succumbed to injuries in a vehicular accident on Tuesday evening in Natchitoches Parish.

Once the infrastructure could be examined in the daylight, it was determined that the damage was much more extensive than first thought, and local news reports said sources within the county’s emergency management office believed power could be out through Thursday.

Tens of thousands were without power in the county after what authorities say was an act of criminal vandalism at multiple substations. pic.twitter.com/Rsgl6VvaXB — いぶき (@ibuki53010508) December 4, 2022

This estimate was confirmed during a Sunday afternoon news conference, at which officials also announced that a State of Emergency had been declared for the county and that investigators from the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are working with Moore County to find the perpetrators. Sheriff Ronnie Fields said he’s also in contact with the US Attorney’s office and that the perpetrators will likely face federal charges.

Sheriff Ronnie Fields said that shortly after 7 PM Saturday night power outages started near Carthage, in the northeastern portion of the county, and:

Upon the arrival of the power crews and our deputies, extensive damage was found at their substations. Evidence at the scene indicated that the — showed that a firearm had been used to disable the equipment. Our deputies, along with all municipalities, police officers, state SBI, different ones come out and assisted us throughout the night to provide security at all of our substations.

The county announced that as part of the State of Emergency, shelters are open throughout the county for those who need it. Schools are closed for the next few days, both private and public, because of the power situation, and a curfew is in place from 9 PM to 5 AM.

Two of the substations affected by the attacks are part of Duke Energy’s power grid, and that damage was explained by Duke Energy’s Jeff Brooks:

As you heard from the Sheriff, last night between 7 and 8 PM one of our substations went offline. It was followed shortly thereafter by another substation. During our investigation of the outage, we did determine that there had been intentional impact on the substation, damaging multiple pieces of equipment in the substation and causing power to go out there. Unlike perhaps a a storm where you can go in and reroute power somewhere else, that was not an option in this case. So repair has to be completed. In many cases, some of that equipment will have to be replaced, and our crews are currently working on the repair plan. We’re pursuing multiple paths of restoration so that we can restore as many customers as possible, as quickly as possible. Recognizing that, we are looking at a pretty sophisticated repair with some fairly large equipment, and so we do want citizens of the town to be prepared that this will be a multi-day restoration for most customers, extending potentially as long as Thursday.

According to WRAL:

A Duke Energy outage map Saturday evening showed 37,998 customers without power in Moore County; The Randolph Electric Membership Corporation also reported nearly 3,000 customers without power in the southern part of the county. As of Sunday at 3 p.m. 44,657 people are without power, according to a Duke Energy outage map.

In addition to the two Duke Energy substations, a transmission substation operated by Randolph Electric Membership Corporation was heavily damaged. A system planning engineer with REMC told a reporter with Southern Pines local newspaper The Pilot that the perpetrators were familiar with how the stations were all connected to each other:

Folks, this was a terrible act… and the perpetrator will be brought to justice and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

McGinnis also asked people who don’t have business in Moore County over the next few days to stay out of the county, since there are no traffic signals operable.

In addition to electrical power, other infrastructure such as water and sewer could be affected, but are operating on backup generator power currently according to The Pilot.

As we reported Saturday night, Charlotte Clymer and other leftists are claiming that the attack was committed by “right wingers” who were opposed to a planned drag show at a Southern Pines theater. Sheriff Fields was asked whether officials were considering that angle and whether there was any evidence supporting that theory. Fields replied that his office and state and federal investigators are “working on every available angle” but that there was no evidence at this time to support that theory or any other motivation for the attack.

The county is home to thousands of soldiers stationed at Fort Bragg, home to the US Army Special Operations Command, portions of which are in the county.

A sick dad who was thrown in jail for marrying his daughter and making her sister compete for sex with him said his life is ""amazing"" now he has been released from prison.

Travis Fieldgrove spent two years behind bars after he entered into a sexual relationship with biological daughter Samantha Kershner in 2018, just three years after meeting her for the first time when she was 17.

‌



While locked up last November he declared that he ""couldn't wait to go home"" and was counting down the days until he was released from prison, which happened earlier this year.

At the time he posted to Facebook: ""Good morning ya'll I know one thing I cant wait to go home I got one month &16 days left cant wait but being in prison again made me realize something this time & that's lifes too short & I'm tired of wasting my life.""

‌

A year on from his post he seems to be making the most of his freedom and shares regular updates about his new life on Facebook.

One of his posts read: “One thing I realized that my past I wasn't the man I wanted to be when I went to prison then I took classes I didn't have to take just to pass by the time but they actually help me in the long run.

‌



""I learned for the first time and it help me realise deep down under the hood man is under all that garbage so I dug and dug for days while I was locked up and it change my life and my life now is amazing.”

Fieldgrove said his 'life now is amazing' after a two-year stint in jail (Image: Facebook )

In another, he brazenly declared that he wished he had gone to prison ""a long time ago"" while advised his Facebook friends to ""just get along"" to avoid his fate.

‌



He wrote: ""I wish I would've went to prison a long time ago. My best advice is love one another and just get along cause being locked up ain't a good life.""

Fieldgrove was jailed in 2019 for his incestuous relationship, which Kershner told police ""stemmed from a jealous competition with her half-sister regarding who could have sex with their father,"" court documents revealed at the time.

Fieldgrove now posts regularly to Facebook about his life after prison

‌



They began their dalliance after meeting for the first time and initially developing a normal father-daughter relationship before embarking on what investigators called “a sordid sexual affair.”

The pair even went on to get married illegally and announced their nuptials on Facebook despite knowing they were under investigation.

They were later arrested for incest after Kershner raised the alarm to police about their affair, with the young woman also receiving a 22-day sentence and Fieldgrove banned from contacting his daughter upon his release.

Police said at the time: ""This case relates to the two being involved in an intimate relationship beginning in September of 2018 in Grand Island, Nebraska, despite evidence that Fieldgrove is the paternal parent.

""Evidence leading up to the arrest suggests that Fieldgrove and Kershner were aware of the biological relationship before being intimate.""

Marion and Polk counties, Aumsville, Dallas, Gates, Hubbard, Independence, Jefferson, Keizer, Lyons, Mill City, Sublimity, St. Paul, Stayton, Turner, Willamina and Woodburn all were voting to ban the substance in their cities, many by wide margins in the initial results.

The measures in Marion and Polk counties would cover unincorporated parts of their counties, but not in city limits.

The bans in Gates, Hubbard and Jefferson are temporary and would sunset in 2024. The others would be permanent.

If voters choose to ban the psychedelic substance, which is found in certain strains of mushrooms, it would prohibit “service centers,” where people would receive the substance, as well as the commercial growing of the mushrooms.

Voters in Oregon opted to legalize the use of psilocybin in clinical settings under Measure 109 in the 2020 election. But cities and counties were given the ability to ask voters to opt out.

Other ballot measures in local cities

Detroit city charter

Detroit residents were narrowly voting down a new charter for the city, according to early returns.

The new charter would change residency requirements, remove gender-exclusive references and make other changes, including correcting misspellings and formatting.

Currently, the charter limits the number of non-primary residents on the seven-member council to two.

The city was hard hit in the 2020 wildfires. About 80% of the homes in the town burned down and all of its residents were displaced at one time.

Keizer library fee

Voters were rejecting a measure to impose a fee for a public library.

The city asked residents to approve a $2.50 per month fee for each home and apartment to pay for a public library. The current library, which has existed since 1988, is a non-profit and doesn’t receive public funds.

Keizer is the only city in the state larger than 3,500 people without a public library.

Aumsville marijuana

Voters were voting down a measure that would allow marijuana businesses in the city, but were strongly supporting a measure to allow the city to tax retailers for marijuana sales.

In 2016, Aumsville voters opted to prohibit marijuana dispensaries.

If the first measure is passed, dispensaries, retailers, processors and wholesalers would be allowed to operate in Aumsville.

The second measure would allow the city to tax retailers for each marijuana sale, provided the first measure passes.

Silverton pool levy

Voters in Silverton were overwhelmingly supporting an operations levy for the city’s pool.

The tax would cost homeowners 28 cents per $1,000 of assessed value.

The current levy was last passed in 2017 and expires June 30. That levy cost residents 45 cents per $1,000 of assessed value of their homes.

Falls City operation levy

Falls City residents were narrowly passing a $1 per $1,000 of assessed value, five-year levy that would fund emergency equipment.

The levy, which would start July 1, would go to update emergency equipment. It would raise approximately $256,179 over five years.

An organization representing journalists worldwide said 68 journalists had been killed covering the Israel-Hamas war.

A leading organization representing journalists worldwide expressed deep concern Friday at the number of media professionals killed around the globe doing their jobs in 2023, with Israel’s war against Hamas claiming more journalists than any conflict in more than 30 years.

In its annual count of media worker deaths, the International Federation of Journalists said 94 journalists had been killed so far this year and almost 400 others had been imprisoned.

The group called for better protection for media workers and for their attackers to be held to account.

“The imperative for a new global standard for the protection of journalists and effective international enforcement has never been greater,” IFJ President Dominique Pradalié said.

The group said 68 journalists had been killed covering the Israel-Hamas war since the militant group attacked Israel on Oct. 7 — more than one a day and 72% of all media deaths worldwide. It said the overwhelming majority of them were Palestinian journalists in the Gaza Strip, where Israeli forces continue their air bombardment and ground attacks.

“The war in Gaza has been more deadly for journalists than any single conflict since the IFJ began recording journalists killed in the line of duty in 1990,” the group said, adding that deaths have come at “a scale and pace of loss of media professionals’ lives without precedent.”

Ukraine also “remains a dangerous country for journalists” almost two years after Russia’s invasion, the organization said. It said three reporters and media workers had been killed in that war so far this year.

The organization also deplored media deaths in Afghanistan, the Philippines, India, China and Bangladesh.

It expressed concern that crimes against media workers are going unpunished and urged governments “to shed full light on these murders and to put in place measures to ensure the safety of journalists.”

It noted a drop in the number of journalists killed in North and South America, from 29 last year to seven so far in 2023. The group said the three Mexicans, one Paraguayan, one Guatemalan, one Colombian and one American were slain while investigating armed groups or the embezzlement of public funds.

Africa remained the region least affected by deaths of journalists, but the organization highlighted what it described as “three particularly shocking murders” in Cameroon and Lesotho that it said have yet to be fully investigated.

In all, 393 media workers were being held in prison so far this year, the group said. The biggest number were jailed in China and Hong Kong — 80 journalists — followed by 54 in Myanmar, 41 in Turkey, 40 in Russia and occupied Crimea in Ukraine, 35 in Belarus and 23 in Egypt.

COLUMBUS, Ohio — In early November, Columbus Public Health announced four measles cases linked to a Columbus area childcare facility. According to CPH, all of the patients were old enough to receive at least one dose of the MMR vaccine, but did not get it.

Now one month later, there have been 74 confirmed cases and 26 hospitalizations. Most of the patients are under the age of 5.

Health leaders say vaccination rates weren’t where they should be before the pandemic and the pandemic, combined with misinformation, may have made the problem worse.

Dr. Nora Colburn is an Assistant Professor of Clinical Medicine at OSU Wexner Medical Center. She is also the Medical Director of Clinical Epidemiology for the Ross Heart Hospital. She said she believes her role as a medical provider has evolved to now also include a responsibility of combating misinformation. She has been focused on efforts to share the facts about the MMR vaccine.

""I talked about vaccines with almost every single patient encounter, and I have encountered many patients who are hesitant about vaccines for a variety of reasons,” she explained. “So the way that I approach it, I really try to meet them where they are and understand and ask open-ended questions of what are your concerns about the vaccine? And is there any questions that I can answer?""

Education is something Dr. Mysheika Roberts, the Columbus Public Health Commissioner, is leading the charge on.

""To make sure we get all the right information out into the hands of the population that needs it the most,” she said.

Her department is also focused on making sure everyone has access to the vaccines they need.

“Our measles, mumps and rubella vaccination rates weren't great before the pandemic,” Dr. Roberts said. “Even after the pandemic, we know that access to care has been limited. For some people, some people have been reluctant to go into health care facilities or go inside in general.""

Now that there is an outbreak she is also making sure people know the symptoms to watch for.

“Because some people have not seen measles because we've done such a great job with our vaccine program here in this country. So we want to make sure we provide that education to providers as well.”",Q4
https://cimsec.org/brief-history-austro-hungarian-navy/,A Brief History of the Austro-Hungarian Navy,"By Jason Lancaster

Most people would not think of modern land-locked, mountainous Austria as a maritime power, and many of those that have heard of the Austrian Navy wonder why the Nazis wanted an Austrian U-boat captain in the Sound of Music. From 1797 until 1918, the Kaiserlich und Königlich (K.u.K.) Austro-Hungarian Navy fought naval battles against the Danes, French, Italians, and British on European seas, and deployed as far as the South China Sea.

Geographically, Austria was a land power, with little maritime trade and many continental enemies. Following Napoleon’s victories in Italy, the Austrian Empire and France signed the Treaty of Campoformio in 1797. France received Belgium, Lombardy, and territory along the Rhine, while Austria received the Venetian Republic and their navy, a solid base to create a deterrent force.

However, caught in the maelstrom of the Napoleonic Wars, Austria did not have the finances to both fight Napoleon and build a powerful navy. Thus the navy played a minor role in the Napoleonic Wars, and in those early days Austria had little idea of naval strategy. The Austrian Navy’s fortunes ebbed and flowed as Napoleon’s forces marched too and fro across the European continent.

Following Napoleon’s abdication in 1814, Austria inherited the former fleet of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, comprised of several newly built ships of the line and frigates, as well as the officers and crews of the vessels.1 It took Austria a long time to learn the advantages of sea power, and by the time she did, she had already lost Venice and its attendant dockyards to the newly unified Italy.

Austria’s ignorance of sea power’s benefits prevented her from expanding foreign trade, and caused her great diplomatic embarrassment during the early 19th century. In 1817, Austria sent a merchant ship to Canton, China, flying the new red and white ensign (the present Austrian National flag). However, the ship was refused entrance because the flag was not recognized by the Chinese.

During the Franco-Austrian War of 1859, the French fleet sailed into the Adriatic and dominated the sea. The Austrian fleet withdrew into their fortified harbors. The Adriatic Sea should have been an Austrian lake, but she lacked the strength to defend it in the face of the larger and more powerful French Navy. A notable incident from this humiliating affair was the return of the Austrian frigate Novarra, from a research-motivated circumnavigation of the globe. Napoleon III declared her a neutral vessel, “Because she was carrying the scientific treasures of value to the whole world.”2

In 1860, the Sardinian Prime Minister, Prince Cavour, sent the Sardinian fleet to blockade Ancona and support Garibaldi’s attacks on the Italian Marches. This caused a terrible fright along the Dalmatian coast, because of irredentist Italian claims to the region. The fears only ceased when Britain declared she would not recognize Italian claims to Dalmatia and Istria.3 This humiliation, in conjunction with Italian naval construction, drove the Austrians to rebuild their navy.

In 1854, a railroad from Vienna to Trieste was completed, which spurred regional commercial activity and rejuvenated foreign trade. Maritime activity fueled the creation of jobs and economic well-being, while naval construction spurred the economies of Istria and Trieste and gave rise to popularity in the Parliament. Advances in technology had rendered the previous generation of Nelsonian ships of the line obsolete; steam, armor, and the screw propeller, among other technologies, gave smaller ships a fighting chance against great ships of the line and allowed lesser powers to catch up and rapidly achieve a sort of parity with great naval powers.

Even without an indigenous shipbuilding industry, Italy had become the third largest naval power in the world. All of her ships came from British and American yards.4 Ferdinand Max, brother of Franz Josef, and Commander in Chief of the Austrian Navy, argued for increased construction and capabilities because, “a well-ordered propeller squadron only a few hours from Corfu or the Italian coast would make Austria a more attractive ally to Britain or France.” Throughout this period, Ferdinand Max fought for every florin possible in the budget for construction of a capable, modern Austrian Navy. At the end of 1860, he ordered two screw-propeller frigates constructed at Trieste. 5

Archduke Ferdinand’s new navy fought the last fleet action with wooden ships in the Second Schleswig War against Denmark in 1864. Simply getting to the North Sea was a victory in itself. Captain Wilhelm von Tegetthoff sailed his squadron for Lisbon, Brest, and the Downs. The British were not fond of having foreign navies so close to home, and they looked unfavorably on the Austro-German attack on Denmark. “British public opinion was aroused to the point that talk of war with Austria was common. The British Channel Fleet was ordered to the Downs, and a training squadron recalled from Portugal.”6 When Lord John Russell learned of the Austrian deployment, he threatened to send a British squadron to the Adriatic. The government in Vienna called his bluff, but the British attitude to the war would cause Habsburg headaches.

Tegetthoff’s squadron was supposed to break the Danish blockade of Hamburg. On May 4, 1864, Tegetthoff’s squadron encountered a superior Danish squadron off Helgoland. They fought until the Schwarzenburg, Tegetthoff’s flagship, was on fire and compelled to withdraw. Once the flames were extinguished, Tegetthoff returned to find the Danish (who had also suffered heavy damage) gone. Although, tactically a draw, the Danish did not renew their blockade of Hamburg, allowing Austria to claim victory. After the war with Denmark ended, Austrian Foreign Minister Mennsdorf-Pouilly signed an agreement with General von Roon which agreed to let the armaments factory Krupp sell naval artillery to the Austrians, although Prussia declined to purchase any Austrian built ships.7

Despite agreements to purchase Prussian naval artillery, Austro-Prussian military cooperation was short lived; Austria’s next war would pit her against Italy and Prussia, her erstwhile ally. On July 3, 1866, Prussia utterly defeated the Austrians in the north at Königgrätz, but in the south Austria was victorious on land and sea.

One week earlier, the Austrian army had routed the Italian army at Custoza. At sea, the Austrian Navy defeated an Italian invasion fleet at the battle of Lissa on July 20, 1866. Lissa was the first major armored fleet action in history. A superior Italian fleet was beaten and forced to withdrawal from the Dalmatian coast. According to estimates by John Hale, in Famous Sea Fights, “taking into account the number and weight of rifled artillery on ironclads, the Austrians had 1,776 pounds of shell to the Italians 20,392 pounds.” The victory over the Italian fleet was telling; the Italians lost 612 officers and men, along with two ironclads, while the Austrians lost 38 officers and men, two of whom were captains. In his book The Imperial and Royal Austro-Hungarian Navy, Dr. Sokol argues that, “in their excitement, the Italians often failed to load their guns before firing them,” which might account for the slight number of casualties suffered by the Austrians.

Emperor Maximilian of Mexico, formerly Ferdinand Max, Commander in Chief of the Austrian Navy, sent his congratulations to now Admiral Tegetthoff. “The glorious victory which you have gained over a brave enemy, vastly superior in numbers and nurtured in grand old naval traditions, has filled my heart with unmixed joy. With the victory of Lissa your fleet becomes enrolled amongst those whose flag is the symbol of glory, and your name is added to the list of naval heroes of all time.”

Lissa was not only the first major ironclad fleet action, but the sinking of the Re D’Italia by Tegetthoff’s flagship the Erzherzog Ferdinand Max by ramming brought that weapon back into vogue among naval architects and tacticians. It was not until the Spanish-American War almost thirty years later, that the ram would again lose favor. Despite the Austro-Prussian-Italian War having the first ironclad fleet battle, there was a lack of naval warfare through most of the conflict. Theorists studied Lissa, but the rest of the naval war neglected commerce raiding and blockades. Dr. Sokol asserts that is because both navies “thought of naval warfare chiefly as guarding their own coasts.” 8

Admiral Tegetthoff threw a party aboard his flagship for his captains after the battle of Lissa and charged the expenses to the navy budget. Later, the Ministry of Finance “deducted a sum from his salary each month, until he had paid off the cost.” Heroes and celebrities the iron men might have been, but bureaucratic infighting was not going to be easier, simply because they had defeated the Italians in a war that was already lost.9

Over time, the Austrian government learned to wield their increasingly effective navy. By the time of the Great War, Austria managed to hold her own against a combined Franco-Italian fleet. Between August 1914 and February 1917, Austria sank three Italian battleships, two Italian cruisers and a French cruiser, at the cost of one cruiser, an exchange of 85,000 tons for 2,300.10

While the bulk of the Mediterranean submarine patrols were performed by the German Navy (because their submarines were bigger and had more endurance), the Germans had loaned three of their larger submarines to the Austrian Navy.11 The Austrian submarine force was so effective in the Adriatic that the British Royal Navy was forced to support the rest of the Entente powers in their anti-submarine barrier patrols and mine fields across the mouth of the Adriatic Sea called the “Otranto Barrage.” Unlike the Royal Navy that had minimized their planning for submarines during war, Austria had integrated submarines into her naval war plans from the start; these submarines preyed on Entente shipping in the Adriatic and Mediterranean.

Austria was also a pioneer of naval aviation. Austria was the first nation to develop naval aviation in 1913. Early adoption of this capability allowed Austria to control the skies over the Adriatic for the bulk of the war. At the start of the war Austria had 22 seaplanes, and by the time Italy entered the war, Austria had 47 seaplanes. These planes were used for scouting enemy fleet movements as well as attacks on naval bases and vessels at sea.12

Despite the early success of the Austrian Navy, Austria and her allies ultimately lost that war. The Austro-Hungarian Empire was dismembered and new nations based on nationality arose. In Hungary, Admiral Horthy rose to prominent political office during the post-war years, becoming a right wing dictator who was later assassinated by the Nazis. After the fall of the empire, Austria retained the naval ensign as her own national flag, a subtle reminder of a glorious past. Today, the old red and white Austrian ensign flies over Schönbrunn and the Hofburg.

The RPO, DPO Shafiullah Gandapur and other police officers addressed a press conference in Swat Press Club.

Mr Sajjad said the incident was not linked to terrorist activity, but was a clash between two persons over an illicit relationship with a woman.

He said that Mr Qayyum was murdered on Dec 14 near his house in the Asharbanr area of Charbagh tehsil by unidentified persons.

“The case was assigned to Upper Swat SP Khankhel Khan, who formed a team comprising DSP Charbagh circle Habibullah Khan, DSP Khwazakhela circle Ejaz Khan, SHO Akbar Hussain and investigation officer Ayaz Khan,” he said, adding the investigation team also collected data from the cell phones of the deceased.

The RPO said in the light of ground and digital evidence the team reached the accused and arrested three persons, including a woman.

“The arrested suspects include Mohammad Salim, Farman Ali and a married woman, all residents of Asharbanr,” he said.

The RPO said that the investigators found that Qayyum had an illicit relationship with the woman and had bought a mobile SIM for her and asked her to talk to him through this number only.

Mr Sajjad said when the woman’s former lover, Salim, learnt about her relationship with Qayyum he threatened her to cease contacts with him. He said the woman blocked the SIM due to fear. He said that later differences developed between Qayyum and Salim.

The RPO said Salim and his friend Farman killed Qayyum with the consultation of the woman. He said the police had registered an FIR under section 302 against the accused.

A Mountain View Police Department investigative report revealed details about the circumstances that led to the June 18 homicide case at a Shoreline Amphitheatre Chris Stapleton concert, in which a man died after he was allegedly punched once in the back of the head by a Hells Angels Motorcycle Club member. The victim suffered a traumatic brain injury, was put on life support and died a week and a half later.

Four of the five defendants identified as suspects in the case posted bail and are out of custody, according to the District Attorney’s office. Logan Winterton, the only suspect charged with murder, remains in custody.

In a separate incident earlier that night, an off-duty police officer was “brutally assaulted by a group of men near a collection of portable restrooms before they walked away from the area,” police said in a Nov. 15 statement. As officers began investigating the incidents, they found that the suspects involved with both incidents knew one another and were associated with the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club.

Off-duty police officer beaten

According to an investigative report prepared by Mountain View Police Department Detective Jason Roldan, the first incident on June 18 began as suspects David Wiesenhaven and Raymond Cunanan were waiting in line to use a portable restroom. The first victim of the night, the off-duty police officer, was also waiting in line. According to the report, video surveillance shows the victim approaching Cunanan and standing beside him.

After what appeared to be a brief conversation, the report said, Cunanan put his drink down while the victim remained standing in place. Cunanan then put both hands around the victim’s neck and forcefully pushed him backward, out of the camera’s view.

A short while later, the victim came back into camera range and walked unsteadily, the report said. Winterton and Wiesenhaven approached the victim and one of them threw a beverage on him. One of them punched him in the face and caused him to fall, but the report said it’s unclear who punched him due to the camera angle. While the victim was on the ground, Winterton, Wiesenhaven, Cunanan and Julio Moran kicked and punched him, the report said. After the assault, the four suspects left the scene together.

According to the report, medical personnel responded to the scene at around 9:50 p.m. The officer was transported by ambulance to Stanford Hospital and treated for a broken orbital bone, discoloration to his eyes, loss of consciousness and significant facial swelling.

Fatal punch to the head

Later that night around 10:40 p.m., several Hells Angels members and associates were congregating in the Stage Right Cafe area of the amphitheater, a group that included suspects Winterton, Dominic Guardado, Wiesenhaven, Cunanan and Moran, the report states.

Juan Gonzalez, 41, walked through the group.

Winterton “looked and waved his hands in the direction” of the victim, the report said. Shortly after, the victim returned to the group and walked toward Zoe McGaughran, identified as Guardado’s girlfriend.

Gonzalez touched McGaughran’s shoulder in front of several Hell’s Angels members, and then walked away, the report said. While the victim walked away, “Winterton paced back and forth waving his hands from side to side in the air” while looking at the victim, the report stated. Winterton rolled up his sleeves before separating from the group and walking toward the victim. He then faced the group and rubbed his fist against his open palm, the report states, before turning around and walking toward the victim. Guardado, Wiesenhaven and Cunanan followed him.

According to another person who was present, Gonzalez was punched in the back of the head one time and fell face forward into the concrete. The person was 4 to 5 feet away when Gonzalez was punched. The victim didn’t see the suspect coming or have time to break his fall, according to the witness, the report states. Winterton is the prime suspect in the murder of Gonzalez, police said.

Another individual who was present saw Gonzalez lying on the ground and being crowded by several men from Hells Angels. One of the perpetrators poured beer on Gonzalez and said, “This is what you get,” followed by an expletive, the report states.

According to the report, after the victim was punched to the ground, Guardado, wearing his Hells Angels vest, cornered the first witness against a food truck. He allegedly said, “You didn’t see nothing!”, the report states. According to the second witness, Guardado lifted the first witness by the collar. The witness said he feared for his safety because he believes the Hells Angels to be a violent organization, and the police are identifying this witness as a victim.

As Guardado, Cunanan, Winterton and McGaughran left the area, another individual followed after them and called concert security over the phone. Cunanan appeared to overhear the third witness because he turned around and blocked the witness’s path. Cunanan said, “You won’t want to go after this guy,” according to the report. The third witness, fearing for their safety, stopped following the group and ran to a nearby security office, the report said, and police are also treating that witness as a victim.

At 10:53 p.m., Gonzalez was treated on the scene and then transported to the Stanford Hospital Emergency Room, the report said. He suffered a traumatic brain injury and had no brain activity. He was removed from life support on June 29.

The Santa Clara County Coroner’s Office performed an autopsy and found the cause of death to be blunt force trauma to the head and the case is classified as a homicide.

Winterton, 37, a San Francisco resident was charged with murder and assault likely to produce great bodily injury, and he’s the prime suspect in Gonzalez’s death, according to police. Winterton remains in custody “on no-bail allowed as he is the sole individual charged with causing the death of one of the victims,” Deputy District Attorney Irene Williams told the Voice.

Guardado, 33, of San Francisco was arrested on charges of dissuading a witness to a crime, meaning he allegedly attempted to prevent someone from saying anything after the attack, police said. Cunanan, 42, a Pleasant Hill resident, was charged with both dissuading a witness and assault likely to produce great bodily injury. Wiesenhaven, 38, a San Francisco resident, was charged with assault likely to produce great bodily injury. Moran, 43, a San Mateo resident, was charged with assault likely to produce great bodily injury. These four defendants are out of custody after posting bail, Williams told the Voice.",Q4

Russell Henry Dandridge, 58, of Annapolis, was transported to an area hospital with life-threatening injuries after a 2001 Volvo S80 he was riding in crashed into a utility pole off Solomons Island Road at about 7:15 p.m., police said in a news release.

Investigators determined the Volvo was traveling southbound on Solomons Island Road approaching eastbound Route 665, and left the right side of the roadway before striking the pole, according to the release.

The driver, 53-year-old Lamar Rondell Williams, also of Annapolis, was arrested on a manslaughter charge after police determined he was under the influence, the release said.

Charging papers say Williams told officers he lost control of the car when the vehicles ahead of him had come to a stop and he hit the brakes. After Dandridge, who was riding in the front seat, was declared dead at about 8 that evening, police conducted field sobriety tests on Williams. He failed several of the tests, police said.

Witnesses to the crash told police they overheard Williams remark “that he had too much to drink” and he started to urinate on the side of the road, police said. After conducting breath testing, they found Williams had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.20. A 0.08 reading is the minimum for a DUI charge in Maryland, and a 0.07 for a DWI.

Williams did not complain of injuries at the scene of the crash, but asked to be evaluated during booking, according to a police department spokesperson. He was taken to an area hospital and later released.

Williams is being represented by the Office of the Public Defender. At a bail review Monday morning, Anne Arundel District Judge Thomas J. Pryal ordered Williams to be held on house arrest without bond.",Q4

Craig Crenshaw, the Virginia Secretary of Veterans and Defense Affairs—and a retired Marine Corps major general, to boot—was a special guest Thursday at the regular session of the Rappahannock Regional Veterans Treatment Docket. Held at Spotsylvania Circuit Court and presided over by Judge Ricardo Rigual, who also served in the Marines, the session marked the first time that Horton moved up in the program.

When his name was called, the 35-year-old stood in front of the judge, who praised him for all the good things he’d been hearing. Horton, who’d been charged with driving under the influence this spring, had been to the necessary meetings for treatment and support as part of the intensive program aimed to get nonviolent offers back on track.

Veteran court program grad shows 'a level of bravery that most people can't face' Rick Rein, a veteran of the Iraqi war, Bronze Star and three-time Purple Heart winner, worked to overcome combat trauma and subsequent addiction.

Horton had lost his driver’s license with the charge and Rigual told him Thursday that the paperwork had been completed for him to get a restricted license. Then, instead of simply handing him a certificate, the judge asked the special guest to do the courtroom equivalent of pinning stripes on Horton—or at least the way the Marines would do it.

Crenshaw cupped a special challenge coin in his palm, then shook hands with Horton and congratulated him. Crenshaw was on a tight schedule and had to scoot, but not before Rigual returned the favor and gave him a coin representing the veterans program.

Meanwhile, Horton and his mother, Rosie, both have some experience with the Army. She retired after 20 years and he served from 2009–12, including as gunner in Afghanistan, providing support to medical units.

Both were flabbergasted by Thursday’s events, and the attention Kenneth Horton received.

“I’m shocked, surprised and extremely happy about it,” he said. “I had no idea this was happening today.”

One by one, fellow program participants came over to congratulate Horton and wish him well. A program mentor waited for him outside the courtroom and told him to keep the momentum going.

“You got the whole world waiting for you,” Dexter Griffin told Horton. “Turn the page, take the step, don’t forget that.”

That’s exactly what Crenshaw said to the courtroom during his remarks. Anyone who’s been in uniform or “worn the cloth of our great nation,” feels the kindred spirit among fellow service members. The men and women who voluntarily serve as mentors, all fellow veterans, are as close as a phone call away, Crenshaw said.

“The mentors you have, the ones who sit there kneecap to kneecap and have those frank discussions with you, they have invested their time and their energy because they want to, because they want to be a part of your success,” he said. “So continue to do what you do, continue to recognize there’s a light at the end—and there are going to be challenging times through this journey—but you have a phone call you can make.”

Graduate of veterans court program 'is as tough as they come' Rachel Thornsberry plans to use her experience as a veteran and recovering drug addict to become a social worker and help others.

As head of Virginia Veterans and Defense Affairs, Crenshaw focuses on opportunities for veterans and servicemembers who are making the transition from the military. Crenshaw said he could stand there for days and recite all the opportunities available in the state, which has 700,000 veterans and their families.

Virginia also has the nation’s fastest-growing veteran population and the greatest number of veterans in the workforce per capita, according to Veterans and Defense Affairs.

Crenshaw encouraged the veterans to make Virginia the place they choose to work and raise their families after the military. While his department focuses on necessary resources, he said organizations like the local veterans docket, which provides substance abuse treatment, mental health services and rehabilitation, all under court supervision, also work to make a difference.

“This goes a long way to that point,” Crenshaw said.

The treatment docket covers Fredericksburg and the counties of King George, Spotsylvania and Stafford. The partnership includes representatives from the courts, the Spotsylvania Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office, Office of the Public Defender, the Rappahannock Area Community Services Board, the Rappahannock Regional Jail and the Veterans Administration.

The docket initially was set up for veterans facing nonviolent felony charges, and the program covered five phases that lasted about 18 months. The docket recently expanded to include a limited number of misdemeanor cases and veterans with those charges will be in the program over three phases and a minimum of 12 months.

Mentors are always needed, according to program officials. Those interested can contact Ann Baker at abaker@rrj.state.va.us.",Q4

https://www.duboiscountyfreepress.com/lukemeyer-seeking-election-to-greater-jasper-school-board-district-3/,Lukemeyer seeking election to Greater Jasper School Board District 3,"Steve Lukemeyer is on the ballot for the District 3 seat on the Greater Jasper Consolidated School Board.

Lukemeyer’s decision to seek the office is based on several factors.

“First and foremost, I have four school-age children – a junior, freshman, seventh grader, and fifth grader,” he explained. “Needless to say, I have a very vested interest in the quality of our school system. I know what kids face every day in school. Their feedback helps me understand the challenges they face and gives me a perspective that will help me make decisions that are in the best interests of the children.”

Additionally, Lukemeyer feels that it is time for a fresh perspective on the school board.

“I think that over time, change is healthy in elected positions. I think very highly of my opponent, and I appreciate what he has done for the school corporation,” Lukemeyer said. “However, he has been on the school board for 24 years and has not had kids in the school system since he was originally elected in 1998. A lot has changed for students over that 24-year period, and I believe that it is necessary to bring a new perspective and a new analytical eye to our school board.”

He would like to hear from parents and have them become more involved in the school board meetings. Lukemeyer explained that a frustration he has had as a parent is the lack of notice regarding the school board meeting agendas. “We need to inform parents what is on the agenda for each monthly meeting so that they can attend and speak if they so desire,” he explained. “Currently, the only way a parent can find out what is on the agenda is to arrive at the meeting and pick up an agenda at the door. I have requested that each agenda be placed on the school corporation website in advance, but that request was declined. I will always welcome and encourage parents to attend school board meetings and share their opinions.”

Lukemeyer grew up in Jasper. He is a proud alumnus of Tenth Street Elementary, Jasper Middle School (when it was next to the Cabby O’Neil gym), and Jasper High School, Class of 1991. He attended Indiana University – Bloomington and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice before going to law school at Indiana University – Indianapolis, where he received a Doctorate of Jurisprudence in 1999. He passed the Indiana bar exam that same year. He lived in Indianapolis and practiced law there until 2009 when he and his wife, Anita (Wibbels), decided they wanted to give their children the incredible childhood they both enjoyed in their hometown of Jasper.

After moving back, Lukemeyer realized his true passion was real estate sales. Although he still maintains his license to practice law, he chose real estate brokerage as his full-time career.

Operating his own business for the past 12 years has given Lukemeyer experience in working with a budget and monitoring spending. He says he is fiscally conservative and will be a good steward of taxpayers’ money.

He added that the teachers, staff and administrators in the Greater Jasper School Corporation are exceptional. “I have had the opportunity recently to have detailed conversations with administrators at the elementary schools, middle school, high school, and superintendent’s office,” he said. “All of them are incredibly dialed in on the needs and wants within their areas. It is important to me that I do my part in continuing to provide the support they need from the school board and hopefully help find a way to accomplish some of their ‘wants’ that will further improve the already phenomenal school system we have.”

He strongly believes education creates opportunities for all children and that the school board’s actions and decisions must always be laser-focused on the best interests of the students. Our schools need to be a safe haven for young people to tune out the noise of the world around them and be in an environment that is bountiful with opportunities to learn, to be challenged, to interact with each other, and to prepare themselves to be successful in life, he said.

Lukemeyer has served on the Board of Directors of the Jasper Chamber of Commerce, the Habitat for Humanity of Dubois County Board of Directors, the Holy Trinity Catholic School – School Council, and the Precious Blood Church Outreach Committee. He also participated in the Jasper High School Community Action Team, which was a group of local business people who met with the principal regularly to engage in discussions about a wide variety of school topics. He has also been a financial supporter of Junior Achievement and the Jasper Public Library Summer Reading Program for as long as he can remember.

Lukemeyer and his family are members of the Precious Blood Catholic Church. He and his wife have four children; Noah (16), Nate (15), Abby (12) and Ashley (11).",Q4

The 20-month-old boy was originally reported missing on the morning of Oct. 5 by his mother, 22-year-old Leilani Simon, who has since been arrested and charged with malice murder, concealing the death of another person, and other charges.

The little boy's remains were found on Nov. 18 following a 30-day search through the Superior Landfill, a process that authorities called ""more grueling than anyone could have imagined.""

https://www.foxnews.com/us/virginia-students-certain-schools-could-be-required-wear-masks-despite-gov-glenn-younkins-mandate-ban,Virginia students in certain schools could be required to wear masks despite Gov. Glenn Younkin's mandate ban,"Disabled students can request that their peers be required to wear masks in class in 12 Virginia schools after a group of parents filed and won a lawsuit challenging Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin’s executive order that ended the statewide school mask mandate in favor of parents choosing to mask or not to mask their children.

Parents at 12 schools filed a lawsuit in February to challenge an executive order from Gov. Glenn Youngkin as well as a new state law giving parents the right to exempt their children from mask mandates that were in place at schools at the time.

The parents who sued said that under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, requiring masks is a ""reasonable accommodation"" for students at high risk of complications from COVID-19.

In a ruling on Wednesday, the Commonwealth affirmed that students wearing masks is a ""reasonable accommodation"" to protect a child with disabilities, as part of a settlement in the Seaman et al. vs. Commonwealth of Virginia et al. lawsuit.

The settlement clarifies that parents of disabled children can request that the students' peers be required to wear masks.

NEARLY 3,000 PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY DIED FROM THE FLU THIS SEASON: CDC

The school district then is required to engage in an ""interactive process"" to determine whether peer masking is necessary. The settlement says schools can also consider alternatives solutions like social distancing, ventilation improvements, and teachers wearing masks.

""This pandemic has been hard on everyone. It’s been especially hard for medically complex children, children with disabilities, and those at high risk for COVID-19. This settlement is a step toward righting a wrong. Children like mine should not be told they cannot participate safely in school or that they have to be segregated. They have a right to the same education as every other child. As adults, it’s our responsibility to make sure that we include everyone in our decisions and come up with solutions that provide equity in school,"" Tasha Nelson, a plaintiff parent, said in a statement.

The complaint argues that Younkin's executive order violates disabled students’ right to access public education under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

""While Executive Order 2 makes it more difficult for schools and parents to protect the health and safety of all of Virginia’s children, it also leaves parents of many Virginia children with disabilities with an unconscionable choice: to choose between putting them at risk of severe illness if they contract COVID-19 and keeping them home with little or no education. For many of these children, Governor Youngkin has effectively barred the schoolhouse door,"" the complaint argues.

FAMILY OF ARMED VIRGINIA BEACH MAN KILLED BY POLICE SUES CITY, SEEKS MORE THAN $50M IN DAMAGES

The settlement goes into effect immediately and remains in effect as long as any of the plaintiff students attend a Virginia public school.

""We’re hopeful that every school in Virginia will view this settlement as a sign that they should make similar accommodations for their students, even if they are not part of the case,"" said Eden Heilman, the legal director of the ACLU of Virginia said in a statement.

The agreement will also require the Virginia Department of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction to send guidance to school districts and post their recommendations online on the state's COVID-19 Special Education Resources page.

If parents don't want their child to wear a mask, the settlement instructs schools to take reasonable steps to accommodate those parents as well, giving examples of rearranging classroom seating or changing class assignments.

The students whose families sued have health conditions including cancer, cystic fibrosis, asthma, Down syndrome, lung conditions and weakened immune systems.

In a written statement, Victoria LaCivita, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Jason Miyares, said, ""We were pleased to assist the governor in settling this case in a way that protects the federal rights of students with disabilities while ensuring that parents retain the state-law right to decide whether their children should wear a mask.""

The schools attended by the students when the suit was filed in February are Brownsville Elementary School in Albemarle County; Stanton River Middle in Bedford County; Grassfield Elementary and Southeastern Elementary in Chesapeake; Enon Elementary in Chesterfield County; Cumberland Elementary in Cumberland County; Stenwood Elementary in Fairfax County; Quioccasin Middle in Henrico County; Trailside Middle and Loudoun County High in Loudoun County; Jennie Dean Elementary in Manassas City; and Tabb Middle in York County.

https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/10/31/governor-newsom-taps-leading-experts-and-advocates-for-council-on-holocaust-and-genocide-education/,Governor Newsom Taps Leading Experts and Advocates for Council on Holocaust and Genocide Education,"SACRAMENTO – In the wake of a disturbing increase in antisemitic hate, Governor Gavin Newsom today named nine leading academic experts and advocates to serve on the Governor’s Council on Holocaust and Genocide Education, which is tasked with promoting Holocaust and genocide education throughout California to provide young people with the tools necessary to recognize and respond to bigotry or discrimination on campus.“An attack on any of our communities is an attack against all Californians and our state will not stand by as the forces of hate instigate acts of violent extremism that put lives at risk,” said Governor Newsom. “California is taking action with major investments to support anti-hate programs and enlisting the expertise of demonstrated leaders in Holocaust and genocide education to inoculate young people against the dangerous messages of hate and division pervading our public discourse.”

Launched by the Governor last year, the Council is co-chaired by State Senator Henry Stern, Attorney General Rob Bonta, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond and Dr. Anita Friedman, Executive Director, Jewish Family and Children’s Services/Northern California.

“Make no mistake: Antisemitism and bigotry remain a threat to the safety and well-being of our communities here in California and around the world,” said Attorney General Rob Bonta, Council Co-Chair. “The Governor’s Council is a critical part of our state’s efforts to combat hate before it can arise through education and early intervention. I’m incredibly proud to co-lead this effort and welcome the newest members to the council. Together, we can support and uplift all of our communities. The lessons of the past must never be forgotten.”

The new members announced today are distinguished leaders and experts in Holocaust and genocide education, representing organizations that reflect the diverse groups impacted by the Holocaust and genocide throughout history:

Beth Kean, CEO of the Holocaust Museum LA

Brian Fong, California Program Director for Facing History and Ourselves

Joyce Newstat, Former Chair of the Jewish Family and Children’s Services Holocaust Center

Kori Street, Deputy Executive Director of the USC Shoah Foundation

Liebe Geft, Director of the Museum of Tolerance

Michael Berenbaum, Director of the Sigi Ziering Institute, Professor of Jewish Studies at the American Jewish University

Roxanne Makasdjian, Executive Director of the Genocide Education Project

Seth Brysk, Central Pacific Regional Director for the Anti-Defamation League

Taylor Pennewell, Executive Director of the Redbud Resource Group

Governor Newsom previously named Assemblymembers Adrin Nazarian, Jose Medina, James Ramos and Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, and Senators Scott Wiener, Connie Leyva, and Susan Rubio to serve as members on the Council.



“I could not imagine a more important moment for this council to launch this critical work. The council members bring a depth of knowledge, experience, and expertise and I look forward to working with them as co-chair,” said State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, Co-Chair of the Council. “We know that comprehensive Holocaust Education implemented at all schools is an essential part of our effort to combat antisemitism and all forms of hate. The work of this council, along with the CDE’s anti-bias education training and Education to End Hate initiative, gives me hope that through education we can work in solidarity towards a better future for California students.”

The Council will assess the status of Holocaust and genocide education in California, make recommendations for how to improve Holocaust and genocide education in our schools, promote best practices for educators, schools and organizations and sponsor Holocaust and genocide remembrance.

“This is precisely the collection of thinkers and organizations we envisioned to help lead this Council,” said Co-Chair Senator Henry Stern. “I applaud Governor Newsom for not just condemning antisemitism when it’s broadcast across our freeways and social media channels, but for responding with substantive lasting solutions and the funds to realize those solutions. Whether you’re a Californian whose family suffered the death squads of El Salvador, the killing fields of Cambodia, or the gas chambers of Auschwitz, students and teachers across our state share a common bond of resilience in the face of trauma. Now is the moment we must take an honest look at whether our public schools are helping the next generation understand what happens when politicians use economic crises, ethnic and identity-based hatred, and clever coordinated mass communication to achieve monstrous results.”

“Governor Newsom understands that the alarming increase of hate and antisemitism requires effective moral leadership at the highest levels. His creation of a distinguished Council on Holocaust and Genocide Education sets the example for the State — and for the nation — and ensures that bigotry will find no place in our society,” said Co-Chair Dr. Anita Friedman.

Working with the Jewish Caucus and the Legislature, the Newsom Administration has funded more than $150 million to support anti-hate programs that provide direct support for impacted communities and victims, and an additional $115 million for the State Nonprofit Security Grant Program, which helps nonprofit organizations that are targets of hate-motivated violence improve security at their facilities. The state has also invested:

$40 million to rebuild six summer camps lost in recent wildfires, including Jewish summer camps

$36 million for the California Holocaust Survivor Assistance Program

$10 million for the Jewish Family Service Los Angeles for Holocaust Survivor Assistance

$10 million to fund the Anti-Bias Education Grant Program

$5 million for the Museum of Tolerance

$3 million to renovate and enhance the Jewish Family and Children’s Services Holocaust Center in San Francisco

$2 million to establish the Statewide Teacher Collaborative on Holocaust and Genocide Education to bring together all groups who teach this subject matter in order to share information, create a statewide central website and establish best teaching practices

$2 million for the International Genocide Memorial

$1.4 million for the Governor’s Council on Holocaust and Genocide Education

Governor Newsom last month signed legislation to extend the State Nonprofit Security Grant Program, which was codified under legislation signed by the Governor in 2019 following the Chabad of Poway shooting. The Governor last month also named appointments to the Commission on the State of Hate, created by legislation he signed last year to track hate crimes, develop anti-hate resources and make recommendations to better protect civil rights. In addition, the Governor signed an executive order that will help protect communities against hate violence and discrimination by accelerating the launch of a California versus Hate Resource Line and Network, among other actions.",Q4

A resignation letter never sent

As Donald Trump threatened to install loyalist Jeffrey Clark to lead the Justice Department, acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and top deputy Richard Donoghue threatened action that ultimately forced the then-president to blink.

A joint resignation letter, drafted Jan. 3, 2021, made clear that Rosen and Donoghue would not be parts of a campaign to use the Justice Department to subvert the election, as Trump had repeatedly demanded.

“This evening, after Acting Attorney General Jeff Rosen over the course of the last week repeatedly refused the President’s direct instructions to utilize the Department of Justice’s law enforcement powers for improper ends, the President removed Jeff from the Department… Rich Donoghue and I resign from the Department, effectively immediately,” the draft stated.

The letter was not the only card Rosen and Donoghue were prepared to play. Before a planned meeting with Trump that evening at the White House, Justice Department officials arranged a conference call with top leaders who also agreed to resign if Clark was appointed.

The letter was never sent, as the threat of mass resignations prompted Trump to stand down.

Trump aides joked ‘dead voter’ claims exaggerated

Even as then-President Donald Trump and his legal team continued to claim that more than 10,000 dead people had voted in the 2020 election in Georgia, top White House aides jokingly acknowledged the exaggeration.

Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and senior adviser Eric Herschmann, in an early December exchange of messages, privately debunked the assertions as Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani pressed the case in Georgia.

Meadows said that his son had found a scant “12 obituaries and 6 other possibles depending on the Voter roll acuracy [sic].”

Said Herschmann: “That sounds more like it. Maybe he can help Rudy find the other 10k ??""

'Scared' Kevin McCarthy called Jared Kushner – in the shower – for help in getting Trump to call off the rioters

The Jan. 6 committee disclosed that the Republican House leader tried repeatedly to reach former President Donald Trump, “and did at least once” while also asking multiple members of Trump’s family for help, including senior White House aides Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.

“Kushner characterized Leader McCarthy’s demeanor on the call as “scared,” according to Kushner’s testimony. “I could hear in his voice that he really was nervous, and so, obviously, I took that seriously” and wanted to help. “I turned the shower off, threw on a suit, and, you know, and rushed into the White House as quickly as I could.”

Asked what McCarthy had asked Kushner for help with, he said, “I don't recall a specific ask, just anything you could do. Again, I got the sense that, you know, (lawmakers in the Capitol) were—they were—you know, they were scared.”

RNC staffer refused to say Trump won Pennsylvania, report says

Ethan Katz, a Republican National Committee staffer in 2020, was asked to write a fundraising email saying former President Donald Trump had won Pennsylvania before the state had been called for either candidate.

Katz refused, and three weeks after the election he lost his job. His supervisor Hannah Allred, during an interview with the Jan. 6 committee, said she didn’t know why he was fired and the decision was not hers to make, according to the report.

In the days after the 2020 election, Katz had also challenged Trump campaign staffers about how copywriters were supposed to explain to voters the campaign wanted to keep counting votes in Arizona but stop counting votes in other battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Georgia and Michigan, according to the committee report.

'Entire White House senior staff' wanted Trump to issue a statement instructing the violent rioters to leave the Capitol, but Trump refused

The committee’s final report disclosed that “the entire White House senior staff was in favor of a Presidential statement” urging all rioters to leave the Capitol. It cited, among other things, previously undisclosed testimony by then-White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.

“And when you talk about others on the staff thinking more should be done, or thinking that the President needed to tell people to go home, who would you put in that category?” committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney asked Cipollone during his testimony before the committee. Cipollone ticked off a long list of top staffers, including Pat Philbin, Eric Herschmann, chief of staff Mark Meadows and Trump’s daughter Ivanka. In fact, Cipollone responded, “I can’t think of anybody on that day who didn’t want people to get out of the Capitol once the—particularly once the violence started.”

As the committee disclosed during its televised hearings, an eyewitness said Meadows told Cipollone as the rioters broke into the Capitol that Trump “doesn’t want to do anything.” Cipollone confirmed to Cheney the gist of that exchange. “I had a conversation I’m sure with Mark Meadows, I’m sure with other people, of what I thought should be done,” Cipollone testified. “Did Mark say that to me? I don’t have a recollection of him saying that to me, but he may have said something along the lines.”

Trump floated plan for 10,000 National Guard troops to protect him in march to Capitol

Two days before the Jan. 6 assault, then-President Donald Trump persisted in his desire to accompany demonstrators on a march to the Capitol, suggesting that 10,000 National Guard troops could provide protection for him and an entourage.

According to the committee, White House Senior Advisor Max Miller “shot it down immediately” out of concern for Trump’s safety, indicating that there was no additional conversation about the National Guard protection plan.

“Just glad we killed the national guard and a procession,” Miller later texted to Trump aide Katrina Pierson.

The episode stands out, as there is no evidence that Trump ever called on the National Guard to put down the eventual riot at the Capitol, contributing to the long-delayed military response to the violent assault.

RNC fundraised on Trump’s false claims

The Republican National Committee received millions in donations during the days that followed the 2020 election, having its most successful period of the campaign cycle while giving credence to former President Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated claims that he won, according to the Jan. 6 committee’s final report.

Trump and the RNC raised a combined $250 million after the 2020 election – mostly from small donors who believed they were giving money to help “stop the steal.”

– Candy Woodall

But RNC knew Trump lost and changed language to protect from 'legal exposure,' report says

But interviews and internal documents show the RNC knew Trump had lost, and its legal team maneuvered behind the scenes to carefully choose its language, the report said. For example, the RNC’s legal team advised copywriters to change language from “steal the election” to “try to steal the election,” according to the report. Copywriters were also advised not to use the term “rigged” or say that Joe Biden lost or Trump won. Instead, they were encouraged to use phrases like “finish the fight” and Trump “got 71 million legal votes.”

“Evidence obtained by the Select Committee shows that the RNC knew that President Trump’s claims about winning the election were baseless and that additional donations would not help him secure an additional term in office,” the report said. “They walked as close to the line as they dared—making several changes to fundraising copy that seemingly protected the RNC from legal exposure while still spreading and relying on President Trump’s known lies and misrepresentations.”

Longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone connective thread between extremist groups

Roger Stone, a longtime political adviser to former President Donald Trump, had close ties to right-wing activists pushing incendiary rhetoric leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack and the extremist groups who led the charge that day.

At a November 2020 protest in Atlanta – led by InfoWars' Alex Jones, white supremacist Nick Fuentes and right-wing activist Ali Alexander, and secured by members of the extremist groups Proud Boys and Oath Keepers – Stone gave a speech via phone advancing election fraud claims and urging “victory or death,” the report says.

The Trump adviser was also in a Signal group chat titled “Friends of Stone” that included Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes, Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio and other members of extremist groups. Days after the election, Stone messaged in the chat: “We provide information several times a day. So please monitor the F.O.S. feed so you can act in a timely fashion.”

Stone was interviewed by the committee, though he invoked the Fifth Amendment in response to more than 70 questions about the Capitol attack and his communications with Trump, the panel said.

The Trump pressure campaign on state officials, by the numbers

The plan to overturn election results in the states by disregarding actual vote counts and appointing fake Trump electors was set in motion shortly after the 2020 presidential election, and by the time Biden’s victory was certified had included hundreds of instances of outreach by Trump loyalists, the report concludes.

The plan – which even top Trump aide Dan Scavino called “crazy,” according to the report, involved pressuring state legislators to effectively change the outcome of the election.

The Jan. 6 committee did the math on what that entailed for Trump and his inner circle:

68 meetings, attempted or connected phone calls, or text messages aimed at state or local officials

18 instances of prominent public remarks targeting the officials

125 social media posts, mostly from Trump

The campaign contacted or tried to contact 200 state legislators, the report says. Hundreds joined a private briefing with Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and lawyer John Eastman. Trump urged attendees to exercise “the real power” to select electors that would keep him in power.

Trump’s intent to go to the Capitol is what counts, report says

The final report says “it is difficult to fully reconcile” divergent accounts about Trump’s purported efforts to go to the Capitol after his Jan. 6, 2021, speech – including whether he tried to get physical with a member of his security detail.

But that’s not important, it’s Trump’s intent that counts, the report said.

“The principal factual point here is clear and undisputed: President Trump specifically and repeatedly requested to be taken to the Capitol. He was insistent and angry, and continued to push to travel to the Capitol even after returning to the White House,” the report said. Noting that the presidential motorcade did not disband, as usual, upon reaching the White House, the report said a Secret Service document shows that Trump planned “on holding at the White House for the next approximate two hours, then moving to the Capitol.”

High-profile Jan. 6 cases surface in report

Capitol rioters embroiled in some of the Justice Department’s most high-profile prosecutions related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack made cameos in the House committee’s final report.

The report’s section on the conspiracy movement QAnon is opened with a description of Doug Jensen, an Iowa construction worker who chased U.S. Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman through the Capitol while wearing a “Q” shirt. Jensen was found guilty of seven criminal charges tied to the Capitol attack and sentenced to five years in prison.

Jacob Chansley, better known as the “QAnon Shaman,” was pointed out by the committee as evidence of rioters’ susceptibility to former President Donald Trump’s directives. After the former president released a message urging the rioters to “go home,” Chansley told a crowd: “I’m here delivering the President’s message. Donald Trump has asked everybody to go home.” Another responded to Chansley: “That’s our order,” the report says. Chansley pleaded guilty in his Capitol riot case and was sentenced to 41 months in prison.

Details from the trial of five Oath Keepers – plus allegations against members of the Proud Boys, who await trial – bolstered the committee’s argument that the Capitol assault was planned by some in advance.

Dozens of witnesses impeded the Jan. 6 committee investigation by invoking the Fifth Amendment or refusing to testify, panel says

The committee revealed that it believed its investigation was impeded in serious ways by the fact that more than 30 witnesses invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, while others invoked executive privilege “or categorically refused to appear,” including Trump confidante and former advisor Steve Bannon, who was later convicted of contempt of Congress.

Many Trump lawyers and supporters, including Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, Phil Waldron, and former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, all took the fifth when asked by the committee “what supposed proof they uncovered that the election was stolen.” Others who were central to understanding whether Trump conspired with others to engage in seditious conspiracy also took the fifth, the committee said, including Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows. Meadows, who refused to testify and was held in contempt of Congress, “could have specific evidence relevant to such charges, as may (other) witnesses who invoked their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination before this Committee.”

The committee said it was “particularly troubling” that certain witnesses took the fifth, including Flynn, for refusing to comment on such basic questions as whether he believed the violence on Jan. 6 was justified and whether he believed “in the peaceful transition of power” in the U.S. The House panel also suggested “that the Department of Justice further examine possible efforts to obstruct our investigation,” including why so many witnesses took the Fifth and what they might have been trying to hide.

'Potus likes the crazies’: Trump aide concerned about Ellipse rally

While planning the Jan. 6, 2021, rally near the White House, an aide to then-President Donald Trump expressed deep concern about including election fraud promoters Roger Stone and Alex Jones.

In testimony before the House committee, Trump aide Katrina Pierson referred to Jones’ involvement in a volatile November 2020 demonstration as the “kind of thing” that gave her pause. But Pierson also acknowledged in a text message to an associate of the pressure Trump was exerting to pump up the crowd, saying “POTUS . . . likes the crazies.”

“Pierson said that she believed this was the case because President Trump ‘loved people who viciously defended him in public.’ But their 'vicious' defenses of the President clearly troubled Pierson.”

The lineup of controversial speakers was described as the “original psycho list,” and Pierson was so troubled that she reached out to Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows for help. “Things have gotten crazy and I desperately need some direction,” Pierson wrote.

Extremist groups, QAnon adherents led charge into the Capitol, committee finds

Members of right-wing extremist groups and adherents to the conspiracy movement QAnon led the assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, the House committee investigating the attack said in its final report.

The report found that members of the Proud Boys, who allegedly planned to storm the Capitol ahead of the riot, “led the attack at key breach points.” Members of the Oath Keepers formed military-style “stacks” to gain entry to the building. And extremists like the militia group Three Percenters, white nationalist Groypers and QAnon believers egged the mob on at the “frontlines,” the panel found.

“The January 6th attack has often been described as a riot — and that is partly true. Some of those who trespassed on the Capitol’s grounds or entered the building did not plan to do so beforehand,” the committee wrote. “But it is also true that extremists, conspiracy theorists and others were prepared to fight. That is an insurrection.”

Liz Cheney: ‘The most shameful findings’

GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, vice chair of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack, laid out in the beginning of the report what the committee found “among the most shameful findings” from the hearings: “President Trump sat in the dining room off the Oval Office watching the violent riot at the Capitol on television.”

The committee, like a previous USA TODAY report, said for hours Trump did not issue a public statement urging his supporters to leave the Capitol “despite urgent pleas from his White House staff and dozens of others to do so.”

During those 187 minutes when Trump was publicly silent, “law enforcement agents were attacked and seriously injured, the Capitol was invaded, the electoral count was halted and the lives of those in the Capitol were put at risk,” Cheney said.

Trump called claims of Dominion voting systems fraud 'crazy' before pushing that narrative himself

Top Trump advisor Hope Hicks told the Jan. 6 committee that Trump laughed at his campaign lawyer Sidney Powell's claims of how three foreign countries had helped Joe Biden win by manipulating Dominion voting systems – before going public with how Dominion lost him the election through widespread fraud.

Trump’s comments on Nov. 20, 2020 came a day after Powell and two other Trump campaign lawyers, Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis, held a press conference at Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, where Powell claimed there was a “massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba, and likely China in the interference with our elections here in the United States.” She singled out Dominion’s election software and did the same in the follow-up call to Trump.

“While (Powell) was speaking, the President muted his speakerphone and laughed at Powell, telling the others in the room, ‘This does sound crazy, doesn’t it?'” But while the Trump campaign soon distanced itself from Powell, Trump began pushing the same narrative through tweets and other comments, the committee said.

Details emerge of parking garage meeting between Oath Keepers, Proud Boys leaders

Leaders of the right-wing extremist groups Oath Keepers and Proud Boys discussed standing as a united front on Jan. 6, 2021, during a parking garage meeting that took place the day prior, according to the final report by the House committee investigating the Capitol attack.

During the meeting, Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio acknowledged that he and Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes “don’t get along,” but needed to “unite regardless of our differences” in a “situation like this.” Tarrio had just been released from custody and ordered to leave Washington, D.C. after burning a church’s Black Lives Matter banner.

Parts of the meeting were captured on video by documentary filmmaker Nick Quested, though the committee conceded that much of the discussion between the two extremist group leaders is unknown because Quested was asked to stop filming. But the committee determined that the Oath Keepers' quick reaction forces, stockpiled with firearms in Virginia, were discussed at the meeting, according to the report.

Oath Keepers lawyer: 'Storming the Capitol' discussed, but 'normal'

Also present at the meeting were Latinos for Trump leader Bianca Gracia and Oath Keepers lawyer Kelley SoRelle.

SoRelle told the panel that right-wing political activists – including Gracia, Rhodes, Vets for Trump leader Joshua Macias and Virginia State Sen. Amanda Chase – discussed “storming the Capitol” at a get-together ahead of the parking garage meeting, though she claimed talk like that was “normal” and not indicative of violence.

‘No evidence’ delayed National Guard response was intentional

The House committee described the National Guard’s delayed response to the Capitol violence as “unnecessary and unacceptable,” but the panel concluded that there was “no evidence” officials intended to deny assistance.

Investigators said the poor response was the “byproduct of military processes and institutional caution.”

“We have no evidence that the delay was intentional,” the committee concluded. “Likewise, it appears that none of the individuals involved understood what President Trump planned for January 6th, and how he would behave during the violence.”

The panel noted then-President Donald Trump’s unexpected “active encouragement” of the rioters, as prompting the “full-blown” assault that ultimately outpaced the response.

Trump tried to speak with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger 18 times

Much has been reported about the phone call on Jan. 2, 2021, when Trump asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” votes to overturn Joe Biden’s election in the state.

But the final Jan. 6 committee report reveals just how vociferously the former president was chasing any basis to stay in power. Before the call, the report notes, Trump “had tried to speak by phone with Raffensperger at least 18 times.”

“Raffensperger, for his part, had avoided talking to the President because of ongoing litigation with the President’s Campaign,” the report says.

When they did speak, with lawyers on the line, Trump made the infamous ask of Georgia’s top election official to “find 11,780 votes” to tip the state his way. Not to do so, Trump threatened, would be a criminal offense.

RNC staffers were assigned to help with fake electors scheme

The final report from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack further revealed details surrounding the Trump campaign’s effort to send an alternate slate of electors to Congress in the former president’s effort to stay in power.

Republican National Committee Ronna McDaniel testified that former President Donald Trump and his attorney John Eastman in a phone call asked for the RNC’s help in gathering a slate of fake electors ahead of Dec. 14, 2020 in case the Trump campaign won any of its legal challenges.

The Jan. 6 report shows McDaniel called back Trump soon after that call ended, “letting him know that she agreed to his request and that some RNC staffers were already assisting.”

Ex-Overstock.com CEO paid for Proud Boys leader’s flight to DC protest, committee says

Businessman Patrick Byrne, former Overstock CEO, paid for Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio’s travel by private jet to a November 2020 protest in Washington where he met with other extremists, according to the Jan. 6 committee’s final report.

Tarrio met with Ali Alexander, the “Stop the Steal” organizer, and described the Nov. 14 Million MAGA March protest as a “historic” meeting of Trump supporters, the report says.

Byrne confirmed that he paid for the flight on Friday, suggesting in a tweet he was told that “a bunch of patriotic Latinos” wanted to attend the rally before agreeing to front the cost for their travel.

A month after the protest, on Dec. 18, Byrne argued to Trump in a White House meeting that he had the authority to seize voting machines under a 2018 executive order, the report says. The suggestion was “forcefully condemned” by other administration officials at the meeting, according to the report.

Risk to Capitol was ‘foreseeable’

Although the House committee heaped primary blame on former President Donald Trump for the deadly Capitol assault, the report also offered a damning account of law enforcement’s response to troubling intelligence gathered in the weeks before the attack.

“Federal and local law enforcement authorities were in possession of multiple streams of intelligence predicting violence directed at the Capitol prior to January 6th,” the committee concluded. “Although some of that intelligence was fragmentary, it should have been sufficient to warrant far more vigorous preparations for the security of the joint session.”

The panel said the failure to share and act on the warnings “jeopardized the lives of the police officers defending the Capitol and everyone in it.”

“While the danger to the Capitol posed by an armed and angry crowd was foreseeable, the fact that the President of the United States would be the catalyst of their fury and facilitate the attack was unprecedented in American history.”

Ban Trump from government office?

Those who swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, and then engaged in insurrection during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot should be barred from government office of any kind, the committee’s final report recommends. The report based the proposal on the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which includes a disqualification clause originally intended to keep Confederates from taking part in the government after the Civil War.

The report said disqualification also should apply to former President Donald Trump.

“The Select Committee has referred Donald Trump and others for possible prosecution … including for assisting and providing aid and comfort to an insurrection,” the report said. “The Committee also notes that Donald J. Trump was impeached by a majority of the House of Representatives for Incitement of an Insurrection, and there were 57 votes in the Senate for his conviction.”

Trump speechwriter during Jan. 6 riot: ‘Potus im sure is loving this’

As rioters stormed the Capitol and the chilling images played out on television across the nation, Trump wanted to talk about upending the counting of electoral votes that would validate Biden’s victory.

“I said, ‘Mr. President, they’ve taken the Vice President out. They want me to get off the phone, I gotta go,’” Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., recalled telling him.

Trump then rang Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. The Republican leader said he urged the president to go on TV and Twitter and “call these people off.”

But the president was non-plussed, falsely asserting they weren’t his people and then telling McCarthy, “Kevin, maybe these people are just more angry about this than you are.”

As the violence at the Capitol escalated, Trump’s speechwriter, Gabriel Robert texted someone, “Potus im sure is loving this.”

Trump reacts to Jan. 6 committee report

Former President Donald Trump on Thursday condemned the final report of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, decrying it as a “witch hunt” again.

Rather than respond to the report’s specific findings, Trump criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's over security issues. The post: ""The highly partisan Unselect Committee Report purposely fails to mention the failure of Pelosi to heed my recommendation for troops to be used in D.C., show the 'Peacefully and Patrioticly' words I used, or study the reason for the protest, Election Fraud. WITCH HUNT!""

There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election.

Read the full PDF of the Jan. 6 committee report here

The committee’s final report made 17 findings about the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, including that Trump plotted to overturn the 2020 results despite knowing he’d lost, sent an angry and armed mob to the Capitol and failed to respond to the violence as it unfolded on television.

Committee recommended Trump be prosecuted at final hearing

The committee voted Monday 9-0 to refer four criminal referrals against Trump to the Justice Department: obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make a false statement, and ""incite,"" ""assist"" or ""aid and comfort"" an insurrection.

There could be enough evidence for criminal charges against other Trump allies, like attorneys John Eastman, Rudy Giuliani, Jeffrey Clark and Kenneth Chesebro, the panel said.

The committee also is recommending the House Ethics Committee investigate four Republican lawmakers – including Kevin McCarthy, the potential next House speaker – for defying the committee's subpoenas.

Jan. 6 committee final report: How we got here

Throughout nine public hearings, the committee made the case that Trump oversaw a ""sprawling, multistep conspiracy"" to overturn the election and prevent the transfer of presidential power to Joe Biden.

In October, the House panel took the extraordinary step of formally subpoenaing Trump, kicking off a legal battle with the former president who has denounced the committee's investigation as political.

Though the committee's work has been widely lauded by the left, it has drawn ire from Republicans, who dismissed the panel's work as partisan writ large. With the GOP set to retake the House in January after winning a majority, the committee's end is imminent.

EMERSON, Ga. — The City of Emerson, in Bartow County, is grieving the loss of its longtime mayor Al Pallone and his wife Millie. They were killed in a car accident allegedly caused by a drunk driver.

Al Pallone first won a seat on Emerson’s City Council during Bill Clinton’s first term – a 38-year run of public service that ended tragically Saturday.

""To lose someone who has been in the Emerson City Government for almost 40 years,"" City Councilman Vincent Wiley said. He added the emotions are still raw in Emerson.

A few days ago, Mayor Al Pallone presided over Emerson's Christmas festival.

""Obviously we’re not doing well. It’s a shock to lose the mayor,"" Wiley said.

The Pallones were killed on a stretch of SR 20 near Lake Allatoona. City officials said the area is notorious for traffic accidents.

Sheriff’s deputies arrested another driver and charged him with DUI.

""Mayor Pallone was just phenomenal,"" said Jerry Haney, who serves on the board of the Excel Christian Academy – a school in downtown Emerson which, he said, thrived with strong personal support from Mayor Pallone.

Pallone served Emerson for 15 years as mayor and another 26 years as a city council member. He made $1,500 annually to serve as mayor, officials said, a minimal salary for an elected official.

Friends said Millie and Al Pallone were devoted parents and grandparents. Wiley is taking the unwanted step of temporarily filling Al Pallone’s job in Emerson’s Mayor’s Office.

""I’m thrown into interim mayor, mayor pro tem you know. I’m kind of scared but you know what? I can hear Al saying, 'you know, you can do it,'"" Wiley said.

A city council meeting scheduled for Monday has been canceled. At a meeting in January, the council is expected to formalize which member will finish Al Pallone’s term as mayor. Wiley added the next municipal election is about 11 months from now.",Q4

“Tonight, terror has reached our doorstep,” Gov. Roy Cooper said. “The nightmare of every community has come to Raleigh.”

Neither the victims nor the suspect were immediately identified. A civilian victim was in critical condition Thursday night.

Police did not publicly speculate on a motive for the shooting.

The shooting came just four days after five people were shot dead at a home in Inman, S.C., about 200 miles southwest of Raleigh. Police arrested 24-year-old James Douglas Drayton in that shooting and charged him with five counts of murder, among other crimes.

A Secret Service spokesperson told CNN that the agency had contact with the extremist group, whose founder and other members are currently on trial, as part of its standard intelligence-gathering duties.

The official told CNN that members of the extremist group had occasionally reached out to the agency regarding items that they were allowed to bring to rallies.

“We are aware that individuals from the Oath Keepers have contacted us in the past to make inquiries,” Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the news organisation.

The official stated that it was commonplace for agents to also reach out and contact the group when they found out they would be attending events and demonstrations.

The Secret Service’s relationship with the group has been brought up in the trial of the group’s leader Stewart Rhodes.

A court heard that Mr Rhodes had claimed he was in contact with a Secret Service agent in the months leading up to the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by Donald Trump’s supporters.

John Zimmerman, a former member of the group, testified in the trial of Mr Rhodes and four other Oath Keepers who are charged with seditious conspiracy in what prosecutors have described as a plot to use force to stop the transfer of presidential power from Mr Trump to Democrat Joe Biden, who won the election.

Mr Zimmerman told a jury that he witnessed a phone call between Mr Rhodes and a purported Secret Service agent in September 20202 at a Trump rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

Mr Zimmerman could not say for sure that Mr Rhodes was speaking to someone with the Secret Service — only that Rhodes told him he was — and it was not clear what they were discussing.

Mr Zimmerman said Mr Rhodes wanted to find out the “parameters” that the Oath Keepers could operate under during the election-year rally.

Plastic bags containing fliers with antisemitic messages were left on driveways and in front of homes in San Marino and Pasadena at the start of the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur on Tuesday night, according to authorities.

A San Marino resident noticed someone placed a flier on their driveway, and they reported the incident to police around 11 p.m. Fliers were left on several driveways throughout the San Gabriel Valley city, but the placement appears to be random and not targeted at any particular groups in the neighborhood, according to the San Marino Police Department.

The items were placed inside plastic bags with rocks and contained antisemitic messages and COVID-19 conspiracies. The fliers state that they were “distributed randomly without malicious intent,” police said in a Facebook post.

There were no reports of property damage or any other activities stemming from the incident. Police interviewed residents and some offered to share surveillance footage from their homes if they are able to spot any suspicious individuals or vehicles. Detectives will investigate the incident, but San Marino was not alone, because fliers were also found in the southern part of Pasadena, according to Lisa Derderian, a city spokesperson.

The fliers were found Wednesday morning and police said they have documented the addresses where they were left. Police said they will also increase patrols in the area.

“The City of Pasadena takes a zero-tolerance position against all forms of hate speech, which has no place in our city especially on the highest Jewish holiday of the year,” the city of Pasadena said in a written statement. “The distribution of [antisemitic] flyers goes against the values of our city and its residents. We recognize many are hurt by these disgusting acts and know Pasadena residents stand together and speak out against hatred in all forms.”

Jeffrey Abrams, Los Angeles’ regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, said the group behind these antisemitic acts is small, but growing.

“We know who these people are. They target predominantly Jewish communities and hide behind the First Amendment when they leaflet these neighborhoods,” Abrams told The Times. “Make no mistake, the purpose is to terrorize those communities.”

While Abrams asked people not to share images of the antisemitic fliers on social media, he does encourage the media to report when these episodes take place.

“Antisemitism is alive and growing in our city,” Abrams said.

Antisemitic fliers were left on the front doors of homes in Beverly Hills in April, the morning after the first Passover Seder. The fliers began with the statement, “Every Single Aspect of The Ukraine-Russia War is Jewish,” and it was followed by a list of government officials.

https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-11-16/twitter-employees-commentary,"Commentary: $44 billion can buy Twitter, but it can’t buy respect","Twitter has always been a weird place, but things have gotten more feral the last couple of weeks thanks to the service’s off-putting new owner, Elon Musk. A role model in the worst way, his trolling and despotic workplace practices have set the tone for a grass-roots insurrection inside the internet’s so-called town square.

Let’s start with the users defiling the site with parodies of Musk and prominent corporations. It’s an obvious effort to monkey-wrench Musk’s efforts to juice revenues to pay for the company’s debt-laden $44-billion acquisition, and the vandalism seems to have left its mark. Risk-averse advertisers, who previously provided almost all of Twitter’s income, have been fleeing, for some reason not attracted back by Musk’s promise to “thermonuclear name & shame” them for leaving.

There’s a growing fear that the company might go bankrupt, as Musk himself suggested last week. Or that Musk has already laid off so many employees (half of the staff have been let go so far) that one day someone will delete an obscure line of code that was keeping the whole app running. Mild-mannered users I follow have given their own votes of no-confidence by pre-emptively saying goodbye, in the fond sort of way you might expect if an unstoppable asteroid were days from impact.

It’s nice to know that in the moments before unavoidable vaporization or completely avoidable server failure, one’s thoughts turn to love; many thoughts also seem to be turning toward inviting followers to switch over to rival services such Instagram, Substack or the upstart Mastodon.

Then there are the Twitter survivalists, quietly reaching out via direct message, asking if we could mutually agree to delete our private chat history in case of some sort of reputation-destroying security breach. If our fragile little online society is going to break down, these are the people focused on the business of surviving if looting erupts. Musk’s changes have already interfered with the service’s two-factor authentication protection, a critical security tool to protect users’ accounts.

This is the loser stink wafting off Twitter among many of its longtime regular users right now, despite Musk’s claims of modest gains of user engagement under his ownership, which have also coincided with the newsy U.S. midterm season.

The more Musk-friendly view of the situation is that Twitter had gotten too corporate, too censorious — too boring in recent years, and it needed drastic change. Twitter had never been all that much of a moneymaker when it was publicly traded. President Trump got banned from the site after his followers’ Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection to avoid “the risk of further incitement of violence”; he also happened to be one of the site’s most popular, engaged-with users. Conservatives emigrated under what they felt was a too liberal-flavored content-moderation regime. Many power users and celebrities simply wandered away for their own reasons, spending more time on visual platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Some people thought the place needed a dictator figure to clean things up; co-founder Jack Dorsey called Musk “the singular solution I trust.”

But even Caesars need Roman senators who won’t stab them in the back if they want to reign long enough to enjoy the empire. At almost every possible turn, Musk has alienated key constituencies seemingly necessary for Twitter’s success — his actions suggest contracts don’t really need to be honored, advertisers don’t really need to be wooed, experts don’t really need to be heeded, or users don’t really need to be courted.

Perhaps most bewildering of all is Musk’s increasingly public abuse of his own employees, the workers frantically trying to overhaul the service so he can earn his billions back. The company’s initial mass layoff had gone over poorly, with many learning they’d been cut after realizing they couldn’t log into their laptops anymore. This week, Musk, a notoriously bad boss, is celebrating the termination of several more Twitter employees who had publicly suggested that Musk doesn’t actually know what he’s talking about or who had privately vented on the company Slack.

“I would like to apologize for firing these geniuses. Their immense talent will no doubt be of great use elsewhere,” Musk tweeted sarcastically Tuesday after several Twitter employees were reportedly fired for criticizing him, adding of one specific employee: “A tragic case of adult onset Tourette’s.” Imagine Disney buying more ads to place next to this sort of stuff.

Demonstrating anything less than servility to the world’s wealthiest man seems to make Musk lash out, which is probably one of the reasons he hates journalists and left-wing politicians so much. Maybe you can get away with that more easily as the owner of a rocket company or a car company. But that’s a real risk for an owner of a social media platform, especially the service whose users are infamous for cyberbullying the thinnest-skinned targets they can find. Every story about Musk’s lieutenants hunting for minor critics to severely punish only throws chum in the water for his haters, who now have far more surface area to attack. Several fired Twitter employees have publicly celebrated their own terminations with the salute emoji, a sign of solidarity rather than solemn contrition.

It’s not clear how any of this makes users want to give their hard-earned money to an ill-tempered billionaire, or why other workers might want to subject themselves to this kind of work environment. Or how any of this serves the cause of free speech, public enlightenment or democracy itself. It’s not even clear how any of this serves the company’s survivability, let alone its profitability.

Musk’s objectives aren’t clear because they don’t have to be clear; under the law, some of the world’s most critical communications infrastructure now belongs to him, to destroy as he personally pleases — or to transform into his own erratic image, if he can manage it.

Twitter employees getting fired for talking back clarifies one thing, though: $44 billion can buy you Twitter, but it can’t buy you respect.",Q4
https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/butler-county/west-chester/west-chester-quadruple-murder-trial-jury-could-reach-verdict-today,"West Chester quadruple murder trial: Jury deadlocked, sent back to deliberation","HAMILTON, Ohio — There is still no consensus from the jury on whether Gurpreet Singh is innocent or guilty of murdering four members of his family including his wife, Shalinderjit Kaur; her parents Hakiakat Singh Pannag and Parmjit Kaur; and Parmjit's sister, Amarjit Kaur.

The jury began deliberating Wednesday afternoon, but entered the courtroom almost 12 hours later to tell Judge Gregory Howard it is not able to unanimously reach a verdict yet. Howard asked if there was a possibility the jurors could reach an agreement after additional time, to which the foreperson said yes.

""Very well then, I want you to go back into the jury room and I want you to continue with your deliberations,"" Howard said.

After 14 hours, the judge sent the jurors back to their hotel rooms. Deliberation will resume in the morning.

Family of the four killed have been in and out of the courtroom, anxious for a verdict. Garry Hans, whose mother Amarjit was killed in the shooting, said he could not sleep the night before, but seeing handfuls of people from Cincinnati's Sikh community support them brings some relief.

""It means a lot (that) like whole Sikh community from Cincinnati and other places, they come and help us,"" Hans said. ""And some people they come, they calling us and they're (watching) the news. They're watching live trial and they're sending blessings to us.""

Between sessions, family members said they have been going to their temple to pray.

Prosecutors spent 10 days trying to convince jurors Singh pulled the trigger, while Singh's defense called just one witness to testify Wednesday morning.

Christopher Robinson, a former crime lab director for the City of Atlanta, runs a forensics consulting firm hired to be a blood spatter expert for the defense. Robinson told jurors he reviewed evidence reports made by Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation agents. Based on DNA, Gurpeet Singh could not be the killer, Robinson testified. Investigators found blood on the clothes Singh wore that night. However, it contained only a confirmed DNA profile that belonged to Shalinderjit.

""In my opinion, I think it'd be impossible for a shooter to come in here and shoot four people and only have one person's DNA and (that) can be accounted for by him holding his wife because he found them,"" Robinson told jurors. ""There's no way, no evidence to conclude that Gurpreet was the shooter of these victims.""

Prosecutors attacked Robinson's credentials and credibility. When questioned on the stand, Robinson admitted he'd been fired from his job with the Atlanta crime lab.

During closing arguments, Butler County assistant prosecutors Josh Muennich and Jon Marshall told jurors Singh is the only possible killer.

Prosecutors said Singh's marriage and finances unraveled because he spent almost $45,000 on a long-standing affair with a woman in Indianapolis named Navkiran Kaur. Singh's family found out and planned to keep money from a land deal in India away from Gurpreet, prosecutors told jurors.

The night of the murders, April 28, 2019, prosecutors said Singh arranged to have his cousins keep his three children away from the family's apartment.

Cell phone, car GPS and Google data also put Singh inside his apartment minutes before the killings, Muennich told jurors. Prosecutors claim the killer shot victims from behind, suggesting the shooter was not a stranger to those killed.

""All the evidence in this case leads to one person and one person only and that's this defendant,"" Muennich told the jury during closing arguments. ""Ladies and gentlemen that's why he is guilty beyond any doubt of committing the crime of aggravated murder.""

Singh's lead attorney, Charlie Rittgers, pushed back.

""None of three of (the victims') blood is on Gurpreet Singh,"" Rittgers told jurors. ""None. Hakiakat, Parmjit, Amarjit. None of it. You (saw) how gory these crime scene photos are and the back spatter that would be created and yet there's none on Gurpreet. None of it.""

Closing arguments lasted four hours with Rittgers pushing 14 reasons for reasonable doubt.

""They're trying to kill a man,"" he told Rittgers said during closing arguments. ""They are resting their case on the fact that Gurpreet was not completely, openly honest by openly speaking with police about every detail of what happened. We're in the United States of America. We're in the United States of America. You don't have to talk to the police. Lying to the police is not a crime and it's not a reason to convict a person of murder.""

""(The victims) were alive until he got home,"" Marshall told the jury. ""That is the one uncontroverted fact in this case that cannot be explained away that can't be addressed with fantastical, rhetorical questions, what ifs, or anything else. The simple truth of this case is that at 9:09 p.m. this defendant arrived in the parking lot and by 9:11 p.m. he was inside that apartment and those four innocent people, they were alive.""

A graduate student at Washington State University was arrested Friday in his home state of Pennsylvania in last month’s killings of four University of Idaho students in their off-campus home — a brutal attack that rattled a small college town, authorities said.

A criminal complaint charging Bryan Kohberger, 28, with four counts of murder in the first degree, as well as felony burglary, was filed Thursday, Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson said in a news conference Friday afternoon in Idaho.

Authorities narrowed their focus to Kohberger after tracing his ownership of a white Hyundai Elantra seen in the area of the killings, according to two law enforcement sources briefed on the investigation. Kohberger’s DNA has also been matched to genetic material recovered at the off-campus house where the students were stabbed to death, according to the sources.

Genetic genealogy helped investigators identify the suspect, a source with knowledge of the case said. DNA found in Idaho was taken through a public database to find potential matches for family members, the source said. Once potential family matches were found, subsequent investigative work by law enforcement led to the identification of Kohberger, according to the source.

The suspect drove across country in the white car to his parents’ house, according to another law enforcement source. “Sometime right before Christmas we were zeroing in on him being in or going to Pennsylvania,” the source told CNN.

An FBI surveillance team from the Philadelphia field office had been tracking him for four days in the area where he was arrested, according to the sources.

While he was being watched, investigators from the Moscow Police Department, the Idaho State Police homicide bureau, and the FBI worked with prosecutors to develop sufficient probable cause to obtain the warrant. Once the arrest warrant was issued, the Pennsylvania State Police and the FBI made the arrest.

Moscow Police Department Chief James Fry said at the news conference an Elantra has been located, but investigators are still looking for the knife used in the killings. He didn’t reveal any details about the case, including when the suspect became the focus of the investigation or whether he knew the four students who were killed.

“These murders have shaken our community and no arrest will ever bring back these young students,” Fry said. “However, we do believe justice will be found through the criminal process.”

Fry said it was a very complex, extensive case.

“We developed a clear picture over time,” he said, “(but) be assured that the work is not done. This is just started.”

Authorities at the news conference asked the public to keep calling the tip line with information.

After the suspect returns to Idaho, a probable cause affidavit used to obtain the arrest warrant will be unsealed.

Records show Kohberger was arraigned Friday morning in Pennsylvania, and he has a court hearing on extradition January 3. Thompson said the suspect is being held without bail, and he is being represented while in Pennsylvania by a public defender.

Because the suspect was arrested in Pennsylvania, he has the opportunity to waive extradition and return to Idaho voluntarily. If he chooses not to return voluntarily, Moscow police will initiate extradition proceedings through the governor’s office, Fry said.

“If we do that, it can take a while for him to get here,” he said.

Fellow student says suspect studies criminal justice

According to a news release from Washington State University, Kohberger completed his first semester as a PhD student in the school’s criminal justice program earlier this month.

Elizabeth Chilton, chancellor of the university’s Pullman campus, said the school’s police department assisted Idaho law enforcement officials in the execution of search warrants at Kohberger’s office and his apartment.

A CNN team in Pullman, which is only about 9 miles from the site of the killings, saw law enforcement activity at an apartment complex where graduate students live.

“We also want to extend our deepest sympathies to the families, friends, and Vandal colleagues who were impacted by these murders,” Chilton said. “We will long feel the loss of these young people in the Moscow-Pullman community and hope the announcement today will be a step toward healing.”

In a post removed from Reddit after Kohberger’s arrest was made public, a student investigator associated with a DeSales University study named Bryan Kohberger sought participation in a research project “to understand how emotions and psychological traits influence decision-making when committing a crime.”

“In particular, this study seeks to understand the story behind your most recent criminal offense, with an emphasis on your thoughts and feelings throughout your experience,” the post said. It is unclear who wrote the questions for the survey.

One of the principal investigators of the study, a professor at DeSales University, in Pennsylvania, declined to comment on the matter.

Kohberger graduated in 2020 with a bachelor’s degree, according to a school spokesperson, in June 2022 Kohberger completed his “graduate studies for the Master of Arts in criminal justice program,” the spokesperson said.

The suspect also graduated from Northampton Community College with an associate degree in arts and psychology in 2018, a spokesman for the school in Pennsylvania said.

Case shocked small college town

The November 13 killings riveted the nation and shocked the small college town of Moscow, its first murder in seven years. The case prompted fear and anxiety in the community and student body, and questions mounted about the pace of the police investigation.

Moscow resident Erin Staheli became emotional while expressing her relief at the news of the arrest.

“It’s just been very scary not knowing who’s out there,” Staheli said, noting the fear which has permeated the town of almost 26,000 residents for weeks. “I had doubts that the killer would be caught because it’s been so long, you know.”

Staheli praised the work of the police agencies and FBI for the arrest. “I knew that they would, but it’s just taking so long, and I’m so happy for their families and everybody that’s been worried that all the students, everybody that may not have come back to school,” she said.

The arrest comes a day after police said they have received about 20,000 tips through more than 9,025 emails, 4,575 phone calls, and 6,050 digital media submissions, while having conducted over 300 interviews.

The slain students — Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Madison Mogen, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Kernodle’s boyfriend, Ethan Chapin, 20 — were likely asleep when they were each stabbed multiple times in the early morning hours, authorities have said. Some of the victims had defensive wounds, a coroner has said.

“Today’s news of arrest is a welcome one. It’s relief to our university, our community and our extended Vandal family,” University of Idaho President Scott Green said at the news conference. “The outpouring of support over the past six weeks help sustain us during the most trying time.”

The home where the killings occurred will be cleaned up but remain an active crime scene under police control, authorities said Thursday. Work at the property was halted Friday due to a court order, the police chief said.

Moscow police say they have worked with a property management services company to remove “potential biohazards and other harmful substances used to collect evidence,” the update said. The home will be turned over to the property management company.

The judge said 'no.',"NEW LONDON — A Haitian national convicted by two different juries of murdering 25-year-old Casey Chadwick inside her Norwich apartment in 2015 has for the second time been sentenced to serve a 60-year prison sentence - the maximum allowed by law.

In rendering her sentence on Wednesday, New London Superior Court Judge Shari Murphy said Chadwick’s murder at the hands of Jean Jacques, a 48-year-old man previously convicted of attempted murder in an unrelated case, was a grisly, vicious crime that not only emotionally eviscerated the victim’s family and friends, but also had a “profound” impact on the surrounding community.

“She was murdered at home, where she should have felt the most secure,” Murphy said, calling Jacques’ disregard for human life and failed rehabilitation opportunities a “significant threat to society.”

A jury in June found Jacques guilty of Chadwick’s murder, the culmination of a 10-day re-trial prompted by a state Supreme Court ruling that overturned Jacques’ 2016 conviction for the same crime.

Before the sentencing portion of the proceedings, Murphy rejected a motion by Jacques’ appointed lawyer, Sebastian DeSantis, for a yet another trial.

Senior Assistant State’s Attorney Christa Baker, who prosecuted the case with Assistant State’s Attorney Marissa Goldberg, had pushed for the maximum 60-year sentence, calling the murder a heinous act perpetrated by a man with a proclivity for inflicting violence on women.

Police and mental healthA mental health expert is now embedded with some Conn. police departments. Here's why.

Baker noted Chadwick, whose 110-pound body was discovered in 2015 stuffed into a closet of her Spaulding Street apartment, suffered multiple stab wounds.

Several of Chadwick’s family and friends spoke on Wednesday in front of a large cardboard collage filled with pictures of the smiling Norwich woman, a pictorial presentation that traced Chadwick’s life from infancy to grade-school and into young adulthood.

“You took my best friend,” said Crysta Wydra, addressing Jacques directly. “I’ll never understand in my head and my heart. The devil is real.”

In her written statement, Jamie Arguello said the murder of her friend caused a ripple of destruction that left a trail of “broken hearts” still unmended.

Norwich shooting deathA man was gunned down on a Norwich street in 2020. Why hasn't there been a murder trial?

“The amount of tears Casey’s friends and family have shed, the amount of hours, days, weeks, we have spent in this courtroom, I sincerely hope that this is the last leg of time we have to do this,” she wrote to Murphy. “Let us have the closure. Let us have the ability to finally say that we got justice for Casey.”

Chadwick’s mother, Wendy Hartling, said the only trait she shared with her daughter’s killer was the “reality of living with the eternal presence of absence.”

“It is not our shared humanity, as he has forfeited the right a privilege to be spoken of as a human being,” she said. “He is more of an animal and so be it.”

Hartling called it a “gross miscarriage of justice” and an “epic failure of the justice system” that Jacques was free at the time of her daughter’s death.

“And the fact that Casey and I have to go through this again, seven year later, approaches a level of insanity that is incomprehensible, never mind unimaginable.”

Jacques, who entered the country illegally in the mid-1990s, was previously convicted of attempted murder in connection with the shooting death of a man and the serious injury of a woman in Norwich in 1996. He served 16 years in prison and was released on parole, but not deported.

Prosecutors said Jacques, a known local drug dealer, entered Chadwick’s apartment on the night of June 15, 2015, stabbed her to death and stole a quantity of drugs being stored at the residence by Chadwick’s boyfriend.

A jury found Jacques guilty of Chadwick’s murder in 2016, but the state’s high court later ruled Norwich police conducted an illegal search of Jacques’ Crossway Street apartment where cocaine and Chadwick’s phone was discovered. That evidence was ordered suppressed and the conviction vacated, leading to the new trial this year.

What did Jean Jacques say about Casey Chadwick's death?

During a long, often rambling address to the court on Wednesday, Jacques steadfastly maintained his innocence.

“I don’t know the reason why people think I killed Casey,” he said. “I need justice. I’m good people. I’m not a bad guy.”

DeSantis said his client will appeal the latest conviction.

Baker called Murphy’s sentence a fair one, given the circumstances of the crime.

Outside the courtroom on Wednesday, Chadwick’s step-mother, Wendy Deane-Chadwick, said the sentence means she and her husband, Jeffrey Chadwick, Casey’s father, have the opportunity to “breathe a little easier.”

“It’s over,” she said.

https://news.yahoo.com/senate-races-tightening-across-country-100000060.html,Senate races are tightening across the country in frenzied battle for majority,"The battle for the Senate majority is going down to the wire as a series of races across the country tighten in the days before the election, a process that is alternatively giving hope while also panicking partisans in both parties.

Democrats have their eyes on Wisconsin, where a new poll from CNN found Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) clinging to just a 1-point lead over Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes.

Johnson had been seen as building a more significant lead, and the closeness of the race gave Democrats new hope about their ability to take back a seat from Republicans as they are defending their turf in other states.

In Pennsylvania, Democratic nerves are rattling after an uneven debate performance Tuesday night by Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, whose race against Republican Mehmet Oz has tightened.

If Democrats lose both races, it will greatly injure their prospects of retaining a Senate majority that is now evenly divided between the two parties as they could not afford to lose a single race where they now hold a Senate seat.

Republicans and Democrats alike are also paying close attention to a handful of races that have not been under a bright national spotlight.

In Iowa, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R) has been seen as a heavy favorite to win an eighth term. But Democrats are starting to believe Mike Franken could have a chance at an upset.

The most recent Des Moines Register poll put Grassley, 89, only 3 percentage points ahead of Franken, a retired Navy vice admiral.

In a nod to the urgency to boost Grassley, former President Trump announced that he will headline a rally to support him and Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) on Nov. 3 in Sioux City.

“Voters are deeply skeptical of Grassley and Franken has run an unorthodox campaign that has a lot of Iowans feeling that he’d be a quality replacement. It’s about that simple,” one Democratic strategist involved in Senate races told The Hill, who also noted that Franken is also outspending Grassley on the airwaves this week, a move that reflects the state of play in the state.

Republicans had long seen New Hampshire as a pickup opportunity for their party, but GOP candidate Don Bolduc’s chances seemed dim as Republican money was pulled out of the state.

Now polls show Bolduc closing in on Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), and the Senate GOP has jumped back into the state to give their candidate another boost.

Twists in the days before a midterm are hardly unusual, but this year’s ups and downs have been truly memorable.

While Republican candidates have an economic climate that is bolstering their chances, several backed by former President Trump have had to walk a tightrope to win over independent and moderate voters in states the ex-president lost in the 2020 election.

That and a favorable map has given Democrats a chance of retaining the Senate even as most prognosticators expect them to lose their House majority.

Moods about a single state can be up for a party, than down, then up again.

In Ohio, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) has always been seen as facing an uphill climb in a state that had trended Republican in recent elections. Yet polls over the summer showed him running what many saw as a surprisingly competitive race.

Recent polls have shown Republican J.D. Vance and Ryan in a statistical dead heat.

In Wisconsin, the CNN poll released earlier this week showed Johnson, who had built a several-point lead over the past few months, with a single percentage point advantage over Barnes.

“Do I think it’s going to be close? Yes. Do I think some people may be taking it for granted? Possibly,” one Wisconsin GOP operative told The Hill. “Democrats are outspending Republicans on the airwaves in the final weeks, which is not ideal.”

“Wisconsin elections are always close and this could get a lot closer than many people nationally might expect,” the operative continued, adding that Johnson is not up by 6 percentage points — the margin reported by Marquette Law School’s latest poll.

In New Hampshire, the GOP has put out mixed signals as the Senate Leadership Fund, which is run by allies of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), canceled $5.6 million in ad reservations late last week and redirected those dollars to Pennsylvania to boost Oz. Now the Senate GOP campaign arm is back in New Hampshire spending about $1 million to help out Bolduc, who has been a lackluster fundraiser.

The move came after a pair of public polls showed the race within the margin of error and within striking distance for Republicans.

“It’s a crapshoot. I don’t dispute the polls. … Whoever turns out is going to win. It’s 50-50. It is tight as a tick,” said Dave Carney, a New Hampshire-based GOP strategist. Carney added a lack of third-party candidate on the ballot is one advantage Bolduc has.

In Arizona, another Republican is showing signs of life after a lackluster two-month stretch.

Polling had put Blake Masters well behind Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) but a poll released Wednesday by the progressive group Data for Progress showed the two essentially tied.

Masters’s resurgence could be due in part to Republican nominee Kari Lake, who has opened up a 3-point lead over Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs (D) in the state’s gubernatorial race, with Lake’s coattails helping to bring Masters along.

https://www.agweek.com/news/policy/north-dakota-agriculture-commissioner-says-promoting-livestock-is-a-struggle,North Dakota agriculture commissioner says promoting livestock is a struggle,"North Dakota’s efforts to promote animal agriculture have largely been relegated to helping existing operations expand, in part because of the state’s anti-corporate farming law, North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring said.

North Dakota trails neighboring states, most notably South Dakota, in livestock production. While South Dakota has seen growth, especially in dairy and hogs, North Dakota is struggling to find answers.

“If we weren't doing something, we would do it,” Goehring said. “We've turned every rock over … there's just limitations given the law in North Dakota, as to what we can do.”

North Dakota law forbids corporations from owning agricultural land in the state, a law designed to protect family farms. But modern animal agriculture facilities require significant amounts of capital. While some out-of-state investors are interested in doing business in North Dakota, Goehring says the law shuts them out.

“Until those (laws) change, I don't think animal agriculture, from what I continue to hear from the livestock industry, they don't see it growing or flourishing,” Goehring said. “And in fact, we keep losing even our midsize dairies because it's not economically viable for them.”

When trying to recruit livestock operations, “it was front and center, which is the anti-corporate farming law that prevented them from having a presence in North Dakota.”

The cost, he says, is just too large for a family partnership.

“We knew that animal ag facilities are expensive. We had no idea to the degree, how expensive they were, ranging on some of these facilities from several million dollars to $80 million for a poultry operation that wanted cage-free eggs for the California market,” Goehring said.

He said that price tag was about three years ago, and construction costs have inflated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Goehring said the egg company was interested in North Dakota because of its open spaces and ability to provide a more bio-secure environment than states with a more dense livestock population.

Goehring said his department has been working on what some others in the industry sees as another limiting factor — local ordinances that are more restrictive than what is on the state’s books. He said his department has identified about a dozen counties and close to 30 townships that don’t comply with state law on some details, such as setbacks.

The department is able to review ordinances when someone requests a review and provide that information to the state attorney general’s office.

South Dakota State University Extension swine specialist Bob Thaler said one thing that South Dakota did was survey the state for the best possible sites for livestock operations, based on factors such as roads and access to water and power.

“Do that mapping and then leave it up to the county,” Thaler said. “We want to do it responsibly.”

Goehring, who raises cattle in Burleigh County, said North Dakota has done that “to a degree.” For those looking to grow animal ag, “Tell us the size of operation and we have many locations that probably fit your needs,” he said.

Amber Boeshans is the executive director of the North Dakota Livestock Alliance that in September hosted a day-long conference to try to answer questions and offer solutions about growing animal ag with experts such as Thaler.

Her group doesn’t take a stance on the corporate farm limitations but says North Dakota can attract more animal ag and can learn from South Dakota and other states.

LLEWELLYN, Pa. — These are just a few authentic Native American items in Dave McSurdy's collection.

The man from Minersville has dedicated his career to teaching Native American heritage in Schuylkill county and beyond.

""We should be learning about ways of life that our different than ours because most of the people in the world don't live the way we live. And we have right in our midst a lot of Indians. There's about 3 or 4 million Indians now,"" he said.

McSurdy took Newswatch 16 to a site in Llewellyn, where colonial troops clashed with Native Americans during the French and Indian war in the mid-1700s.

""Not a soldier got injured even. Because they were in the dark and the Indians were reflected by the fire, so the soldiers knew where the Indians were, and that was sort of the end of the Indians,"" he added.

McSurdy is now educating people about Native American culture, traveling to schools, and talking to groups up and down the east coast.

""The kids seem to like it, and that's the important part. Because the more they learn about it, the more they like them,"" he said.

McSurdy says Native American heritage is still alive in Schuylkill County, inspiring the names of many communities and playing a big role in Thanksgiving traditions.

""Thanksgiving is not only a Caucasian occasion but also a Native American because the Native Americans up in that area of Massachusetts brought a lot of the food to that meal,""

Netflix removed the tag in September after it received backlash from viewers.

Murphy defended the tag, saying the series is about a ""gay man"" and his ""gay victims.""

""Dahmer"" creator Ryan Murphy has criticized Netflix for removing the LGBTQ tag from the series after receiving complaints from viewers.

The LGBTQ tag on the streaming platform has been used to highlight series and movies that feature, or are about, LGBTQ characters.

Following its September release, viewers complained that the tag did not seem appropriate for ""Dahmer — Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" due to the nature of the show. The series dramatizes the life of notorious serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who preyed on and targeted predominantly gay men.

A week after the series' release, Deadline reported the tag had been removed.

In a new profile piece in the New York Times, Murphy criticized the backlash and said he spoke to Netflix when they removed the tag.

""I also don't think that all gay stories have to be happy stories,"" the show creator said. ""There was a moment on Netflix where they removed the LGBTQ tag from 'Dahmer,' and I didn't like it and I asked why they did that and they said because people were upset because it was an upsetting story.""

The award-winning writer added: ""I was, like, 'Well, yeah.' But it was a story of a gay man and more importantly, his gay victims.""

Murphy also said he was happy about the sixth episode, which focused on Tony Hughes, a Black deaf man who was killed by Dahmer in 1991.

""There's a five-minute scene of three gay deaf men at a pizza parlor talking in sign language about dating, gay life, and how hard is it for them,"" he said. ""I could not believe that I was getting the gift of putting it on television.""

Last month, Hughes' 85-year-old mother, Shirley, told the Guardian that the episode was inaccurate.

""It didn't happen like that,"" she said. ""I don't see how they can do that. I don't see how they can use our names and put stuff out like that out there.""

Family members of other victims have also criticized the series. Tatiana Banks, the daughter of Errol Lindsey, who was killed by Dahmer in 1991, told Insider that she hasn't been able to sleep since the show was released.

She and her aunt Rita Isbell both told Insider they were not contacted by Netflix.

""I feel like they should have reached out because it's people who are actually still grieving from that situation,"" Banks said. ""That chapter of my life was closed and they reopened it, basically.""

Last week, Murphy said at an event in Los Angeles that he and his team contacted ""20"" of the victims' family and friends during their fact-checking process, but nobody responded to them.

In the New York Times profile, Murphy also hit back at the critics who said the series should not have been made in the first place.

The showrunner said that he wanted the series to shed light on the racism and homophobia in the case.

""It was the biggest thing I've ever seen that really sort of examines how easy it is to get away with things with the white privilege aspects,"" Murphy said. ""What are the rules now? Should we never do a movie about a tyrant?""

has finally been accounted for. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced today that 29 year old Navy Electrician’s Mate 1st Class Edward L. Conway was accounted for on October 1st, 2021.

Conway was assigned to the USS Oklahoma moored at Ford Island in Pearl Harbor when the ship was attacked by Japanese aircraft with torpedoes. The vessel quickly capsized killing 429 of the crew onboard including Conway.

From December 1941 to June 1944, Navy personnel recovered the remains of the crew, which were interred in the Halawa and Nu’uanu Cemeteries in Hawaii.

In September 1947, members of the American Graves Registration Service disinterred the remains of U.S. casualties from the two cemeteries and transferred them to the Central Identification Laboratory at Schofield Barracks. The laboratory staff was only able to confirm the identifications of 35 men from the USS Oklahoma at that time. The AGRS later buried the unidentified remains in 46 plots at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, known as the Punchbowl, in Honolulu.

In October 1949, a military board classified those who could not be identified as non-recoverable, including Conway.

Between June and November 2015, DPAA personnel exhumed the USS Oklahoma Unknowns from the Punchbowl for analysis.

Using dental and antrhopological analysis along with mitochondrial DNA, Conway was able to be identified.

Conway’s name is recorded on the American Battle Monuments Commission’s Courts of the Missing at the Punchbowl, along with the others who are missing from WWII. A rosette will be placed next to his name to indicate he has been accounted for.

According to WAND-TV in Decatur, Conway will be brought home and buried on November 12th in Decatur.",Q4
http://www.thebostonpilot.com/article.php?ID=193876,Aquila: Media claim church teaching helped prompt gay bar shooting is 'lie',"WASHINGTON (CNS) -- Denver Archbishop Samuel J. Aquila called it irresponsible and a ""flat out lie"" for The Denver Post daily newspaper and some other local media to scapegoat Catholic teaching on human sexuality as a reason for hatred against transgender people and the wider LGBTQ community that led to a mass shooting at a Colorado gay bar.



He made the comments in a Dec. 21 interview on the Dan Caplis Show on 630 KHOW, Denver's talk station, about a Dec. 8 op-ed the archbishop wrote for The Wall Street Journal.



Archbishop Aquila was among many religious leaders who immediately condemned the Nov. 19 attack on Club Q in Colorado Springs that left five people dead and injured at least 25 others.



Police arrested the alleged gunman, Anderson Lee Aldrich, 22, after he was subdued by a couple of bar patrons. Aldrich faces 305 charges for first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault charges and many counts of bias-motivated crimes.



""My state witnessed an unmitigated tragedy on Nov. 19 when a gunman opened fire in a gay club in Colorado Springs, killing five and wounding 25,"" Archbishop Aquila wrote in The Wall Street Journal.



""Unfortunately the reaction has thus far fostered more vitriol and division than peace and unity as the press has blamed religious communities including the Catholic Church, to which the shooter has no apparent connection,"" the prelate said.



Advertisement

""'Anti-LBGTQ rhetoric leads to violence,' read the headline of a recent Denver Post report,"" he continued. ""The piece asserted that hateful rhetoric directed toward transgender people and the broader LGBTQ community has been aired from church pulpits to school board debates and libraries.



""It cited the Archdiocese of Denver's school admission guidance on transgender and same-sex attracted students to substantiate its claim. The archdiocese's policy allows schools to discern whether they can admit those who actively live or encourage sexual expression contrary to church teaching.""



He added: ""The New York Times has followed a similar script against the city's evangelical community casting the incident as reminiscent of the faith's long-held opposition to same-sex marriage.""



Focus on the Family, a Christian ministry, is based in Colorado Springs.



Archbishop Aquila told Caplis, a prominent Denver attorney and himself a Catholic, that he wrote the op-ed out of concern for how the daily newspaper and other media were ""portraying the Catholic Church and the teaching of the Catholic Church as if they were contributing to the hatred and the violence committed by the alleged suspect in this case.""



Some days before the shooting, the prelate said, the archdiocese had been in the press ""because of our approach to human sexuality and the understanding of human sexuality from the Catholic point of view that we teach in our Catholic schools and what we promote in our Catholic schools.""



""Citing the guidance that we'd given our schools ... as if that contributed to the violence"" is ""just a flat out lie,"" the archbishop added.



The Denver Post in a Nov. 14 editorial had urged the Colorado High School Activities Association, which helps organize school sports, to expel the Denver archdiocesan high schools over the school admissions guidance.



""Today within society if you have a disagreement with a person or a different worldview than a person,"" Archbishop Aquila said, ""suddenly you're accused of hating the person. ... That was never true even 20 years ago, 25 years ago, 50 years ago, 100 years ago -- when we had differing opinions, differing thoughts, people got along very well and civilly and respectfully.""



The Catholic Church has always taught the Ten Commandments ""very, very clearly,"" he said, adding that ""the Fifth Commandment is: Thou shalt not kill. And that does not need any explanation.""



Everyone is called ""to respect all human life and the dignity of human life, and while we accept everyone where they are at, that does not mean that we affirm their behaviors. And there is a vast difference between accepting and affirming,"" Archbishop Aquila said.



""Showing respect for people, always treating people with respect is something that the church promotes and speaks to,"" he told Caplis. ""There is nowhere in Catholic teaching where we are called to hate another person. In fact, Jesus himself reminds us to 'love one another as I have loved you.' And he reminds us to even go so far as to love our enemies and to pray for those who persecute us.""



For The Denver Post or other media to portray church teaching ""as hate is nothing but ideology and a diminishment of the common good,"" he said.



""We need to return to civility in our society, and I mean very honestly both sides of the aisle are guilty of falling into the trap of vitriol and hatred and speaking words against one another that are not part of a civil society and certainly are not part of the common good,"" Archbishop Aquila added.

Now, they have another tool, this one to help fight overdose deaths.","DENMARK − Overdose deaths in Wisconsin have more than doubled since 2015, with 80% of those deaths caused by opioids last year.

The opioid epidemic has plagued the nation for decades with public health officials, doctors, social workers and community advocates taking on the challenge of preventing overdoses.

Who's next on the frontlines? School nurses.

The Denmark School District is the latest in Brown County to stock up on naloxone, more commonly known by its brand name Narcan — a drug that combats the affects of opioid overdose until further medical attention can be provided.

The district got started stocking naloxone Oct. 25, and Amber Kapinos, the nurse for Denmark schools, will help train staff on how to administer the drug.

""I didn't realize how much of it was in the school system, though, and how important that was (to have naloxone). It's been kind of eye opening to me,"" Kapinos said.

While this is the first time that naloxone is available to Denmark's school nurse and other staff, it isn't the first time the life-saving drug has been in school buildings.

MORE:Brown County school headcounts drop like the rest of the state. Where are students going?

The school resource officer, who is a police officer staffed within the district, has had access to the drug since the Brown County Sheriff's Department started carrying it, dating to at least 2017.

Denmark only has one resource officer who shares his time among four school buildings and sometimes is called outside of the district, Kapinos said. It's the most proactive to have naloxone accessible to more than one person.

""Just like we preventatively house AEDs (automated external defibrillators) and EpiPens, medications like that for emergencies, we felt very strongly that given all that's going on in the world — so the rise with fentanyl overdoses, the increase in vaping and the kind of substances that can be in there without students knowing it — that it would just be a really good thing to dive into,"" she said.

The Unified School District of De Pere started having naloxone available in secured locations in its high, middle and intermediate schools in March.

""We just really wanted to be proactive because obviously student and staff safety is a priority for us, and it's just something that is scary. You read about the effects and the small size of fentanyl that could kill somebody,"" said Nick Joseph, the principal at De Pere High School.

Across the country, districts are stocking naloxone. The Kansas City, Kansas school board and Des Moines Public Schools approved allowing nurses and staff to administer the drug earlier this month.

But the call to have it available isn't new. The National Association of School Nurses has recommended adding naloxone to school emergency preparedness plans since 2015.

MORE:Green Bay-area superintendents have a $182,000 average salary. But here's what else they get.

MORE:'There's so much on the line' for Wisconsin education in November's midterms. Here's what to know.

As a small rural district, Denmark's worry of an ambulance being too late was a key driver in expanding access to naloxone beyond the school resource officer, or SRO.

""Denmark's a rural school district. In the event that the SRO is not here or for some reason we can't find the dose that he has, EMS ... it can take a while for them to get here,"" Kapinos said. ""Sometimes it's really quick. Sometimes it can be 15ish minutes, and we really want to be prepared.""

There haven't been any overdoses or need to use naloxone in the district, according to Kapinos. But being proactive is better than being reactive, she said.

Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid up to 100 times stronger than morphine, is one of main culprits of overdose deaths in Wisconsin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The narcotic drug takes many forms and can be easily mixed with other drugs to increase the potency.

That's why it can be so dangerous to high school students: It's mixed into other substances without them knowing it.

Fentanyl can be pressed into fake prescription pills and mixed into vape cartridges. Nationwide about 14% of high school students use e-cigarettes or vapes.

In Wisconsin, high-schoolers who vape are likely do so illegally since the tobacco purchasing age is 18, raising the risk of getting contaminated vapes.

""We're not seeing it, I would say, as an everyday occurrence here in Green Bay in the schools. However, it is present in the (Green Bay) School District,"" said Green Bay Police Lt. Keith Gering, who's in charge of the School Resource Officer program. ""Fortunately, we haven't had any overdose deaths or overdoses in the schools at this point, up to this point.""

The Howard-Suamico School District and Green Bay Area Public Schools don't have the overdose antidote more widely accessible to school administrators, but their SROs have it available.

The Green Bay School District said in an emailed statement that it's discussing its naloxone protocols, but declined to comment on whether it's expanding access to naloxone beyond school resource officers or the status of its review.

The district sent letters to employees and families Oct. 20 warning about the dangers of fentanyl and the signs of an overdose. The letter to parents encouraged families to have conversations about the risks of drug use, monitor their child's social media and to look out for changes in student behavior.

""What we're seeing in the rise in statistics, I think the more education that we can provide and the more we can encourage families, parents, guardians to talk with students, the better off we're going to be,"" Kapinos said. ""That's all part of that proactive approach is education up front, and unfortunately that probably needs to start earlier than maybe we have done in the past.""

The Ashwaubenon School District's school resource officers have naloxone on hand, and Superintendent Kurt Weyers said the school nurses are working on having it become part of their emergency plan.

In West De Pere, Superintendent Dennis Krueger said the schools don't have it in their buildings but the district's nurse is in the process of getting it.

It’s just as hard to believe the wife, Stacy Peterson, is still alive or will ever be found.

Stacy’s sister, Cassandra Cales, has not given up on searching and even believes she located her remains in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal near Lockport several times over the years, but said she could not convince the cops to recover them from the water.

Stacy’s husband, former Bolingbrook police Sgt. Drew Peterson, claimed at the time of her disappearance that there was no point in looking for her. Peterson, who was 49 when he married a 19-year-old Stacy in October 2003, insisted his wife ran off with another man, possibly to the tropics, abandoning him, their two children and another two from Peterson’s previous marriage.

Drew Peterson In this May 8, 2009 file photo, former Bolingbrook, Ill., police officer Drew Peterson arrives for court in Joliet, Ill.

The reason the mother of those other two children was no longer around was that she turned up drowned in her dry bathtub three and a half years before Stacy disappeared.

This wife, Kathleen Savio, was Peterson’s third. Savio and Peterson were in the midst of a contentious divorce when she died. Photos of the death scene appear somewhat suspicious, as it looks more like her body was jammed into a relatively small bathtub and not as if it came to rest naturally after she slipped and hit her head, which was the prevailing theory among law enforcement.

In fact, the detectives from the Illinois State Police were so convinced from the very beginning that Savio’s death was an accident that they didn’t go to the trouble of conducting much of an investigation, neglecting to dust for fingerprints and failing to collect a single scrap of physical evidence.

Drew Peterson In this courtroom sketch Drew Peterson, right, address the court and Judge Edward Burmila during Peterson's sentencing Thursday at the Will Co…

This proved somewhat problematic for the state police a few years later when Stacy disappeared and people started asking uncomfortable questions about the wife before her and how she died.

By that time, the cul-de-sac outside Peterson’s home was jammed with cable television trucks, reporters and photographers, not to mention those who were simply curious and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Even Geraldo Rivera made an appearance in the cul-de-sac, as did Mark Fuhrman, the former Los Angeles Police Department detective who, by that time, was working for Fox News.

For all the attention paid to Stacy’s disappearance, the authorities were unable to find her, and her husband, whom the state police announced was the sole suspect in her “potential homicide,” has never been charged with harming her.

That said, Peterson hardly skated after Stacy vanished. With the media asking so many questions, the state police turned a fresh eye to Savio’s death. Her body was disinterred and two additional autopsies — one performed by celebrity forensic pathologist Michael Baden on behalf of Fox News — were conducted.

Drew Peterson Trial Photo, flowers and a small angel statue surround the grave marker of Kathleen Savio, the third wife of former Bolingbrook, Ill., police office…

The autopsy performed in the immediate aftermath of Savio’s death found no indication of foul play. Yet somehow, after her body had been in the ground for three and a half years, the new autopsies determined she was the victim of a homicide.

Peterson was eventually charged with murder and taken into custody. He then spent the next three years in the Will County Jail waiting to go to trial.

When he finally got his day in court, things seemed to be going Peterson’s way. Blunders by the prosecution led to motions for mistrials, and an unsettled Will County State’s Attorney Jim Glasgow explained that his struggles were due to illness and fatigue. But then, near the end of the trial, Joel Brodsky, one of the half-dozen attorneys on Peterson’s legal team, decided to put Savio’s divorce attorney on the witness stand, and to say the result was an unmitigated disaster would be putting it mildly.

Soon after, Peterson was found guilty and sentenced to 38 years in prison.

Drew Peterson In this courtroom sketch, Joel Brodsky, left, attorney for Drew Peterson, second from left, look on as Will County State's Attorney James Glas…

All these years later, Peterson’s trying to convince a judge he deserves a new trial. He bases this in large part on Brodsky’s performance as an attorney, claiming he was ineffective.

Fifteen years to the day after Stacy disappeared, Brodsky claimed he was too busy to talk. If he was in fact too busy, it’s not because he was practicing law, as he lost his license some years ago.

In addition to his problems with Brodsky, Peterson’s petition for a new trial mentions a movie that was “played continuously during (his) trial which portrayed him in a very negative light,” blaming it for the guilty verdict.

That movie, “Drew Peterson: Untouchable,” starring Rob Lowe as Drew Peterson and Charlie Koznick as intrepid reporter Joe Hosey, is available for streaming on Amazon for just $12.99 and is totally worth the price, especially if it helped put a wife killer in prison.

And while you’re Amazon shopping, it wouldn’t hurt if you picked up a copy of the book the movie was based on, “Fatal Vows: The Tragic Wives of Sergeant Drew Peterson.”

A sequel to the book and movie might be in order as well, considering Peterson was subsequently found guilty of plotting Glasgow’s murder from behind the walls of an Illinois prison.

Peterson was sentenced to 40 years for the murder for hire scheme, a full two more than he got for actually killing Savio.

The Illinois Department of Corrections also shipped Peterson off to a federal prison here in Indiana, then to a state prison in Indiana.

The Illinois Department of Corrections tried to keep Peterson’s location a secret, but less than a year ago I figured out they were holding him at Indiana State Prison in Michigan City when I got a hold of a letter he wrote to Dateline personality Natalie Morales.

Peterson turns 69 in January, and his scheduled release date is six decades away. He may never face justice for Stacy’s disappearance, but he won’t ever make it out of prison alive either.",Q4

GILMER COUNTY, Ga. — A boyfriend has been accused and faces a murder charge in connection to his 29-year-old girlfriend's death, the Gilmer County Sheriff said Thursday.

The sheriff said Wednesday morning deputies and EMS responded to a reported ""medical emergency"" at a home off of Tails Creek Road in Gilmer County.

When first responders arrived, they saw the injuries of 29-year-old Ashley Peterson and requested detectives from Gilmer County's Criminal Investigation Division to respond. When detectives arrived, they asked for assistance from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.

Peterson was taken to Piedmont Mountainside Medical Center in Ellijay for medical treatment, where she died a short time later, the Gilmer Sheriff said.

During their investigation, detectives found there was a fight between Peterson and her 25-year-old boyfriend, Johnathan Kyle Tatum.

The sheriff's office said the GBI has officially charged Tatum with murder and he's currently being held at the Gilmer County Adult Detention Center.

Randy Halprin, a “Texas Seven” prison gang member, was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Irving police officer Aubrey Hawkins on Dec. 24, 2000. His lawyers have long argued that Judge Vickers Cunningham, who presided over his trial, was biased against him because Halprin is Jewish.

Late Monday, Judge Lela Mays of the 283rd Criminal District Court in Dallas County concluded that Halprin was denied his rights to exercise his religion, due process, and equal protection of the law. Mays recommended that the Court of Criminal Appeals vacate the conviction and death sentence ordered against Halprin.

“In light of all the evidence, this Court finds both that Judge Cunningham harbored actual bias against Applicant because Applicant is a Jew and that Judge Cunningham’s anti-Semitic prejudices created an objectively intolerable risk of bias,” Mays wrote in the ruling

The 45-year-old death row inmate and six others escaped from a maximum security prison in South Texas in December 2000. After breaking out, the escapees went on a robbery spree, including one at a sporting goods store where they shot and killed Hawkins, 29, on Christmas Eve in 2000.

A nationwide manhunt ensued, leading to the capture of six of the men near Colorado Springs, Colorado, in January 2001. The seventh man died by suicide before he could be captured.

All six were charged and convicted of capital murder of a police officer and sentenced to death.

Halprin and Patrick Murphy, who is awaiting execution, are the only living members of the infamous seven escapees. Four have been executed.

Cunningham, who served as a District Court Judge and Dallas County Judge, retired from the bench in 2005 and went into private law practice. He also served as Dallas District Attorney Pro Tem from 2015 to 2016 on the research, investigation, and prosecution of capital murder cases.

In August, witnesses testified that Cunningham expressed anti-Semitic bias while presiding over the 2003 capital murder trial.

Cunningham’s younger brother was among the witnesses who testified that the judge had used racial slurs “almost all the time.”

The Murder of the Officer Hawkins had just finished eating Christmas Eve dinner at a restaurant with his wife, son, mother, and grandmother when he was called to check out suspicious activity at the nearby Oshman’s store. He drove around the parking lot and made his way to a loading dock, where he was met with a “barrage of gunfire,” according to the “As the State has conceded, the contemporaneous statements that Judge Cunningham viewed the Texas 7 co-defendants as ‘the Mexican, the queer, and the Jew,’ and that he vowed to ‘get them all the death penalty,' established that Judge Cunningham harbored actual, subjective bias against [Halprin] at the time of trial because [Halprin] is Jewish,” according to Mays’s ruling.Hawkins had just finished eating Christmas Eve dinner at a restaurant with his wife, son, mother, and grandmother when he was called to check out suspicious activity at the nearby Oshman’s store. He drove around the parking lot and made his way to a loading dock, where he was met with a “barrage of gunfire,” according to the Irving Police

Halprin, who pleaded not guilty, claims he “did not shoot or pull a gun on that night,” according to his personal website , where he posts updates on his case.

The officer had “no time to take evasive or defensive action” when he was fired upon, the police said. “Mortally wounded, Officer Hawkins was pulled from his squad car and run over by the killers.”

Days before Halprin was scheduled for lethal injection on Oct. 19, 2019, he was granted a stay of execution by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.

In April 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up Halprin’s case because state-court proceedings were already underway to address the accusations that religious bias had affected his trial.

“The facts underlying this petition are deeply disturbing,” Justice Sonia Sotomayer wrote in a statement explaining the reasons for the decision ( pdf ).

In October 2021, Mays found that Cunningham violated Halprin’s right to a fair trial. She recommended overturning his death sentence. In May, the appeals court ordered an evidentiary hearing to be held before considering the case.

Mays’s ruling comes after the three-day trial in August. The case will be forwarded to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.",Q4

The family of Rayshard Brooks reached a $1 million dollar settlement with the city of Atlanta, more than two years after police fatally shot the 27-year-old Black man in a Wendy’s parking lot, according to Ryan Julison, a spokesperson for Stewart Miller Simmons Trial Attorneys, the law firm representing Brooks’ family.

“The family of Rayshard Brooks is pleased to have reached a settlement with the city of Atlanta that resolves their civil case. This grieving family has been through so much during this process. Although the children of Mr. Brooks have lost their father, settling the case will undoubtedly assist them with future plans as they come of age,” said attorneys L. Chris Stewart, Justin Miller, Dianna Lee, Brian Spears, Jeff Filipotis and Wingo Smith in a statement following the settlement.

“While we are disappointed that prosecutors didn’t pursue a criminal case against the officers involved in Mr. Brooks’ death, we continue to hold out hope that the Dept. of Justice will intervene in this matter,” the statement continued.

CNN has reached out to the city of Atlanta for comment, but has not yet received a response.

Brooks was killed by Atlanta Police in a Wendy’s parking lot in June 2020 after he fought two officers who tried to arrest him for DUI. During the struggle, Brooks overpowered officers Garrett Rolfe and Devin Brosnan, took a Taser from Brosnan and ran away, according to prosecutors. While fleeing, he turned back and fired the stolen Taser at Rolfe, who then shot Brooks twice — in the back and buttocks — killing him, prosecutors said.

The incident was extensively captured on video, including bodycam footage, Wendy’s surveillance video and witness cellphone video.

The fatal shooting — less than three weeks after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis — sparked protests across Atlanta and beyond amid national demonstrations over police brutality and racial injustice. In Atlanta, the Wendy’s restaurant was set ablaze, hundreds blocked a major interstate, authorities fired tear gas and the police chief stepped down.

Rolfe initially was charged with felony murder, aggravated assault, violations of oath of office and criminal damage to property. Brosnan was charged with aggravated assault and violating his oath.

In August, a Georgia special prosecutor announced the charges were being dismissed against the two officers involved, saying the officers acted reasonably in response to a deadly threat.

https://borneobulletin.com.bn/the-attack-on-speaker-pelosis-husband/,The attack on Speaker Pelosi’s husband,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) – A man broke into United States (US) House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s home in San Francisco, and severely beat her 82-year-old husband, Paul Pelosi, with a hammer last Friday while the Democratic lawmaker was in Washington.

Paul Pelosi had surgery to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands, and his doctors expect a full recovery, the Speaker’s office said. In a letter to congressional colleagues on Saturday night, Nancy Pelosi said her husband’s condition “continues to improve”.

David DePape, 42, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, elder abuse and burglary, police said.

“This was not a random act. This was intentional. And it’s wrong,” San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said.

The violence was the latest jolt to an increasingly splintered political system that is riven with extremism.

A look at what is known about the attack and the suspect:

WHAT HAPPENED?

An intruder wielding a hammer smashed his way through a rear door into the Pelosi residence in San Francisco shortly before 2.30am on Friday.

The man confronted Paul Pelosi and shouted, “Where is Nancy,” according to a person familiar with the situation who was granted anonymity to discuss it.

Paul Pelosi called 911 himself and when police arrived they found him struggling with the assailant. The man managed to strike Pelosi at least once with the hammer before he was tackled by officers and arrested, police said.

Nancy Pelosi was in Washington at the time of the attack.

HOW’S PAUL PELOSI DOING?

He underwent surgery to repair a skull fracture and serious injuries to his right arm and hands, and his doctors expect a full recovery, the Speaker’s office said on Friday. Other than Nancy Pelosi’s letter to colleagues, there were no updates on his condition on Saturday.

Nancy Pelosi arrived in San Francisco late on Friday. The couple has been married since 1963.

In her letter, the Speaker thanked colleagues for their prayers and warm wishes. “Our children, our grandchildren and I are heartbroken and traumatised by the life-threatening attack on our Pop,” she wrote.

“We are grateful for the quick response of law enforcement and emergency services, and for the life-saving medical care he is receiving.”

WHAT ARE INVESTIGATORS SAYING?

Scott, the San Francisco police chief, said the attack was not a random act. “This was intentional,” he said.

Police didn’t immediately confirm a motive, but three people with knowledge of the investigation told The Associated Press that the assailant targetted Pelosi’s home.

The FBI and Capitol Police are also part of the joint investigation.

WHO IS THE SUSPECT?

DePape was expected to be charged next week with attempted homicide, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse and burglary. After his arrest, he was taken to a hospital, where he remained as of Friday evening.

DePape posted frequently on social media, often making racist and rambling comments that included questioning the results of the 2020 election, defending former president Donald Trump and echoing QAnon conspiracy theories.

A two-decade resident of the San Francisco Bay Area, he grew up in Powell River, British Columbia, before following an older girlfriend to California. He has three children with two women.

Stepfather Gene DePape said the suspect had lived with him in Canada until he was 14 and had been a quiet boy.

“He was reclusive,” said Gene DePape. “He was never violent.”",Q4
https://www.theepochtimes.com/judge-reluctantly-pauses-order-striking-down-title-42-border-policy_4867097.html,Judge Pauses Order Striking Down Title 42 Border Policy,"A U.S. judge on Nov. 16 paused his order striking down Title 42, a public health policy that enables U.S. agents to quickly expel some illegal immigrants amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, a Clinton appointee, ruled on Nov. 15 that the policy violated federal law because the agency that promulgated it “failed to adequately consider alternatives.”

Hours later, the Biden administration asked for a five-week stay of the order so that it could transition to a new reality in which it could no longer utilize Title 42 to expel illegal aliens.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) “requires a short period of time to prepare for the transition from Title 42 to Title 8 processing, given the need to resolve resource and logistical issues that it was unable to address in advance without knowing precisely when currently operative August 2021 Title 42 order would end,” government lawyers said in a motion.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention imposed Title 42 during the Trump administration due to the risk of illegal immigrants bringing COVID-19 into the country. The Biden administration narrowed the order, exempting unaccompanied minors, and then tried ending it altogether, but a different judge blocked that effort

Title 8 is a federal law enabling expulsions if illegal immigrants don’t qualify for asylum.

The U.S. Border Patrol expelled some 1 million illegal aliens under Title 42 in fiscal year 2022, versus 1.1 million under Title 8.

Delaying the implementation of the new order, the government said, would enable officials to “move additional resources to the border” and to coordinate with stakeholders to help prepare for its end.

“This transition period is critical to ensuring that DHS can continue to carry out its mission to secure the Nation’s borders and to conduct its border operations in an orderly fashion,” government officials said.

The illegal immigrant plaintiffs who brought the case didn’t oppose the motion.

Sullivan said he would pause his order.

“Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59 and 60, the Court’s inherent authority, and in view of the lack of opposition by Plaintiffs, the government’s representation that the request for a temporary stay is not for the pendency of appeal, but rather to enable the government to make preparations to implement the Court’s Order, the Court, WITH GREAT RELUCTANCE, grants the request,” the judge said.

The ruling moves the end of Title 42 to Dec. 20 from Nov. 15.

The government has given no indication that it will appeal Sullivan’s order striking down Title 42, since it favors ending the policy. Officials have said that the public health policy is being wrongly used as an immigration policy.

The Vera Institute of Justice, which seeks to lower the number of immigrants in detention, was among those welcoming the policy being struck down.

“Title 42 should never have been used to inflict suffering on asylum seekers entering the United States. We need an immigration system grounded in respect and dignity, not punishment and dehumanization,” the group said in a statement.

Organizations that advocate for stronger border enforcement, though, said the ruling was wrong.

“This decision ... knocks down one of the last remaining barriers to complete anarchy at the border,“ Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said in a statement. ”If the Biden administration does not appeal, it will be one of the most egregious derelictions of duty when it comes to border security, once again proving that the crisis is deliberate and something they never intend to fix.”",Q4

https://thesparrow.news/pakistan-continues-to-protect-sajid-mir-despite-his-global-terrorist-mark-report/,Pakistan Continues To Protect Sajid Mir Despite His Global Terrorist Mark: Report – The Sparrow News,"A Geo-Politik blog reports that Pakistan continues to protect Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist Sajid Mir, despite him being recognised as a terrorist by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

“This duplicitous game came to light in July this year when the US found out that Pakistan had approached the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for Mutual Legal Assistance and not the US Department of Justice which had declared Mir as a global terrorist in 2011,” said Geo-Politik.

Sajid Mir, one of India’s most wanted terrorists, is a senior member of the Pakistan-based LeT, and is wanted for his involvement in the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India. A series of coordinated attacks by ten terrorists trained by the LeT were carried out on multiple locations in Mumbai: the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, Oberoi Trident and Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Leopold Cafe, Cama Hospital, Nariman House, Metro Cinema, St. Xavier’s College, near the Times of India building, in a taxi at Vile Parle, and at Mazagaon, in Mumbai’s port area. The attacks killed approximately 170 people, beginning on November 26, 2008, continuing through November 29. According to the FBI website, six Americans were killed during the three-day attack.

According to reports, Mir was one of the primary planners of the attack, and directed preparations and reconnaissance, acting as a controller based in Pakistan. Following the horrific attack, the CIA Station Chief met with ISI Analysis Directorate Major General Akhtar, and presented him with charts and intercepted communications that verified the attack was carried out from Pakistan.

Major General Akhtar disclaimed any involvement in the assault. Pakistani Army chief General Ashfaq Kayani took a similar stance a few days later. Pakistan maintained its denial of involvement in the Mumbai assault during the following years, and, reportedly, even made an effort to conceal Sajid Mir’s name and the circumstances surrounding the incident. Mir was secretly detained in the Punjab province last month, and was later sentenced to 15 years in prison by a Pakistani court. An anti-terrorist court in Lahore convicted Mir, after finding him guilty in a case involving funding of terrorist activities.

In charge of overseeing the LeT’s external activities from 2006 to 2011, as per latest revelations, Mir planned and oversaw a number of terrorist attacks on the organisation’s behalf. In addition, between 2008 and 2009, Mir reportedly planned a terrorist assault on a newspaper publication and its staff in Denmark. Mir was charged in the US, in April 2011, for his involvement in the Mumbai attack. In accordance with Executive Order 13224, as amended, the US Department of the Treasury named Mir as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist on August 30, 2012. This classification has a number of effects, including the blocking of all of Mir’s properties and interests in property that are subject to US jurisdiction, and institution of a general ban on dealings between US citizens and Mir.

The Dawn newspaper reported citing a source that he was also fined PKR 4,20,000, and is serving his sentence in Kot Lakhpat jail. The FATF has removed Pakistan from the terror-financing watchlist as a result of his sentencing. As of now, Pakistan is on the Grey List of the watchdog for not complying with the parameters necessary to combat terrorism.

Meanwhile, China has once again held up a proposal to designate Sajid Mir as a global terrorist at the United Nations, which was introduced by the United States and supported by India. In September, China justified its decision to obstruct the US and India’s joint request at the UN to blacklist Sajid Mir, one of India’s most wanted LeT terrorists who are headquartered in Pakistan, by claiming that its conduct was in accordance with the applicable norms of the UNSC’s anti-terrorism committee. For his involvement in the 26/11 Mumbai terror strikes, the US had a $5 million reward set on Mir’s head.

The US had moved the proposal, and India co-described Mir as a global terrorist under the UN Security Council’s 1267 Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee. After Abdul Rehman Makki, leader of the LeT and Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), and Abdul Rauf Azhar, brother of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar, Beijing has blocked an India-US proposal for the third time in recent months.

https://oakridgetoday.com/2022/11/01/forum-today-about-overturning-of-roe-v-wade/,Forum today about overturning of Roe v Wade,"Four Oak Ridge and Tennessee organizations are having a forum today (Tuesday, November 1) about the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that recognized a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion in 1973.

This summer, almost 50 years later, Roe was overturned by the court in a 5-4 vote.

“The over-turn of Roe v. Wade destroyed 50 years of legal precedentsâ€”and along with the trigger ban law of the state of Tennesseeâ€”placed the health, lives, livelihood, and families of Tennessee women in serious jeopardy,” a press release said. “The physicians and health care providers who have met the needs of these women for decades could now face felony charges. No exceptions are allowed under the law.”

The forum today will feature five female experts, including professors of nursing and medicine, a criminal defense attorney and nonprofit founder, a state senator, and a family nurse practitioner, the press release said.

They will “continue the conversation on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the trigger ban in Tennessee,” the press release said.

The five women are:

Carole Myers

Dr. Carole Myersâ€”moderator.

Myers is a professor in the College of Nursing at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. She teaches graduate level health policy and health services courses.

She is also the creator and co-host of “Health Connections” on WUOT-FM.

She is a fellow of several professional organizations and an avid writer/speaker of health, the press release said.

Chloe Akers

Chloe Akersâ€”panelist.

Akers has served as a criminal defense attorney in both the public and private sector, the press release said.

She is founder and current chair of the board of directors for Standing Together Tennessee. That is a nonprofit legal resource center that was established in response to Tennesseeâ€™s trigger ban on abortion, the press release said.

London Lamar

Senator London Lamarâ€”panelist.

Lamar is a Tennessee state senator from the 33rd senate district (Shelby County) in west Tennessee. She is a Democrat who previously served in the Tennessee House of Representatives.

Her platform includes healthy families. She is particularly interested in providing women of color with quality reproductive health services, the press release said.

Corrine Rovetti

Corinne Rovettiâ€”panelist.

Rovetti is a certified family nurse practitioner, and she practiced at the Knoxville Center for Reproductive Health.

The center is now closed and does not offer any reproductive health services to women in need, the press release said.

Rovetti came to Oak Ridge in 2014 to discuss a state constitutional amendment related to abortion.

Nikki Zite

Dr. Nikki Ziteâ€”panelist.

Zite is a UT professor in obstetrics and gynecology and vice chair of education and advocacy. She specializes in complex family planning, the press release said.

“She, among other physicians and health care providers, is particularly concerned about the no exceptions aspect of the law that is devastating the quality of care for pregnant women and places felony charges on doctors who provide that care,” the release said.

The forum is sponsored by the League of Women Voters of Oak Ridge, American Association of University Women-Oak Ridge, Tennessee Health Care Campaign, and Women’s Interfaith of Oak Ridge.

Part of Lunch with the League, the forum starts online in a Zoom meeting at noon Eastern time.

The press release said the League of Women Voters has studied reproductive health care extensively prior to Roe v. Wade and “has engaged with all significant abortion-related lawsuits and federal legislation since Roe. The League believes that all people should have access to a basic level of quality healthcare at an affordable cost, including abortion, and that public policy must affirm the constitutional right of privacy of the individual to make reproductive choices.”

The forum is open to League members and community members. To access the meeting, use this Zoom link, https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84258578548, or you may send an email to [email protected] for more information.

The forum will also appear on the Leagueâ€™s website at (https://my.lwv.org/tennessee/oak-ridge) a few days after the forum, the press release said.

More information will be added as it becomes available.

https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-12-mrna-vaccine-strategy-fluas-shot.html,An mRNA vaccine strategy under study to fight the flu—as a shot and intranasal spray,"Credit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain

Messenger RNA vaccine technology, once an arcane area of research, became household terminology because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and now scientists are working on an mRNA flu vaccine strategy that, at least in this study, involves a first dose administered as a shot but a booster administered as an mRNA nasal spray.

The vaccine is known as a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine that targets influenza's viral nucleoprotein. That structure in influenza A viruses is a highly conserved multi-functional protein and is a key target in vaccine and antiviral research because it is less likely to mutate compared with viral surface proteins.

The strategy devised by researchers, primarily at the University of Minnesota who are working with collaborators elsewhere in the United States, was to generate lung-resident memory T cells that are stably maintained in respiratory tissues.

So far, the research is underway in animal models but the hope is to craft a vaccine—and method of vaccine administration—that helps conquer one of humankind's most persistent foes: the flu.

Each year in the United States, an estimated 36,000 deaths and millions of hospitalizations are due to influenza-related illness. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates 250,000 to 500,000 flu deaths annually. And in the case of influenza pandemics, the viral infection causes even more catastrophic damage as was the case in 1918 when an estimated 500 million people, about one-third of the world's population, became infected with the virus and 50 million died.

The goal in the Minnesota-based research was an mRNA flu vaccine strategy that prompts resident memory T cells to fan out in the lungs and to be prepared in the event of infection.

""Respiratory tract resident memory T cells, typically generated by local vaccination or infection, can accelerate control of pulmonary infections that evade neutralizing antibody,"" writes Dr. Marco Künzli of the Center for Immunology in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Minnesota.

""It is unknown,"" Künzli added, ""whether mRNA vaccination establishes respiratory resident memory T cells.""

As the lead author of the study, which was published in Science Immunology, Künzli and a large team of scientists, wanted to know if they could do just that—help establish respiratory resident memory T cells in the lungs of animal models via mRNA vaccine technology.

The strategy they devised for the research—which worked—involved an initial prime and boost with intramuscular vaccination followed by a secondary intranasal booster. This strategy efficiently promoted memory CD4 and CD8 T cells in lung tissue. Beyond the current research, the findings help highlight how mRNA vaccine technology can be adapted to protect the lungs from any respiratory infection, for example, such as RSV—respiratory syncytial virus—or beyond RSV, any other pathogen from a vast swath respiratory infectious agents.

While intramuscular prime and boost immunizations were sufficient to induce respiratory resident memory T cells in the animal models, an additional intranasal boost further expanded both circulating and lung resident memory T cells, the researchers found.

""We generated a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine encoding the influenza A virus nucleoprotein,"" Künzli continued, noting the nucleoprotein ""is encapsulated in modified dendron–based nanoparticles.""

""We report how routes of immunization in mice, including contralateral versus ipsilateral intramuscular boosts, or intravenous and intranasal routes, influenced influenza-specific cell-mediated and humoral immunity,"" Künzli asserted.

Scientists left no stone unturned in their research. After the multi-pronged administration strategy, they checked the respiratory resident memory T cells' functions in the mice through parabiosis, a surgical protocol commonly used in immunological studies involving the respiratory resident memory T cell subpopulation.

Initial analysis demonstrated that respiratory resident memory T cells insinuated themselves in lung tissue becoming long-term residents after the prime-boost intramuscular administration. The intranasal booster, which further increased the number of respiratory resident memory T cells, helped establish memory CD4 and CD8 T cells, circulating and residing in the lungs.

The new research, which shows potential for new ways to administer an mRNA to achieve an immunological goal, arrives following the success of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

Scientists are also moving ahead with research on mRNA vaccines for a large number of diverse medical disorders, including various forms of cancer, rare diseases, and yes, numerous infectious diseases. The new influenza research underscores that mRNA technology is not only robust but capable of being explored as a highly tailored weapon against the flu.

""The prospects are exciting for combating emerging pathogens, antigenically variable pathogens that might be addressed by megavalent vaccination, and perhaps non-infection conditions such as personalized tumor vaccines,"" Künzli noted.

https://news.webindia123.com/news/Articles/World/20221216/4015646.html,Pakistan's most crucial challenges include impacts of climate change: Report,"Amid one of the most cataclysmic floods in the history of Pakistan, the country's most crucial challenges include the impacts of climate change, writes Arshia Malik, a columnist and an educationist in South-South Research Initiative (SSRI). The most crucial challenges for Pakistan include the impacts of climate change -- floods, heat waves, drought, crop losses and diseases -- whose frequency has increased rapidly over the past couple of decades. Pakistan has serious environmental issues and the World Bank report in 2013 expressed serious concerns, stating that Pakistan's top environmental problems include air pollution, inadequate supply of potable water, noise pollution and the health deterioration of urban and rural populations due to pollution, reported SSRI. These environmental concerns not only harm Pakistani citizens but also seriously threaten the country's economy, said Malik. In 1997, the government of Pakistan enacted the 'Pakistan Environmental Protection' Act to safeguard, conserve, rehabilitate and improve the environment of the country through sustainable development measures, such as pollution control. But have Pakistan been able to steer towards a sustainable and green economy in the 21st century? questioned Malik. The Environmental Performance Index (EPI) is an International ranking body that ranks countries on their environmental health and sustainability. It was started in 2002 by World Economic Forum and ranks 180 countries on climate change performance, environmental health, and ecosystem vitality. These indicators provide a gauge at a national scale of how close those countries are progressing to achieving established environmental policy targets. Experts on Pakistan's environmental concerns say that degradation of natural resources, soil erosion, deforestation, unbridled and unplanned urbanization and contamination of groundwater resources are some of the significant and serious issues that need immediate attention from the government of Pakistan and addressing them, reported SSRI. The country is facing acute water scarcity, with experts saying the country could run out of water by 2040 if the concerned authorities don't take long-term measures to deal with the issues. Researchers predict that Pakistan is on its way to becoming the most water-stressed country in the region. Also, Although, the government has launched multiple tree plantation drives in Pakistan over the past few years to overcome this problem, for example, the 'One Billion Trees' initiative undertaken by the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is also a noteworthy achievement to address this all-important shortcoming. Similarly, the 'Karachi Cleanliness Drive', is another glaring example of how Pakistan should take tangible steps to deal with its environmental issues, reported Malik. Noise pollution is another serious threat the environmental conservation efforts are battling with. Pressure horns and factories cause noise pollution. Noise pollution can lead to psychological complications, thus disrupting social relationships. Again, the issue is with non-implementation and compliance with the laws of the country. All provincial and federal governments in Pakistan have banned the use of plastic bags, but citizens do not seem to adhere to the laws. The release of toxic gases from factories, brick kilns and carbon emissions from transport vehicles are the prime causes of air pollution. Another important environmental issue that threatens Pakistan is waste management. The country's factories and hospitals dispose thousands of tons of their waste into the oceans, lakes and rivers, which are life-threatening for aquatic and human life who are dependent on these water resources. Similarly, lack of proper mechanisms, allocated landfill sites and negligence by local municipal corporations and the public are the main cause of waste dumped openly on roads and streets of Pakistan, reported SSRI. Pakistan needs a green economic model. It should scrap all big hydropower and coal-power projects and switch to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, which are viable for developing countries in the long run. (ANI)",Q4
https://www.foxnews.com/media/elon-musk-cheers-woke-journalist-migration-twitter-judgy-hall-monitors-stay-platforms,Elon Musk cheers woke journalist migration from Twitter: ‘Judgy hall monitors stay on other platforms’,"Mastodon, a social media alternative to Twitter, has reportedly become the source of woke infighting and journalistic ""gatekeeping,"" much to the amusement of media critics and Twitter CEO Elon Musk himself.

After Musk began enacting new policies on the site, including reinstating banned accounts such as former President Trump, several prominent people announced they would be moving to Mastodon in protest. As more journalists moved onto the site, however, there were more reports of blocking, attacking and outright banning of users over political issues.

In one case, former Slate podcaster Mike Pesca was suspended from the popular Mastodon ""instance,"" or server, for verified journalists called journa.host after linking to the New York Times story on the negative consequences of puberty blockers on children. Transgender blogger Parker Malloy attacked Pesca and complained that the ""anti-trans content"" was not removed from the network. According to the New York Times, Pesca was soon informed that, ""he had been suspended for referring to Ms. Molloy as an 'activist,' which was dismissive.""

ELON MUSK MOCKS MEDIA CLAIMING NEUTRALITY AFTER TAKEOVER FREAKOUT: ‘WILL HAVE TO FACT-CHECK THAT’

""I had to join Mastodon to get called a bigot by @ParkerMolloy because I said a well reported NYT article complicated a common claim around puberty blockers. Seems a huge difference from Twitter,"" Pesca tweeted on Saturday.

Malloy was subsequently suspended from journa.host for calling transgender journalist Evan Urquhart a ""bootlicker.""

With several similar stories of self-proclaimed moderators making arbitrary decisions, Twitter users have been joking that Mastodon has become a den for ""hall-monitor"" journalists.

""Among the many irritating things about Mastodon is that it enables status-chasing journalists to gatekeep their peers by judging whether they have enough clout or are useful to other people's career ladder-climbing,"" digital media consultant Heidi N. Moore tweeted Sunday about an article on journa.host.

FiveThirtyEight founder Nate Silver replied, ""Mastodon seems like a honeytrap for hall-monitor personality types. Honestly if Elon gets all the hall monitors to migrate to Mastodon that might be his greatest contribution toward the betterment of humanity.""

Musk himself responded to Silver’s post tweeting, ""What could be more fun than a social network consisting entirely of hall monitors!?""

In a separate tweet, he wrote, ""Hope all judgy hall monitors stay on other platforms – please, I’m begging u.""

""Mastodon is the woke lib journo circular firing squad hell pit they always wanted Twitter to be,"" Twitter user Comfortably Smug joked.

Journalist Glenn Greenwald tweeted, ""Over on Mastodon - the obscure refuge to which liberal journalists are fleeing in fear of free speech even though they can't figure it out - they're already banning each other over the most trivial infractions. It's like a laboratory to study how censorship-happy rats behave.""

""Shocked to see the kinder, gentler twitter is equally full of drama,"" Blocked and Reported podcast's Katie Herzog tweeted, while her co-host Jesse Singal said, ""[T]his meltdown really just reinforces all my preexisting views about this entire censorious crew. Let them have their dumb Mastodon instance so they'll leave the rest of us alone.""

""Mastodon is already a [colossal] failure, with all the wokes reporting and suspending each other,"" researcher Eli David wrote.

""Mastodon is hell. And it’s a hell in which every moderator can read your DMs and if they deem you to be talking behind their backs you will get banned. It’s the inverse of Twitter, where people can publicly make fun of @elonmusk and not get banned for it,"" journalist Ian Miles Cheong declared.

ELON MUSK POKES FUN AT CBS’ SHORT-LIVED TWITTER HIATUS AFTER NETWORK RESUMES TWEETING LESS THAN 48 HOURS LATER

https://townhall.com/tipsheet/madelineleesman/2022/11/14/supreme-court-rejects-bump-stock-ban-case-n2615931,Supreme Court Rejects Bump Stock Ban Case,"On Monday, the United States Supreme Court rejected a challenge to a federal ban on devices known as “bump stocks” that enable semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns, according to a report from Reuters.

The Supreme Court justices reportedly declined to review an appeal by a group of firearm dealers and individuals after a lower court rejected their argument that the bump stock ban violated the U.S. Constitution. The ban was first instituted during President Donald Trump’s term (via Reuters):

Trump's administration moved to reclassify bump stocks as machine guns, which are forbidden under U.S. law, in a rare firearms control measure prompted by a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas. The Supreme Court in 2019 declined to block the ban from going into effect. The justices last month rejected appeals by a Utah gun lobbyist and firearms rights groups of lower court rulings upholding the ban as a reasonable interpretation of a federal law prohibiting machine gun possession. Bump stocks use a gun's recoil to bump its trigger, enabling a semiautomatic weapon to fire hundreds of rounds per minute to let it shoot like a machine gun. Trump pledged to ban them after a gunman used semiautomatic weapons outfitted with bump stocks in a shooting spree that killed 58 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas.

The Seattle Times noted that the Supreme Court rejected two other challenges involving the ban last month.

Over the summer, the Supreme Court justices struck down a New York gun law that required permit applicants to show “proper cause” for wanting to carry a firearm. Since then, lower courts have protected Second Amendment rights and cited the Court’s case that invalidated New York’s gun law.

Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion in the case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, pointing out that the right to bear arms should not be subject to a different set of rules apart from the other rights detailed in the Bill of Rights:

The constitutional right to bear arms in public for self defense is not “a second-class right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees.” We know of no other constitutional right that an individual may exercise only after demonstrating to government officers some special need. That is not how the First Amendment works when it comes to unpopular speech or the free exercise of religion. It is not how the Sixth Amendment works when it comes to a defendant’s right to confront the witnesses against him. And it is not how the Second Amendment works when it comes to public carry for self defense. New York’s proper-cause requirement violates the Fourteenth Amendment in that it prevents law-abiding citizens with ordinary self-defense needs from exercising their right to keep and bear arms. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

After the ruling, a federal judge in Syracuse struck down key parts of a restrictive New York gun law that took effect in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling. The law restricted who could carry a handgun in public, where handguns could be carried and where firearms could be purchased. The law explicitly prohibited guns in places deemed as ""sensitive locations.""",Q4

In a press release on Thursday, Governor Kathy Hochul announced that she had signed the legislation to ban the sale of dogs, cats, and rabbits at retail pet stores, which will take effect in 2024. The goal of the legislation is to end the puppy mill pipeline, a system that frequently mistreats animals in the name of profit.

For those who may not be familiar with puppy mills, it's a term used to describe commercial animal breeders who breed animals for profit, and often leave animals in substandard conditions. Having worked at an animal shelter in my younger years, I've seen firsthand that the animals, especially the older animals, that are rescued from puppy mill operations require a great deal of extra care and attention, and often act fearfully or aggressively towards people.

""Dogs, cats and rabbits across New York deserve loving homes and humane treatment,"" said Governor Hochul. ""I'm proud to sign this legislation, which will make meaningful steps to cut down on harsh treatment and protect the welfare of animals across the state.""

Under the legislation, pet stores will be allowed to charge animal shelters rent to use their space for adoptions.

According to a report by Maysoon Khan for the associated press, Pets stores have argued that the law does nothing to shut down out-of-state breeders or increase their standard of care for the animals they breed. They also say that despite the intent of the bill to shut down the puppy mill pipeline, it will be pet stores that have to pay the price and dozens could close across New York State.

https://www.counterpunch.org/2022/11/18/young-voters-delivered-big-wins-for-abortion-rights/,Young Voters Delivered Big Wins for Abortion Rights,"When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this summer, it unleashed a wave of cruel new restrictions on reproductive freedom. But shredding a half-century-old constitutional right also unleashed another wave: voters.

The “red wave” Republicans expected in this year’s midterms fell far short as younger generations mobilized to protect their reproductive rights from anti-abortion extremists. The dust is still settling on the results, but abortion proved a key factor in boosting turnout among Democratic-leaning voters in the battle for Congress, state legislatures, and gubernatorial races.

In exit polls, for example, 44 percent of young voters named abortion rights as their top concern, and the vast majority of these voted for Democratic candidates. These voters played a big role in shaping the next Congress and helped deny Republicans control of the Senate.

And they may have played an even bigger role in the states, which are now on the front lines in the battle for bodily autonomy.

The first to foreshadow the high youth turnout we saw in the midterms was Kansas, a traditionally conservative state. This summer, 59 percent of Kansas voters voted against a constitutional amendment that would have banned abortion rights in the state.

Again and again, we saw similar results in this year’s midterms. In ballot initiatives in six states, abortion rights supporters won big.

Voters in California, Michigan, and Vermont voted to enshrine abortion access in their state constitutions, setting an example for other states to follow. In Kentucky, 52 percent of voters struck down an amendment that would have put an abortion ban in the state constitution. And in Montana, another 52 percent of voters opposed a “born-alive” measure that could have subjected abortion providers to criminal penalties.

Young voters also helped Democrats capture statehouse chambers in Michigan and Minnesota, and put them on the cusp of flipping one in Pennsylvania. In my own state, New Mexico, Democrats swept to victory across the board.

New Mexicans currently have full access to abortion, making the state a destination for people seeking abortions from Oklahoma and Texas. Yet abortion access isn’t officially codified in state law. In the upcoming 2023 legislative session, Democratic lawmakers plan on introducing a measure to do just that following the reelection of Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham.

Abortion rights weren’t the only measures on the ballot. A stunning 70 percent of New Mexican voters enshrined a right to early childhood education in their state constitution. Voters in other states raised minimum wages, expanded Medicaid, legalized marijuana, and more. But there’s no denying that abortion rights brought together younger generations to vote in masses seldom seen before.

There is still a lot of work to be done — at least 22 million people of reproductive age still live in 15 states with complete abortion bans. But lawmakers of both parties should take note: Young people will resist radical efforts to violate our reproductive freedoms and our futures.",Q4

Esson was sentenced for attempted murder, in the second degree, for a daytime stabbing in the City of Newburgh.

On July 9, 2021, Esson drove his taxi by a man who was near the back of the taxi near the victim's fiancée and two children.

Officials allege Esson was pursuing the woman and stalked her for a period of time leading up to July 9.

Esson fled the scene but was arrested later that day in possession of the knife he used in the attack, officials.

After his arrest, Esson made statements to the police that indicated his intent was to kill the victim, according to the Orange County District Attorney's Office.

https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-violence-boston-athol-3a0207cda7701360a8ad36c3e8da4681,Renowned painter’s son convicted in Jan. 6 attack on Capitol,"BOSTON (AP) — The son of a renowned American painter was convicted Friday of four counts of participating in the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.

Vincent Gillespie, 61, of Athol, Massachusetts, was found guilty of assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers; civil disorder; engaging in physical violence in a restricted building or grounds; and an act of physical violence in the Capitol grounds or buildings, prosecutors said.

Sentencing is scheduled for March 17.

Investigators said Gillespie pushed, yelled at and fought with police, maneuvering to a line of officers defending the Lower West Terrace’s exterior door. At one point, Gillespie took control of a police shield and used it to ram officers, they said.

He grabbed a Metropolitan Police Department sergeant by the arm, yanking him toward the mob and screamed “traitor” and “treason,” according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

A lawyer representing Gillespie did not immediately return a request for comment.

A video interview Gillespie conducted with The Associated Press at the time of the riot was used as evidence by prosecutors during the trial, along with security video from the Capitol and police body cameras.

Although he was quick to give his name when asked by the AP reporter on the scene interviewing him, Gillespie hesitated before saying where he was from. “They’ll come after me, man,” he said, hesitating before adding, “I’m in Massachusetts.”

Vincent Gillespie is the son of renowned postwar American artist Gregory Gillespie, whose self-portraits, fantasy landscapes and geometric abstractions are included in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and other museums. Gregory Gillespie died in 2000.

The AP video captured a flushed Vincent Gillespie milling about outside the Capitol speaking defiantly about his role in the attack — and his lament that more like-minded individuals didn’t join the fight.

“We were almost overpowering them,” Gillespie, blood visible on his scalp from the clash, told an AP journalist. “If you had like another 15, 20 guys behind us pushing I think we could have won it.”

The trial began Monday with jurors beginning deliberations on Thursday and concluding on Friday. At trial. Gillespie testified in his defense.

“He testified about finding the events of Jan. 6 fun and enjoyable,” said jury forewoman Niki Christoff, 44, of Washington, D.C. “By testifying in his own defense, I think he tried to muddy the waters and that only added to jury deliberation time.”

Christoff cited what she described as overwhelming photographic and video evidence against Gillespie.

Gillespie was spotted by AP outside the Capitol pouring water into his eyes, apparently to combat the effects of chemical spray.

He said he was among those attempting to storm the building by bursting through an opening.

“I was with some other guys. And then we were starting to push against them and they were beating us and putting that pepper spray stuff in your eyes. But there were a bunch of people pushing behind us,” Gillespie told The AP.

“What you guys need to know, and no one is going to listen to this, we were very (expletive) close.” If more people had been behind him, he said, “then there’s that second set of doors we would have just burst through it.”

He added on the video that he hoped those attacking the building “would flood in so there’s nothing they can do.

“That’s what I would hope they would do. Take it over. Take it over. Own it for a few days. I’m not an anarchist, but you can’t let stand what happened in this election,” he said in an apparent reference to former President Donald Trump’s false claims the election was stolen.

Investigators said they were tipped off to Gillespie’s identity by a former neighbor and others including employees of the town of Athol, where Gillespie attends meetings and pays his tax bills at the town hall. In all, authorities said, six witnesses independently identified him from images taken from the riot.

Gillespie is one of nearly 900 people arrested in nearly all 50 states in connection with the Capitol assault in which the pro-Trump mob sought to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory, officials said.",Q4

Till, a 14-year-old African-American boy, was abducted, tortured and killed in Mississippi in 1955 for allegedly whistling at a white woman. The film is told from the perspective of his mother Mamie Till-Mobley and focuses on the extraordinary decisions she made in the aftermath of his brutal lynching.

During a recent post-screening Q&A in London, producers Goldberg and Broccoli explained they never considered telling the film in another way.

""(Telling it from her perspective) was essential and that was something that Whoopi and I felt very strongly about. We felt it was essentially a love story between a mother and a son,"" Broccoli explained.

After seeing Chinonye Chukwu's 2019 film Clemency, the producers approached her about directing Till and she felt the exact same way about the perspective.

""She said it has to be from Mamie's point of view, it's a love story between a mother and a son, and she was adamant not to show the violence, only the aftermath. We were just so thrilled because we felt that we all totally agreed with her,"" Broccoli continued.

When asked why they chose not to show what happened to Till, Goldberg insisted it was not necessary.

""You don't need to see it. Nobody needed to see it. We know what it looks like and we know what it sounds like. We didn't give you a whole long sound of it, we let you know it was happening. Because what was important in this movie is what she does with what was done to her child,"" the Sister Act star said.

Broccoli added that she wants the film to be a tribute to Till-Mobley, who died in 2003, and hopes the project will help people know more about her both as a person and a prominent figure in the civil rights movement.

Till stars Danielle Deadwyler as Till-Mobley alongside Goldberg as her mother Alma. It is released in U.K. cinemas on 6 January.",Q4

Eric Swalwell (D-Fang Fang) on Monday unveiled a demagogic new campaign video that is designed to heighten Leftist hysteria about the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the prospect of some states outlawing abortion. Swalwell captioned the video: “MAGA Republicans want women arrested for having an abortion. This is what that looks like. #LockHerUp”

This plays into the Left’s most paranoid fantasies about the “radical right” and the rise of “fascism,” but as Daily Signal reporter Mary Margaret Olohan pointed out, “This has never happened. But this is what it looks like when the Biden DOJ shows up at the home of a pro-life activist and arrests him in front of his screaming children. That has happened multiple times now.” Exactly. The Swalwell abortion appeal is the exact obverse of what’s really happening in America today and ignores the real source of contemporary fascism: Swalwell and his colleagues.

MAGA Republicans want women arrested for having an abortion. This is what that looks like. #LockHerUp pic.twitter.com/YUD0swW8DE — Eric Swalwell (@ericswalwell) October 18, 2022

Swalwell’s video is the very definition of psychological manipulation. It begins with a father feeding a baby at the dinner table as a piano meanders sentimentally in the background. As Dad makes num-num-num sounds to encourage the happy baby to eat, the baby’s older sister, who looks to be about eight, says exasperatedly, “You’re weird.” Mom, brimming with affection, agrees happily: “He is weird. But cute.” Husband looks up from his baby-feeding duties, says, “Awww,” and the couple kisses, as the girl, clearly pleased and fascinated, keeps up her act by exclaiming, “Gross!”

Subtext: women who have had abortions are as American as apple pie, benign, normal, un-green-haired, un-tattooed, un-enraged, un-screaming, un-hateful. Why, they’re just like you and me, or rather, just like Ozzie and Harriet: benign, loving, kind, and above all, family-oriented. All those morbidly obese women with hair dyed unnatural colors and obscene slogans on their t-shirts? Forget ’em. The true face of abortion is just like your face.

This is, in other words, pure propaganda, and it gets worse. For at that moment, this idyllic scene is interrupted by blue-and-red flashing lights shining through the curtains and loud, insistent knocks on the door. Hubby asks, “What the hell?” which is a bit out of sync with the Father-Knows-Best vibe, but after all, it is a crisis moment. Wife opens the door to reveal two solemn cops, who might as well be holding “Defund the Police” signs.

One of them says: “Mary Anderson? I have a warrant for your arrest.” Stunned and baffled hubby asks: “Arrest for what?” Po-faced cop continues: “Penal Code 243 violation: unlawful termination of a pregnancy.” Husband recoils: “You gotta be kidding me!” Wife stammers: “That is, that is my personal business.” The officer says: “That’s for the courts to decide, ma’am. Your medical records have been subpoenaed, and Dr. Lander’s already in custody.” As she says, “You can’t just—” the cop continues unperturbed: “You will have to submit to a physical examination.”

At that point, all hell breaks loose. Husband steps toward the cops, saying, “No one’s touching my wife!” They draw their guns and order him to get back. The kids scream in terror as the cops order the woman to turn around and put her hands behind her back. “We’re just enforcing the law here,” says the cop, as the screen goes black and we see, “Elections Have Consequences” and an appeal to voters to save the sacrifices to Moloch. We see one last glimpse of the woman in the back of the police car, muttering “Please don’t do this.”

It’s terrifying, all right. But it’s utter fiction. As Olohan noted, this has never happened. What’s more, not one Republican or major pro-life advocate has called for the arrest of women who get abortions. What has happened quite recently, however, is that Old Joe Biden’s appallingly corrupt FBI arrested pro-life activist Mark Houck in a scenario that was quite a bit more terrifying than the one imagined in Swalwell’s video.

As PJM’s Paula Bolyard reported, the feds carried out “a SWAT raid on the family home at 7:05 a.m. According to [Houck’s wife] Ryan-Marie’s account, there were 25-30 agents in 15 cars. They surrounded the house with rifles in firing position, and ‘started pounding on the door and yelling for us to open it.’” Houck’s children were screaming in terror, just like in Swalwell’s video, but for real.

And just to emphasize that the action against Houck wasn’t a one-off, the following week, the FBI carried out a similar raid at the home of a 73-year-old pro-life activist, Chester Gallagher. If Eric Swalwell is worried about federal overreach, he must have denounced the raids on Houck and Gallagher, no? Of course, he didn’t. His concern is only that the Left’s agenda be advanced, including its maniacal support for abortion without any restrictions. His concern for unjustifiable law enforcement raids on peaceful, loving families ends where that Leftist agenda begins.",Q4

MORE: When is early voting in Texas? 2022 midterm election dates, where to vote

During the March primaries, incumbent Lina Hidalgo took a huge lead as the Democratic nominee, but the race seems neck-and-neck against Republican Alexandra del Moral Mealer.

This is due to Hidalgo facing scrutiny over allegations of not doing enough to combat a rise in crime and an ongoing lawsuit over an $11 million COVID-19 outreach contract. FOX 26 recently learned that very contract, after obtaining financial documents, appeared to be used for political-mining purposes.

MORE: Harris Co. Judge Lina Hidalgo COVID outreach campaign allegedly never returned money

FOX 26 contributor Bill King, who obtained the documents from the Harris County Auditor, noted something of particular interest in the invoices from three highly focused software companies.

""All of them were Democratic campaign operations,"" King said back in late October. ""They were all companies that specialize, that provide data services to Democratic campaigns that obviously has nothing to do with COVID. All of them brag about what a great job they did identifying Democratic voters and getting them to the polls.""

Simultaneously, Mealer has been hammering away at Hidalgo on the crucial issue of crime control. This comes on the heels of a budget agreement for 2023 that failed to occur due to two county commissioners refusing to attend the hearings.

RELATED: Harris Co. Commissioners Cagle, Ramsey boycott 2023 budget vote

Hidalgo claimed the additional money was necessary to fund pay raises and to expand health care in Harris County and law enforcement programs. The plan was meant to give law enforcement officers an 8.25% raise, but due to their absences, that won't happen, and other cuts would have to be made.

""What has happened now that they refused to show up is that we have now defaulted to an even lower tax rate, which means we don't have the revenue we need to maintain basic services,"" she said. ""There simply isn't money for that. We were going to give you an 8.25% raise. Now, it's going to be 4%. We will no longer have an additional 35 investigators or an additional cadet class for the sheriff's office. We're cutting money to the tune of $60 million for the sheriff, $5 million for the DA, and for the constables, I think it's around $11 million.""

Mealer has certainly capitalized on these issues surrounding Hidalgo, and earned her strong endorsements such as Jim ""Mattress Mack"" McIngvale and the Houston Chronicle.

However, even a recent political attack ad against Hidalgo by Mealer's campaign team arguably went too far in its statements about the incumbent's legal trouble.

""Hidalgo faces criminal indictment for rigging an $11 million contract for insiders,"" declares the narrator in the advertisement.

This is because, as FOX 26's Senior Legal Analyst Chris Tritico pointed out in a previous report, it erroneously predicts the lawsuits outcome.

""Lina Hidalgo is not indicted, is not charged,"" he said. ""We have no idea if she is going to be indicted. That part of the ad I have big problems with. I think that is a misleading statement and I don't think it should be used in an ad.""

Allies of Hidalgo, on the other hand, argue she has demonstrated merit-worthy practices during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2021 Winter Storm.

RELATED: Harris County Judge forum held without incumbent candidate | Race for County Judge perhaps not a ""sure thing"" for incumbent - What's Your Point?

According to the Texas Tribune, her response to several natural disasters made her one of the state's most recognizable Democrats. And her public clashing with state authorities, who seemed to challenge her every move, show that she was doing what she could with what she had.

""She and other urban county judges enacted measures intended to slow the spread of the virus like mask mandates and occupancy restrictions in stores and restaurants — drawing the ire of conservatives,"" Joshua Fletcher with the Texas Tribune writes. ""Early in the pandemic, Hidalgo publicly clashed with Gov. Greg Abbott when he took the authority to enact pandemic restrictions away from local officials, unsuccessfully pleading with Abbott to take stronger action as COVID patients overwhelmed many Houston hospitals. Hidalgo also oversaw the county’s response to the 2021 winter storm that crashed the state’s power grid, as well as the region’s ongoing recovery from Hurricane Harvey.""

Despite this, crime looks to be the key issue voters are looking for, which Mealer seems to be the placing a majority of her campaign's focus.

""What I take away is, this is absolute lawlessness and how do you have that in a county that's roughly 30 percent of the state's GDP?"" Mealer said during a forum with the Houston Super Neighborhoods Alliance, which Hidalgo did not attend.

RELATED: Crime continues to be concern for voters amid race for Harris County judge

And while Hidalgo has touted that crime has gone down in Harris County, FOX 26 recently learned there might be more to the numbers than previously reported and serious questions are being asked, especially after the Sheriff's Office reported zero murders, rapes, and robberies in September.

In fact, it was crime that ultimately led the Houston Chronicle to endorse Mealer over Hidalgo, which the editorial board admitted was not an easy decision. A West Point and Harvard Business as well as Law graduate, Mealer certainly has an impressive resume but still has a few things to learn.

""Subsequent conversations with Mealer leave us confident that, while her understanding of the system may be incomplete and in some cases even flawed, her main goals are ones we share: better funding of pretrial services and interventions, accountability for the accused, protect judicial discretion and rely on individualized risk assessments, which factor in such things as violent criminal history and gang affiliations in determining someone’s likeliness to reoffend while on bail,"" the Editorial Board writes. ""We don’t like that Mealer’s campaign, like Hidalgo’s, has pandered and stretched the truth in campaign ads. But frankly, we can see Mealer governing more like a technocrat, head down in a spreadsheet planning for impending economic turbulence or stocking flood control with qualified drainage engineers.""",Q4

Sometimes, even the most inflammatory people get to make a great point. It happens.

Back in 2005, that was Ye in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Now, after Kanye West’s antisemitic tirade, it’s Howard Stern’s turn.

Howard knows the very real, personal consequences of antisemitism, as well as the history of it.

He is also quashing an all-too-popular defense that Ye’s defenders keep making.

On the Wednesday, October 19 episode of the Howard Stern Show, the controversial host weighed in on Kanye West.

“I almost don’t want to give any energy to this Kanye West character,” he admitted relatably.

“I don’t know much about Kanye West,” he admitted. That part is less relatable; we’re just envious.

Kanye West sat down with Fox News host Tucker Carlson this week. And the conversation was as bonkers as you would expect. (Photo via Fox News)

“I’m not big into the rap scene, but he is …” Stern trailed off for a moment.

He expressed: “I’m really tired of people excusing his behavior by saying, ‘Well, he’s just mentally ill.'”

We, too, are fatigued with that claim. Mental illness is not an excuse for bigotry — it is also not a cause. Antisemitism is not a disease, it is an evil.

Stern observed that “a lot of media organizations” have been awarding a lot of “attention” to Kanye.

After all, what he described as a “wacky, antisemitic rant he feels free to spout” is difficult to ignore.

Stern then admitted that news organizations were “rightly” discussing him because they were “exposing him.”

Kanye West has been banned from Instagram. The move comes after Kanye hurled racial slurs at comedian Trevor Noah.

But Stern has experienced antisemitism first hand. He relived some of that childhood trauma on air.

He recalled “groups of people with chains hitting me all because they’ve been taught the Jews are evil and killed Jesus.”

Stern continued: “What the f–k. I didn’t kill Jesus. I don’t know Jesus.” Sadly, that experience with bigotry is far from unique.

Howard Stern has a microphone in his face. This means he may say anything at all.

“Good lord, you gotta hear the s–t this guy’s into,” Stern went on.

Remember, Kanye announced that he was going “death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE.” His belief is that a shadowy organization of Jewish people are conspiring to ruin him, which is classic antisemitism.

He commented: “And f–k this mental illness, self-defense thing … ‘Oh yeah, he’s just mentally ill, don’t worry about it.'”

Kanye West suggested that Hollywood “plants” manipulate celebrities for sinister purposes, targeting his ex.

“So mentally ill … they don’t they appoint a conservator over his money like they did with poor Britney Spears?” Stern asked.

Britney Spears’ infamous conservatorship robbed her of her personal freedoms and many human rights for nearly 14 years.

While there are rare cases where some form of guardianship is necessary, Stern’s point is clear: Ye is capable of managing his own life. He understands right from wrong. And he is choosing wrong.

This salary is probably one of the most ridiculous in all of television. To judge America’s Got Talent, Howard Stern makes $15 MILLION. A SEASON. Fifteen. Million. Dollars. To watch people regurgitate random things they’ve swallowed, spin plates, and whatever else people do for their fifteen minutes of fame.

“You know who was mentally ill? The guy that shot up that synagogue in Pittsburgh” Stern suggested. “If he’s that mentally ill, let’s commit him somewhere already.”

For the record, we do not know of any indications that Robert Gregory Bowers’ atrocity was the product of mental illness.

Instead, he appears to be a product of white supremacist radicalization. He didn’t believe in QAnon, for example. Many of his beliefs appeared to stem directly from Fox News hysterics about immigration, linked with antisemitism.

It is nothing short of dangerous to hear someone with Ye’s influence rant about a “Jewish underground media mafia.”

He accused this fictitious organization of sabotaging his career after he wore a “white lives matter” shirt.

For the record, you don’t need an insidious supervillain council to hurt your career when you wear a racist slogan.

Kanye also whined about people do not call him a “billionaire,” an “inventor,” or a “visionary,” but refer to him as a rapper.

“Guess what, douchebag,” Stern commented. “When they write about me, they call me ‘the shock jock.’ You don’t have control over [it].”

He went on: “You’re a rapper. That is what you are. That’s how you became famous.”

Stern lamented that this whole thing has been “so depressing” to process.

“Kanye used to be fun crazy, now he’s like Hitler,” he expressed.

That may be hyperbole, but Ye’s inexplicable influence could lead to real antisemitic violence. Just … not on the scale of the Holocaust. Not by himself, anyway.",Q4

https://www.dawn.com/news/1716040/physical-remand-of-ayaz-amirs-ex-wife-in-sarah-murder-case-extended,Physical remand of Ayaz Amir’s ex-wife in Sarah murder case extended,"ISLAMABAD: The judicial magistrate of Shahzad Town on Thursday handed over the custody of Samina Shah to the police for another two days in connection with the Sarah Inam murder case.

Her son Shahnawaz Amir is the principal accused in the murder case. She was arrested on Wednesday following dismissal of her pre-arrest bail petition.

The Shahzad Town police produced the suspect before Judicial Magistrate Amir Aziz Khan and sought her custody.

On Wednesday, the counsel for the deceased’s father argued that the report of Sarah’s postmortem had disclosed that she was murdered about 12-24 hours before Samina made a telephone call to the police.

He also questioned the shutting down of the CCTV system in the house two days before the incident.

Arsal Javed Hashmi, her counsel, argued that she had informed the police about the incident and extended all-out cooperation with the investigation agency.

He however said the police invoked Section 109 of Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) against her for abetting in the murder. He requested the court to send her on judicial remand.

The judge inquired from the prosecution whether the challan against the accused persons had been prepared or not.

The prosecution informed the court that it will soon be submitted to the court.

The court remanded the suspect in police custody and directed them to produce her after expiry of the remand period.
